As India registered a record jump of 4,213 COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a virtual interaction with chief ministers said that the biggest challenge for the country will be to ensure that the infection does not spread to rural India and that the country will have to devise a ""balanced strategy"" to deal with the pandemic and step up the economic activities in a gradual manner.  Separately, the Union health ministry observed that some relatively large outbreaks have been noticed in particular locations and it is important to focus on containment efforts to ensure that the country does not reach the community transmission stage.  The government also said the coronavirus tracking app Aarogya Setu is secure as it was designed keeping in mind privacy of people and is playing a crucial role in India's fight against COVID-19.  Record jump in number of cases takes total infections to 67,152  In a press briefing on the COVID-19 situation in the country,the health ministry said that a record number of 4,213 COVID-19 cases and 97 deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours ending 8 am, taking the total cases to 67,152 and death toll to 2,206.

However, a PTI tally of figures reported by different states and Union Territories, as of 9.10 pm, put the nationwide tally of confirmed cases much higher at 70,480, showing an increase of more than 6,000 cases since Sunday morning. It showed 2,217 deaths and more than 22,000 recoveries so far.  Maharashtra reported 1,230 new cases, taking the state tally to 23,401, while its death toll rose to 868 after 36 more fatalities.

In the National Capital also, more than 300 new cases were detected.  Fresh cases were reported from various other states as well including Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Bihar and Odisha  Health ministry advocates strong containment measures  Asked if there has been community transmission of COVID-19 in India, joint secretary in the Union health ministry Lav Agarwal said ""Some clusters have been found here (in the country), and in some cases in some particular locations relatively large outbreaks have also been noticed,"" adding that it was important to focus on containment measures so that the country does not reach the stage of community transmission.  Agarwal said the government's focus is on identifying pockets which have been reporting a larger number of cases so that strong containment measures can be implemented.  He also said that people who develop coronavirus symptoms should not go into hiding and come forward to report so that they get timely treatment and also do not spread the infection to their family members and others.  Ajay Sawhney, Chairman, Empowered Group 9, which deals with technology and data management, said the Aarogya Setu app has been developed to alert people before they come in contact with infected patients and to alert the health system. Information about 697 potential COVID-19 hotspots was generated through the app and it is secure,used only for health interventions and does not reveal identity of people, he said. Around 1.4 lakh Aarogya Setu users have been alerted via Bluetooth contact tracing about possible risk of infection due to proximity to infected patients, Sawhney said.  States demand greater freedom in deciding lockdown guidelines  Prime Minister Narendra Modi held the fifth virtual meeting with chief ministers of states to discuss strengthening the containment strategy and gradual resumption of economic activities as the third phase of the nationwide lockdown draws to an end on 17 May.  Economic activities in India are set to ""gather steam"", Modi told the chief ministers, while asserting that the country will have to devise a ""balanced strategy"" to revive the economy and deal with COVID-19 with a sharp focus on ensuring that rural areas remain free from the pandemic, sources told PTI.  According to a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office, the prime minister also asserted that the world has fundamentally changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and said that the new way of life would be on the principle of “Jan Se lekar Jag Tak”, from an individual to the whole of humanity.  ""Even as we look at the gradual withdrawal of the lockdown, we should constantly remember that till we do not find a vaccine or a solution, the biggest weapon with us to the fight the virus is social distancing,"" he said.  Modi also thanked the chief ministers for their proactive role in the country’s fight against the pandemic and asked chief ministers to share by 15 May a broad strategy on how they want to deal with lockdown regime in their states.  ""I am of the firm view that the measures needed in the first phase of lockdown were not needed during the 2nd phase and similarly the measures needed in the 3rd phase are not needed in the fourth,"" he said.  Chief ministers of at least three states demanded that states be given greater freedom in deciding lockdown guidelines. Some chief ministers also sought measures to expand the testing infrastructure, while many of them also demanded fiscal support for the states due to the pandemic having hit hard various revenue-generating economic activities  Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh pitched for the extension of the coronavirus lockdown, but with a carefully crafted exit strategy backed by economic empowerment of states to save lives and secure livelihood. The decision on designating red, orange/yellow and green zones should be left to the states, which are more cognizant of the ground realities, he said.  Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel reiterated the demand that states be allowed to determine green, red and orange zones and the level of economic activity permissible in the state. He also demanded Rs. 30,000 crore for implementing relief and welfare schemes.  Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked for the resumption of economic activities in all parts of the National Capital barring the containment zones.

He also demanded that central armed forces be deployed in the state as the police were under a lot of pressure and there were rising number of cases among police personnel. Thackeray also suggested that local trains be restarted for those providing essential services.  Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that states face different challenges and therefore should be given the freedom to make reasonable changes to the guidelines. He also demanded that states be allowed to resume metro ail services in cities, apart from those in the red zones.

""We know from media that regular train service to Chennai (from Delhi) and from Chennai will commence from 12 May. As the positive cases in Chennai are showing an increasing trend, don’t permit train service up to 31 May in my state,"" Tamil Nadu chief minister E Palaniswami told Modi during the virtual meeting.  West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on one hand, the Centre wants strict enforcement of the lockdown, on the other, it is resuming train services.  According to the statement, Modi said that the resumption of rail services was needed to rev up economic activity, but all routes will not be opened.  The Home Ministry earlier said that only asymptomatic people with confirmed tickets will be allowed to travel in 15 trains to be operational from Tuesday. Online bookings began for these trains on Monday evening, after some delay due to a technical glitch, and some routes got fully booked within ten minutes.  The Railways have been running 'migrant special' trains for ferrying migrant workers since May 1, but this will be the first time in nearly 50 days that the general public can also undertake train journeys even though flight and inter-state bus services remain suspended as of now till May 17, when the third phase of the lockdown is scheduled to end.  The first phase of the nationwide lockdown began on 25 March, which was supposed to be of 21 days, but it got extended later till 3 May and then further till 17 May with some relaxation.

1,"Lockdown extension in India: More curbs to go, but lockdown to stay, PM hints at CMs meet","PM Narendra Modi (ANI)  Focus now should be to stop  Covid  from spreading to rural areas: PM  NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi indicated steps to open the economy would continue to be pursued in line with relaxations announced so far even as efforts to reduce incidence of Covid-19 continue apace and social distancing norms are followed.Modi hinted that a more graded relaxation of the lockdown could be on its way after May 17, during an interaction with chief ministers on Monday. “I am of the firm view that the measures needed in the first phase of lockdown were not needed during the second phase and, similarly, the measures needed in the third phase are not needed in the fourth,” an official release quoted the PM as saying.“We have a twofold challenge — to reduce the transmission rate of the disease and to increase public activity gradually — while adhering to all the guidelines,” he said.The long interaction, where all the CMs spoke, saw some in favour of continuing with the lockdown beyond May 17. Given the focus on containment, the lockdown may not be called off even as more easing of curbs, particularly in ‘green zones’, is on the anvil.While Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee complained about the Centre’s “unilateral” actions, she like other CMs such as Uddhav Thackeray and Nitish Kumar favoured extension of the lockdown. Kumar expressed reservations on resumption of train services.Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan said states should be allowed to decide on public transport while Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik suggested there should be broad lockdown principles. Thackeray expressed concern over reports of a second wave of infection in China.Sources said the Prime Minister was very conscious about the need to continue all efforts to contain the disease so that gains of the lockdown were not lost and also referred indirectly to the need to concentrate on problematic areas.“We now have a reasonably clear indication as to the geographical spread of the pandemic in India, including worst affected areas. Moreover, over the past few weeks, officials have understood operating procedures in a time such as this, right up to the district level,” Modi said, suggesting that the disease tracking mechanism was gaining experience and becoming more effective.The PM further said now the effort should be to stop the spread of Covid-19 to rural areas. The comment came in the context of rural areas having remained relatively free of infections.He said one must understand that the world had fundamentally changed post Covid-19. “Now, the world will be pre-corona, post-corona just like the case of the world wars,” he added. PM Modi said the new way of life would be on the principle of “jaan se lekar jag tak”, from an individual to the whole of humanity.In Video: More graded relaxation of lockdown after May 17, PM Modi hints at CMs meet"
2,PM Narendra Modi to address the nation at 8 pm today,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation today at 8 pm, amid speculations about lockdown 4.0. PM Modi's address comes a day after his meeting with chief ministers over the Covid-19-induced lockdown. Taking to Twitter, the prime minister's office said, ""PM Modi will be addressing the nation at 8 PM this evening.""  Shri @narendramodi will be addressing the nation at 8 PM this evening. — PMO India (@PMOIndia) May 12, 2020  This will be the Prime Minister's fourth special address to the nation in the last two months.The Prime Minister first addressed the nation on March 18 and appealed to the people to observe 'Janata Curfew' between 9 am to 9 pm on March 22. On March 24, he announced the 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 and then on April 14 he announced extending it for another 19 days till May 3. However, the government later announced the extension of the lockdown for two more weeks on May 1. India is in the third phase of lockdown which will end on May 17.  On Monday, PM Modi held a video conference meeting with Chief Ministers of all states to discuss the road ahead in India's fight against the novel coronavirus. He said the need was to reduce the transmission rate of Covid-19 and to increase public activity gradually while adhering to all the guidelines.

3,What Modi Got Wrong On Covid-19 And How He Can Fix It - By Ramachandra Guha,"In the wake of COVID-19, millions of school and college students all over the world are taking classes via Zoom. Such distance learning, however, is not merely for the young. It can be enormously helpful for us older folks too. Thus, earlier this week, I enrolled in a two-hour class conducted by the country's top public health experts, which gave me a deeper and more profound understanding of the current pandemic than 'prime-time' TV shows ever could.  Of the panelists, two were civil servants who served many years in the health sector, two were doctors-turned-community health specialists, two others doctors-turned-university professors. These six experts have three things in common; all live and work in India, all are highly regarded by their professional peers, and none have been consulted by the Modi Government. (Among the modest hopes of this column is that the latter may yet be reversed).  I took copious notes as I listened to these experts, and summarize what I learnt in what follows. It now seems clear that while the initial lockdown controlled the spread of the disease, the government did not use the time and breathing space gained to vigorously promote testing, accurately identify potential or emerging hotspots, or convey accurate and reliable information to the public.  The social and economic aspects of the lockdown have been widely criticized. By its precipitate action, the central government abruptly deprived citizens of jobs and livelihoods. By giving them only four hours' notice, millions of workers were stranded far away from their homes, with no food, shelter, or cash. Yet, even from the point of view of public health, the first lockdown was very poorly planned. In mid-March, few workers who wished to return to their villages were infected. If these citizens had been given time to travel home, they would have re-entered their villages in a safe manner. Six weeks later, when the government wants to belatedly make amends by arranging trains for migrants, tens of thousands of returnees are carriers of the deadly virus. The centre is now trying to pass the buck on to the states, but it is, of course, the Prime Minister who bears ultimate responsibility for what is unquestionably the greatest man-made tragedy in the country since Partition.  There has been a pronounced class bias in how the lockdown was conceived and executed. As a result, already pervasive social inequalities have deepened even further. The loss of jobs and incomes has pushed millions of working-class Indians into near-destitution. As they shall now have less food to eat, and of poorer quality too, they will become more vulnerable to diseases of different kinds, not just COVID-19.  There are many things the Modi Government has done wrong with regard to the pandemic. As the result of their mistakes, the devastation has been immense. Our economy is in the doldrums, our social fabric is strained, our health system over-stressed. Yet there are many things the Modi Government could still do right. In this regard, the experts I listened to offered five major pieces of advice.  First, there should be absolutely no sense of complacency. So far the virus has not spread very deeply into the countryside. States like Assam, Odisha and Chhattisgarh have a low incidence of cases. But this is likely to change in coming months, and as the cases in these states multiply, the fragility of their public health systems will be exposed.  Second, the government must get on board our top epidemiologists working outside the ICMR system. Experts who helped us effectively tackle HIV, the H1N1 virus, and polio in the recent past have not been consulted. Their knowledge could have been of immense value in framing suitable policies to tackle this latest epidemic. It still can.  Third, epidemics are not just a biomedical issue, but also a social issue. There are signs that COVID-19 has already led to a rise in alcoholism, domestic abuse, depression and suicide. These, as much as death and disease, poverty and unemployment, will be the inevitable consequences of the pandemic. Therefore, it is not just public health experts, not just economists, but sociologists and psychologists with domain expertise who must also be consulted by the government.  Fourth, the Modi Government must rethink its current 'control-and-command' model of administration. The centre must learn to respect the states far more than it currently does. Funds already owed to the states have to be rapidly released, and additional funds granted, since it is the states that are in the forefront of the battle to contain the pandemic. We need a far greater decentralization of governance, from the centre to the states, and from state capitals to panchayats and municipalities. The successes achieved so far, in districts like Bhilwara or states like Kerala, are the result of a bottom-up approach and of vigorous local leadership.  Unfortunately, instead of following this path, the Modi Government is cynically misusing the pandemic to centralize powers further. The Prime Minister's penchant to make this a personal show, all about himself, is problematic enough; and along with it come the punitive methods of the Home Minister. A distinguished panelist, when asked how the government should act in the days and weeks to come, simply said: ""Keep the Ministry of Home Affairs completely out of all covid-related matters and decisions"".  Fifth, in tackling the pandemic, we need to evolve a spirit of solidarity with one another. In the six years that the Modi Government has been in power, it has been extremely hostile to, and distrustful, of NGOs. The pandemic may finally open their eyes to the enormously positive role that this sector can play in mitigating distress. Whether it be food kitchens for those rendered destitute, advice on medical matters, or providing shelter and counselling, civil society organizations have done outstanding work in recent weeks.  As we look to the future, we can take hope in the fact that, as compared to Europe and North America, ours is a much younger population. In India, the pandemic may (with luck) claim fewer lives. That said, once it has passed, we will need to rebuild our economy, our society, and our health systems with the greatest care and attention. If this rebuilding is to happen, the ways of the union government must change dramatically. It must learn to give states greater autonomy (as well as more money). It must allow independent thought and civil society organizations to flourish, rather than seek to suppress them at every turn. But the ways of the Prime Minister must radically change too. He needs to listen more attentively, and consult more widely. He must never again rush unilaterally and without thought into decisions whose awful consequences he has not anticipated.  As the panel discussion I listened to so strikingly showed, the country has a vast array of scientific and administrative expertise that the Prime Minister and the union government can call upon for advice in coping with a post-COVID world. Whether they are large-hearted and open-minded enough to do so is, of course, another matter altogether.  (Ramachandra Guha is a historian based in Bengaluru.

As India registered a record jump of 4,213 COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a virtual interaction with chief ministers said that the biggest challenge for the country will be to ensure that the infection does not spread to rural India and that the country will have to devise a ""balanced strategy"" to deal with the pandemic and step up the economic activities in a gradual manner.  Separately, the Union health ministry observed that some relatively large outbreaks have been noticed in particular locations and it is important to focus on containment efforts to ensure that the country does not reach the community transmission stage.  The government also said the coronavirus tracking app Aarogya Setu is secure as it was designed keeping in mind privacy of people and is playing a crucial role in India's fight against COVID-19.  Record jump in number of cases takes total infections to 67,152  In a press briefing on the COVID-19 situation in the country,the health ministry said that a record number of 4,213 COVID-19 cases and 97 deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours ending 8 am, taking the total cases to 67,152 and death toll to 2,206.

According to the health ministry data, Maharashtra has reported the highest number of infections (22,171) and fatalities (832) with Gujarat following with 8,194 cases and 493 deaths.  However, a PTI tally of figures reported by different states and Union Territories, as of 9.10 pm, put the nationwide tally of confirmed cases much higher at 70,480, showing an increase of more than 6,000 cases since Sunday morning. It showed 2,217 deaths and more than 22,000 recoveries so far.  Maharashtra reported 1,230 new cases, taking the state tally to 23,401, while its death toll rose to 868 after 36 more fatalities. Tamil Nadu reported 798 new cases and six more deaths on Monday. Mumbai's case count reached 14,355 with 791 new cases detected on Monday, while its death toll is 528 now with 20 more fatalities.

In the National Capital also, more than 300 new cases were detected.  Fresh cases were reported from various other states as well including Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Bihar and Odisha  Health ministry advocates strong containment measures  Asked if there has been community transmission of COVID-19 in India, joint secretary in the Union health ministry Lav Agarwal said ""Some clusters have been found here (in the country), and in some cases in some particular locations relatively large outbreaks have also been noticed,"" adding that it was important to focus on containment measures so that the country does not reach the stage of community transmission.  Agarwal said the government's focus is on identifying pockets which have been reporting a larger number of cases so that strong containment measures can be implemented.  He also said that people who develop coronavirus symptoms should not go into hiding and come forward to report so that they get timely treatment and also do not spread the infection to their family members and others.  Ajay Sawhney, Chairman, Empowered Group 9, which deals with technology and data management, said the Aarogya Setu app has been developed to alert people before they come in contact with infected patients and to alert the health system. Information about 697 potential COVID-19 hotspots was generated through the app and it is secure,used only for health interventions and does not reveal identity of people, he said. Around 1.4 lakh Aarogya Setu users have been alerted via Bluetooth contact tracing about possible risk of infection due to proximity to infected patients, Sawhney said.  States demand greater freedom in deciding lockdown guidelines  Prime Minister Narendra Modi held the fifth virtual meeting with chief ministers of states to discuss strengthening the containment strategy and gradual resumption of economic activities as the third phase of the nationwide lockdown draws to an end on 17 May.  Economic activities in India are set to ""gather steam"", Modi told the chief ministers, while asserting that the country will have to devise a ""balanced strategy"" to revive the economy and deal with COVID-19 with a sharp focus on ensuring that rural areas remain free from the pandemic, sources told PTI.  According to a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office, the prime minister also asserted that the world has fundamentally changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and said that the new way of life would be on the principle of “Jan Se lekar Jag Tak”, from an individual to the whole of humanity.  ""Even as we look at the gradual withdrawal of the lockdown, we should constantly remember that till we do not find a vaccine or a solution, the biggest weapon with us to the fight the virus is social distancing,"" he said.  Modi also thanked the chief ministers for their proactive role in the country’s fight against the pandemic and asked chief ministers to share by 15 May a broad strategy on how they want to deal with lockdown regime in their states.  ""I am of the firm view that the measures needed in the first phase of lockdown were not needed during the 2nd phase and similarly the measures needed in the 3rd phase are not needed in the fourth,"" he said.  Chief ministers of at least three states demanded that states be given greater freedom in deciding lockdown guidelines. Some chief ministers also sought measures to expand the testing infrastructure, while many of them also demanded fiscal support for the states due to the pandemic having hit hard various revenue-generating economic activities  Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh pitched for the extension of the coronavirus lockdown, but with a carefully crafted exit strategy backed by economic empowerment of states to save lives and secure livelihood. The decision on designating red, orange/yellow and green zones should be left to the states, which are more cognizant of the ground realities, he said.  Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel reiterated the demand that states be allowed to determine green, red and orange zones and the level of economic activity permissible in the state. He also demanded Rs. 30,000 crore for implementing relief and welfare schemes.  Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked for the resumption of economic activities in all parts of the National Capital barring the containment zones.

He also demanded that central armed forces be deployed in the state as the police were under a lot of pressure and there were rising number of cases among police personnel. Thackeray also suggested that local trains be restarted for those providing essential services.  Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that states face different challenges and therefore should be given the freedom to make reasonable changes to the guidelines. He also demanded that states be allowed to resume metro ail services in cities, apart from those in the red zones.

""We know from media that regular train service to Chennai (from Delhi) and from Chennai will commence from 12 May. As the positive cases in Chennai are showing an increasing trend, don’t permit train service up to 31 May in my state,"" Tamil Nadu chief minister E Palaniswami told Modi during the virtual meeting.  West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on one hand, the Centre wants strict enforcement of the lockdown, on the other, it is resuming train services.  According to the statement, Modi said that the resumption of rail services was needed to rev up economic activity, but all routes will not be opened.  The Home Ministry earlier said that only asymptomatic people with confirmed tickets will be allowed to travel in 15 trains to be operational from Tuesday. Online bookings began for these trains on Monday evening, after some delay due to a technical glitch, and some routes got fully booked within ten minutes.  The Railways have been running 'migrant special' trains for ferrying migrant workers since May 1, but this will be the first time in nearly 50 days that the general public can also undertake train journeys even though flight and inter-state bus services remain suspended as of now till May 17, when the third phase of the lockdown is scheduled to end.  The first phase of the nationwide lockdown began on 25 March, which was supposed to be of 21 days, but it got extended later till 3 May and then further till 17 May with some relaxation.

5,Chinese helicopters spotted in Eastern Ladakh along India-China border: Sources,"New Delhi: Chinese helicopters were spotted flying close to the undemarcated border between India and China in Eastern Ladakh after around 250 soldiers of both sides were engaged in a fierce face-off near Pangong Lake in the area last week, official sources said.  The situation in the area remained tensed after the violent clashes between the troops on Tuesday evening, they said. Next day, both sides agreed to end the face-off at a meeting of local commanders.  The Chinese military helicopters were seen flying close to the Line of Actual Control on at least a couple of occasions following the clashes after which a fleet of Su-30 fighters of the Indian Air Force too carried out sorties in the area, the sources said.  There was no official word on whether the Su-30 jets were rushed in to carry out the sorties in the wake of the face-off and aggressive Chinese posturing in the area.  Following the fracas, both sides brought in additional troops.  The sources said Chinese military helicopters routinely carry out sorties on the Chinese side of the border while Indian Army helicopters also fly in the area.  In the face-off on May 5, scores of Indian and Chinese army personnel clashed along the northern bank of the Pangong Lake and even resorted to stone-pelting.  A number of soldiers on both the sides sustained injuries.  It was the first case of troops from the two sides exchanging blows after a similar incident around the Pangong Lake in August 2017.  In a separate incident, nearly 150 Indian and Chinese military personnel were engaged in a face-off near Naku La Pass in the Sikkim sector of the Sino-India border on Saturday. At least 10 soldiers from both the sides sustained injuries in the incident.  The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction in 2017 which even triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.  The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control, the de-facto border between the two countries.  China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.  Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquility in border areas.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first informal summit in April 2018 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, months after the Doklam standoff.  In the summit, the two leaders decided to issue ""strategic guidance"" to their militaries to strengthen communications so that they can build trust and understanding.  Modi and Xi held their second informal summit in Mamallapuram near Chennai in October last year with a focus on further broadening the bilateral ties."

7,"Chinese Choppers Spotted Near Ladakh LAC Prompt Alert, IAF Fighters Rushed In","Air Force frequently flies its Sukhoi 30MKI fighter aircraft fleet from Leh air base in Ladakh (File)  After the scuffle between the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops and Indian troops along the LAC in North Sikkim which led to injuries on both sides, China appears to be continuing on the path of belligerence towards India, this time along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.  In what appears to be a multi-front deliberate ploy by China to keep India on its toes the Indian Air Force was forced to rush its fighter jet patrols in Ladakh after Chinese military choppers were found to be flying close to the Line of Actual Control. This incident happened last week, around the same time the PLA troops and Indian army forces came to blows in the upper reaches of North Sikkim.  ""The Chinese military helicopters were flying very close to the Line of Actual Control. After their movement was picked up, the Indian Air Force fighter jets flew patrols in the area,"" government sources told ANI here.  Government sources who requested anonymity due to knowledge of frontline operations, informed that the Chinese choppers did not cross the LAC into Indian territory in that particular area, they said.  The Indian Air Force frequently flies its Sukhoi 30MKI fighter aircraft fleet from Leh air base in Ladakh along with other planes.  This latest development comes soon after the Indian security establishment noticed that Pakistani Air Force increased its patrols of F-16S and JF-17s along its Eastern Border with India, especially night sorties, after the Handwara terror attack that led to the death of 5 Indian security personnel. A fear of retaliation by Indian forces was cited as the reason by Indian security establishment sources for this ramping up of PAF air patrols.  The Indian Air Force has two main bases in the Ladakh union territory including the Leh and the Thoise airbase where fighter jets are not deployed permanently but detachments from combat aircraft squadrons are operational throughout the year.  There have been several occasions in the past when Chinese military helicopters have entered Indian airspace in the Ladakh sector and deliberately left behind tell-tale signs to stake claim on areas which are part of India. The LAC in this location, like in other parts of the India-China border in the country, is poorly demarcated, hence incursions sometimes are inadvertent as well.  However, the scuffle with Indian troops in North Sikkim was a new front opened up by China which was a cause for concern. Ever since the outbreak of Covid-19, Chinese President Xi Jinping is under immense pressure to increase transparency in his country and reveal the real origin of the virus, which some have speculated emanated from a lab in China''s Wuhan. Trade wars with countries like USA and Australia have intensified and most multi-national companies have actively begun looking for manufacturing alternative, India being one such preferred destination.  Security sources speculated that this could be the reason behind China's new aggression. Similar muscle flexing was also seen recently when PLA Navy boats entered into disputed waters in the South China Sea.

8,Sikkim Showdown: China Paving The Way For More Such Confrontations With India in Future,"Like some of the previous episodes, the face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the Sino-Indian boundary in Sikkim doesn’t appear to be a coincidence. In all likelihood, these incidents are planned days in advance at a higher level in China which are then translated into action by the army along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).    The showdown in Sikkim came on the heels of a slew of decisions by the Indian government which certainly did not enthuse Beijing. India has begun to lure business houses planning to leave China. Some media reports, quoting anonymous sources, claimed that India is developing a land pool nearly double the size of Luxembourg for the purpose. Existing industrial land in states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are included in the scheme.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms have been changed to prevent the takeover of Indian firms during the lockdown which has elicited a sharp reaction from China. India has also cancelled orders of half a million rapid testing kits for Covid-19 following complaints of fault.  “It cannot be denied that such episodes like the face-off in Sikkim carry a message from China. Sometimes there is a pattern but at the same time incursions by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have also taken place without any reason,” said a government official who was posted at Upper Subansiri district in Arunachal Pradesh. He explained that there have been several occasions when the Indian army had stepped into China since the border is disputed at several points.  It is worthwhile to recall the incident at Ladakh when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited India four months after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to power in 2014. As Xi arrived in India, over 1,000 Chinese soldiers entered a disputed area in northern Ladakh, triggering a stand-off with Indian troops. They pulled back only when the president wrapped up his visit after three days during which he declared that Beijing was committed to working with New Delhi to maintain “peace and tranquility"" until the border issue could be settled and pledged greater investment from China.  Xi’s assurances notwithstanding, the Chinese army continued with its aggressive patrols along the LAC. Last year the government informed Parliament that there were 326 instances of incursion by the Chinese soldiers into Indian territory in 2018 which was less than 426 in 2017 but higher than the figure recorded in 2016.  Among government officials, there are two schools of thought on the implication of such incidents along the LAC. Most Indian diplomats dismiss these face-offs as insignificant and routine that would not have any adverse impact on the ties between the two neighbours. But intelligence officials are not as optimistic even as they point to the infrastructure being upgraded by China along the LAC, making it increasingly easier for the PLA to mount patrols right up to the border. They are apprehensive that specks of territory could be lost since India is yet to catch up with the progress being made on the other side.  The difference is most palpable at Anjaw district in Arunachal Pradesh which witnessed action during the Chinese aggression in 1962. Locals at the border village of Kaho are of the opinion that the build-up across the border has been increasing over the years with a four-lane highway now linking the place with other regions.  The same state of affairs is also observed across the LAC at Bumla, Mechuka and Taksing in the border state which would soon be connected by a highway originating at China’s southwestern province of Yunnan. Motorable roads have been built in a majority of the passes along the LAC that are of military significance.  Whether this network of roads would lead to a spurt in incursions by Chinese soldiers remains to be seen. But certainly Beijing is in no mood to resolve the border dispute very soon. The talks are likely to continue indefinitely without any result and they could also be interspersed with Wuhan-type summits and declarations.

9,No continuing face-off with China at Pangong Tso lake; no build-up of troops in the area: Indian Army,"Indian Army  New Delhi: The Indian Army, on Tuesday, clarified that there is no continuing face-off at Pangong Tso lake and that there is no build up of armed troops in that area  The Army further said that media speculation and hype should be avoided an that all the short-duration face-offs are resolved by the troops mutually.  News agency ANI quoted the Army officials as saying, ""Incidents of face-off and aggressive behaviour occur on LAC. Patrols disengage after local level interaction and dialogue. Temporary and short duration faceoffs occur as a boundary is not resolved.""  Face-offs resolved mutually by following protocol  It was further said that the troops resolve mutually as per established protocols and that the media speculation and hype based on unsubstantiated statements should be avoided.  The clarification came days after media reports suggested that the troops of India and China were engaged in two face-offs in Eastern Ladakh and North Sikkim along the disputed LAC.  Recent face-offs between the troops  The reports further suggested that the troops from both sides had sustained injuries in the face-offs. The reports had come after the Indian Army sources said that on May 5 and 6, there was a face-off between the Indian and Chinese troops in the Eastern Ladakh sector.  The Army had earlier too, said that the matter was resolved at the local level between the two sides. Soon before that incident, the troops of the two countries had a face-off in Nakula area of North Sikkim a day ago in which soldiers of both sides sustained injuries.  What is LAC?  LAC is the short for the Line of Actual Control which is the boundary one between India and China and separates Indian-controlled territory from Chinese-controlled territory in the Jammu and Kashmir. LAC is said to have formed after the 1962 war."
10,"In Bengal, Covid-19 red zones to be divided into 3: CM Mamata","india  Updated: May 12, 2020 18:20 IST  West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday announced that the Covid-19 red zones in the state will be further divided into three categories. The CM added that more relaxations will be given in these zones.  “The red zones would be further divided into three categories. Steps would also be taken to restart the 100-day work scheme in the non-containment areas,” said Mamata Banerjee.  There are at least 566 containment zones in the state. Out of them, Kolkata has 326 containment areas.  Banerjee claimed that people were facing problems since the imposition of the lockdown on March 25 as the move was “poorly planned”.  “Don’t think we will get relief from the Covid-19 crisis anytime soon. We should have a three-month short term plan in place to tackle the situation,” she said after a review meeting with state officials.  Talking about her interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his video conference with chief ministers on Monday, Banerjee said Bengal gained nothing from the meeting and was left “empty-handed”.  The Centre is yet to clear the “legitimate financial dues” of the state, she claimed.  “I have raised several issues during the meeting with PM. But I must say we always return empty-handed after our meetings with the PM. We are yet to get our dues,” the chief minister said.  Referring to the communal clashes that broke out in Hooghly district last week, Banerjee said action will be taken against those found guilty.  “Stern action will be taken against those involved in communal clashes amid the lockdown. No one will be spared if found guilty,” she added."

The Inter-Ministerial Central Team that visited Kolkata, Howrah, and certain other districts in West Bengal, to check its coronavirus preparation, has accused it of low testing, weak surveillance, and discrepancies in reporting cases.  In a meeting with the prime minister on Sunday, Mamata Banerjee accused the Centre of “playing politics and ignoring the states.” She took on the PM, Home Minister Amit Shah as well as Central government officials, questioning their actions in the midst of a pandemic. She was among the CMs who opposed the Centre’s plan to dilute the lockdown and start the train service.  West Bengal has so far reported 118 deaths due to coronavirus infection.

12,Mamata Banerjee tears into the Centre at PMs conference,"NEW DELHI: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee tore into the Centre at the Prime Minister’s conference with the Chief Ministers on Monday, launching a scathing attack on particularly the Union Home Ministry for discriminating against the state.""I respect Mr. Amit Shah. Last time also he spoke about West Bengal and I could not counter him because I was not given a chance. But, why did Mr. Amit Shah need to write a letter and send that to the press? After it was out in the news, people were asking me. What am I supposed to do? Why don’t you speak to us directly? Why letters are being sent to the media with rampant accusations?"" the West Bengal CM said at the meeting.Tensions between the Centre and West Bengal government came to a head as Banerjee got a chance to speak at the video-conference and she accused the Centre of targeting her government even as she was co-operating with the Centre in the fight against Covid-19. Officials said the CM was extremely upset over the Centre pre-deciding parameters and modalities of the lockdown without any consultation with the state. “If you continue to conduct meetings after having taken the decision, then what is the point of the meeting?” she said.“Why always target West Bengal? We are not even consulted before decisions are taken before-hand from Delhi are imposed on us. Teams from Centre are sent without any prior notice. Will the state work or hold meetings with the central teams? If the central teams ask our chief secretary and health secretary to come and guide them, then how will they continue their work? Or should we call them as ‘Babus’ and behave as bonded labourers? Hon’ble Prime Minister you know this, you have been a Chief Minister of a state yourself. All states must get their due respect,” Banerjee told PM and Home Minister in a no-holds barred attack.“We have been working relentlessly yet some of the central ministers are sitting and doing politics. States must be given independence regarding handling of lockdown because states understand the situation on the ground better. You have to maintain the federal structure. Leaking letters is not in the federal spirit. Let us rise above the politics,” the CM said. She also questioned why Railways was charging fares from migrants and said if the Centre cannot pay, she is willing to pay the fares. “I request Mr. Amit Shah to ensure that no money is taken from the migrant workers. They do not have money. If it is needed, please ask us, we will pay,” the CM told the PM and the Home Minister.Banerjee said the Centre owed West Bengal a huge sum of nearly Rs 53,000 Cr, including GST dues. “Corona positive cases in Bengal are 200 per 10 Crore. Even though we had less testing centres and faulty kits, Bengal has done better than many other states on many parameters,” the CM said, defending her state’s record.“We all know this virus has come from outside India. Yet, when we are not pointing fingers at any other country, why are we pointing fingers at our own states and our own people? How can we hold our own people responsible? How can we raise fingers at them,” the CM said.Banerjee added that West Bengal is a very sensitive state and one cannot compare Bengal with Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland or Bihar. “ West Bengal is surrounded by the Bangladesh border, Nepal border and also the north-eastern regions. It is very difficult to control everything together,” she told the PM."
13,"With Mamata hitting out at Centre during meeting with Modi, TMC-BJP verbal duel intensifies","india  Updated: May 12, 2020 07:45 IST  The war of words between Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) intensified on Monday after the West Bengal chief minister’s outburst against the Centre during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with chief ministers.  Both parties sharpened attacks on each other, with the TMC targeting PM Modi for an ill-planned lockdown and late response to the Covid-19 situation and the BJP hitting out at the state government for not doing enough during the coronavirus pandemic and “a collapse of the administration.”  “The PM held no meeting with the chief ministers before announcing the lockdown. The centre thought they could handle the situation in 15 days and would then alone take the credit of it all,” Abhishek Banerjee, Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing chief, was heard saying in a video clip released by the party.  “Meetings with chief ministers are being held before announcing the second and third phase lockdown because the situation is not in control. Why didn’t they think of and plan for the migrant workers before announcing the lockdown?” Abhishek Banerjee asked.  “There are apprehensions about the fallout of letting long-distance trains run. They Centre should provide all with more clarity,” TMC secretary-general and state education minister Partha Chatterjee said.  He, too, alleged that BJP was busy playing politics when the focus should have been on putting up a unit fight against Covid-19.  Mamata Banerjee had hit out at Centre in the afternoon during the video-conference with Modi, alleging it was trying to gain political mileage at the expense of the state government.  “We as a state doing our best to combat the virus. The Centre should not play politics in this crucial time. We are surrounded by international borders and other bigger states and have challenges to deal with… All the states should be given equal importance and we should work together as Team India,” she said adding that the federal structure should be respected.  In the evening, BJP leaders targeted the state government of minority appeasement, mismanagement over bringing migrant workers back, implementing a lax lockdown and failure in managing the public distribution system.  “The Centre is not playing politics. The Centre had to intervene because the state was failing its people. The state played hide and seek with data and the real Covid-19 scenario, let the lockdown be easily violated, corrupted the public distribution system and also wanted to leave the migrant workers at lurch,” BJP’s state unit president Dilip Ghosh said.  “In every case, the state acted after the Centre intervened. The government has failed in most critical aspects – health and home affairs – and both portfolios are held by the chief minister,” Ghosh added.  “It’s not a time for politics. It’s a national crisis and the time is for uniting under the leadership of the prime minister and fight Covid-19,” BJP national executive member Mukul Roy said.  All senior leaders of the West Bengal unit of the BJP, including central observers Kailash Vijayvargiya, Shiv Prakash and Arvind Menon, Union ministers Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri and members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, also took digs at the Mamata Banerjee government for utmost failure."
14,"""Realise Deadliness Of Virus"": Indian-American Doctor To Mamata Banerjee On COVID-19","Dr Indranill Basu Ray has urged Mamata Banerjee to take urgent steps to stop the spread of COVID-19  Describing the coronavirus as exceptionally infective and highly lethal, an eminent Indian-American cardiologist has urged West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee not to take anything for granted and take all necessary steps to prevent large-scale illness and fatalities in the state.  Tennessee-based Dr Indranill Basu Ray, in a letter to Ms Banerjee, said that India, including West Bengal, may be lucky because of a different viral strain not having such a severe infection.  ""I am compelled to point out the fact that as West Bengal is exceptionally crowded, the virus, if it infects a particular locality, will spread like wildfire, affecting thousands and killing quite a few,"" he said.  It is essential to maintain strict social distancing and ensure that this dangerous virus could be prevented from spreading and killing as it has been doing in certain western countries, the cardiologist said in his letter.  ""We cannot take anything for granted as you will regret if thousands are infected, and hundreds start dying because of a lack of strictness in preventing the spread and appropriate detection of COVID-19.  ""I would therefore kindly request you to take urgent steps to realise the deadliness of this virus and the fact that it is a killing machine. Appropriate measures, including augmented testing, isolation of all contacts, and forceful enforcement of the lockdown, are mandatory to prevent the exact scenario as seen in the west,"" he said, adding that the coronavirus is exceptionally infective and highly lethal.  Dr Ray, a cardiologist and cardiac electrophysiologist who has also been a Professor of medicine and public health at multiple universities in the US and India, expressed shock that instead of doctors, a committee has been asked to provide COVID-19 death certificates.  ""Hushing up such infection and not taking appropriate precautions like isolation would lead to death and destruction, which I certainly know that you would not like as the Chief Minister of my state,"" he added.  In India, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased to 67,152, after a record number of 4,213 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours till Monday 8 AM, while the death toll rose by 97 to 2,206, the Union Health Ministry said in its daily update.  In West Bengal, there were at least 1,939 confirmed COVID-19 cases as on Monday. A total of 118 people have lost their lives due to the coronavirus in the state."
15,Aarogya Setu App Gets Just 2 Out of 5 stars in MIT Technology Review for COVID Contact Tracing Apps,"As India attempts to emerge from the various stages of lockdown in an attempt to flatten the COVID curve, there is a renewed push to get the citizens to download and install the Aarogya Setu app on their smartphones. Official numbers suggest that the Aarogya Setu app has been installed on 9.8 crore smartphones so far. But there has been a raging debate about the privacy and surveillance aspects of the app, with critics alleging that the app with its access to your location and Bluetooth proximity data, can be used for illegal surveillance. New and fresh fuel has been added to the fire.  A Covid Tracing Tracker has been launched by the renowned publication MIT Technology Review and they are working with experts around the world to understand what each COVID contact tracing app offers, and the issues around it. At this time, they have compared and ranked the Contact Tracing apps launched in 25 countries, including India’s Aarogya Setu. The apps are being ranked on five parameters—is it voluntary or not, is it being solely used for public health purposes or there are usage scenarios for law enforcement, is the user data collected by the app deleted within a reasonable amount of time and whether the entire process is transparent.  “India is the only democracy making its app mandatory for millions of people""  Have you also read?  Aarogya Setu Flaw Can Allow Any User to be Tracked Down, Claims Hacker    Aarogya Setu 'Highly Encrypted', Data Only Shared with Select Govt Officers: Kant  This is how the MIT Technology Review describes each of the parameters.    - Is it voluntary? In some cases, apps are opt-in—but in other places many or all citizens are compelled to download and use them.    - Are there limitations on how the data gets used? Data may sometimes be used for purposes other than public health, such as law enforcement—and that may last longer than covid-19.    - Will data be destroyed after a period of time? The data the apps collect should not last forever. If it is automatically deleted in a reasonable amount of time (usually a maximum of around 30 days) or the app allows users to manually delete their own data, we award a star.    - Is data collection minimized? Does the app collect only the information it needs to do what it says?    - Is the effort transparent? Transparency can take the form of clear, publicly available policies and design, an open-source code base, or all of these.  In case of every answer that is a yes, the app gets a star. For any answer that is a no, or the data for the same isn’t clear, there is no star.  The apps that get five stars are Austria’s Stopp Corona app, Czech’s eRouska, Iceland’s Rakning C-19, Israel’s HaMagen, Singapore’s Trace Together and Norway’s Smittestopp. Following these with four stars are Australia’s COVIDSafe, CovTracer from Cyprus, Italy’s Immuni and Poland’s ProteGO.  India’s Aarogya Setu only gets stars for the policy which suggests that data that is collected is deleted after a period of time and that the data collection is minimal  China's contact tracing system gets no stars. One of the reasons for that is the complete lack of transparency around how it works, what data is collected and how that data is handled, encrypted and deleted. ""There is very little information available to the public about how China's technology works,"" say the researchers.  India’s Aarogya Setu only gets stars for the policy which suggests that data that is collected is deleted after a period of time and that the data collection, as far as user inputs go, is minimal. However, the app doesn’t score any points (or stars) for being voluntary, for its usage being limited to public health and for transparency. “India is the only democracy making its app mandatory for millions of people,” says the research.  There have been significant concerns about Aarogya Setu , that it’s potential usage far surpasses the COVID contact tracing angle that is attached with it right now. It is not voluntary, which means it is being forced on to millions of users in the country. The fears that its location data will be used for tracking and surveillance, refuse to go away. The policies and communication around the app also don’t come across as entirely transparent.  Similar fears have been voiced in other countries. Apple and Google, in an unprecedented partnership, are developing a COVID contact tracing platform for iPhones and Android phones, which these apps will rely on. The two tech giants say they will limit location access to these apps .  As for the voluntary bit—a few hours ago, the Indian Railways made it mandatory for anyone who wants to travel on its trains, must have the Aarogya Setu app installed. It is expected that airlines will also have similar guidelines in place when air travel resumes. In the city of Noida, it is now illegal to step outside without the Aarogya Setu app installed on your phone.  Contact tracing is critical in curbing the Coronavirus spread around the country and indeed around the world. A person who may be infected with the COVID-19 virus may not show any signs or symptoms for as many as 14 days more but can spread the infection in the meantime through cough, for instance. As and when a confirmed COVID case is taken in for treatment, health authorities scramble to track as many people this infected person may have met in the past few days.  However, the MIT Technology reports that Iceland isn’t seeing the benefits of high penetration of the COVID contact tracing app in the country . The country has the highest penetration of any automated contact tracing app in the world, which sees about 40% of the population using the Rakning C-19 app. “The technology is more or less … I wouldn’t say useless,” says Gestur Pálmason, a detective inspector with the Icelandic Police Service who is overseeing contact tracing efforts. “But it’s the integration of the two that gives you results. I would say it [Rakning] has proven useful in a few cases, but it wasn’t a game changer for us.”    @media only screen and (max-width:740px) {  .quote-box{font-size:18px; line-height:30px; color:#505050; margin-top:30px; padding:22px 20px 20px 70px; position:relative; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold}  .special-text{font-size:24px; line-height:32px; color:#505050; margin:20px 40px 20px 20px; border-left:8px solid #ee1b24; padding:10px 10px 10px 15px; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold}  .quote-box img{width:60px; left:6px}  .quote-box .quote-nam{font-size:16px; color:#5f5f5f; padding-top:30px; text-align:right; font-weight:normal}  .quote-box .quote-nam span{font-weight:bold; color:#ee1b24}  }"
16,"Mandating use of Aarogya Setu app illegal, says Justice B N Srikrishna","Former Supreme Court Judge Justice B N Srikrishna at Idea Exchange (Express file photo) Former Supreme Court Judge Justice B N Srikrishna at Idea Exchange (Express file photo)  Former Supreme Court Judge B N Srikrishna, who chaired the committee that came out with the first draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill, termed the government’s push mandating the use of Aarogya Setu app “utterly illegal”.  “Under what law do you mandate it on anyone? So far it is not backed by any law,” the former judge told The Indian Express.  On May 1, the Ministry of Home Affairs, in its guidelines after the nationwide lockdown was extended, made Aarogya Setu App mandatory for employees of private and public sector offices. It also asked local authorities to ensure 100% coverage of the app in containment zones. The guidelines were issued by the National Executive Committee set up under the National Disaster Management Act (NDMA), 2005.  The Noida police then said that not having the Aarogya Setu application would be punishable with imprisonment up to six months or fine up to Rs 1,000.  Also Read | Would not have accepted (RS seat)…nobody would offer it to me: Justice Deepak Gupta  “The Noida police order is totally unlawful. I am assuming this is still a democratic country and such orders can be challenged in court,” he said.  Justice Srikrishna said that the guidelines cannot be considered as having sufficient legal backing to make the use of Aarogya Setu mandatory. “These pieces of legislation — both the National Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act — are for a specific reason. The national executive committee in my view is not a statutory body,” he said.  In July 2017, while the Supreme Court was still examining whether the right to privacy would constitute a fundamental right, the government had appointed Justice Srikrishna to head the committee on data protection. The committee of experts and officials held public hearings across the country and submitted a report in July 2018, in which it also proposed a draft data protection law. The Bill is yet to be brought to Parliament for approval. The report recommended that “processing of personal data must only be done for clear, specific and lawful” purposes. The committee recommended several rights for the data principal (whose personal data is collected) – from revoking consent granted for processing data, notifying a breach to having their incorrectly processed data rectified by the authorities.  The Supreme Court in the landmark 2017 ruling that recognised the fundamental right to privacy laid down a three-fold test to examine constitutionality of government actions that could invade a citizen’s right to privacy. The first condition is that the action taken must be under a law duly passed by Parliament and the government will have to show it had a “legitimate state interest” to violate the right to privacy apart from having considered all less intrusive measures before violating the right.  On Monday, the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing protocol was issued, setting up principles for collecting and processing of data. The protocol is an “order” by the Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management set up by the National Executive of the Disaster Management Act.  Justice Srikrishna said that the protocol would not be adequate to protect the data. “It is akin to an inter-departmental circular. It is good that they are keeping with the principles of the Personal Data Protection Bill but who will be responsible if there is a breach? It does not say who should be notified,” he said.  In a webinar organised on Monday by Daksha Fellowship, a legal education group, he called the new protocol a “patchwork” that will “cause more concern to citizens than benefit.”  “It is highly objectionable that such an order is issued at an executive level. Such an order has to be backed by Parliamentary legislation, which will authorise the government to issue such an order,” said Justice Srikrishna.  “If it is traced to NDMA, the NDMA has no provision for constitution of an empowered group. (Under) what provision of law is this order issued? I cannot understand … If there is a breach of data here, who is answerable, what action has to be taken and (who is) accountable for the data breach. This should really have been traced ideally to PDP (Personal Data Protection) or through NDMA by an appropriate amendment,” he said.  — with inputs from Aashish Aryan  📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

18,"Centre must address privacy concerns, and ensure greater transparency on Aarogya Setu","The government claims it has launched this contact tracing app to better equip healthcare authorities to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The government claims it has launched this contact tracing app to better equip healthcare authorities to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)  In 2017, India witnessed a unique event. A democratically-elected government stood before the Supreme Court and argued that it had complete and absolute right over the lives of its citizens. It asserted that privacy was an “elitist” concern, that its surveillance powers had no constitutional limits and, no fundamental right to privacy was guaranteed by the Constitution. The Court disagreed unanimously.  Twice thereafter, the Narendra Modi government attempted to circumvent the Supreme Court’s strictures. First, through the mandatory, expansive and unjustified use of Aadhaar, which was pruned substantially by the Court. And second, by issuing a tender to build a surveillance system in 2018, which was stopped after being brought to the notice of the Supreme Court. The government’s latest attempt at circumventing our fundamental right to privacy is the Aarogya Setu app.  Editorial | App for a reason  The government claims it has launched this contact tracing app to better equip healthcare authorities to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its historically poor track record on privacy, the lack of transparency about who built and runs the app, and the absence of data protection legislation compound people’s anxieties. Especially because the app allows the government continuous access to an individual’s location and demographic data. Thus it is imperative that the government answer some burning questions:  First, since the app breaches the fundamental right to privacy, it must have legislative sanction. Instead, the app is being imposed through executive order. Companies are being told that all their employees must use the app, and local governments, building societies and shops are making it mandatory. Why has the government not complied with the orders of the Supreme Court vis-a-vis the need for legislation? Under what legal framework has this breach of privacy been shown to be reasonable?  Second, what are the safeguards against data theft and other breaches? The app’s Terms of Service (TOS) confer blanket limited liability on the government. In cases of data theft, who will be held accountable? How can the government be allowed to operate a huge surveillance system without concomitant obligations?  Third, why is the app not open source? The closed source architecture of the app violates transparency principles and this government’s own policies. Singapore’s TraceTogether app was made open source, thus allowing researchers and experts to test the architecture and suggest measures to correct vulnerabilities.  Read | Aarogya data only for health needs, to be deleted in 180 days  Fourth, why is there no protocol for deletion of data? What legal rights do users have over their data and its deletion? Does the government have a right to hold the data and process it in perpetuity? Under the TOS, the government is obligated to delete certain personal data after a 30-day time period. However, there exists no framework to check compliance of the same. If users have no control over their data, it is a complete violation of their right to informational self-determination and the right to be forgotten.  Ever-changing rules add to the problem. On April 14, the app updated its privacy policy without notifying users, despite the privacy policy explicitly mandating the same. Such actions do not inspire trust.  Fifth, has the app been tested with any groups of users, for example, like Britain is testing a contact tracing app with a limited population in the Isle of Wight? Has the government conducted scenario analyses of how the app can be misused or abused? This is crucial in India given how much stigmatisation has already occurred (communities refusing to bury bodies of COVID patients and an instance of the lynching of a person suspected to be positive). The human touch may be vital, as Kerala has demonstrated, by successfully using old-fashioned manual contact tracing.  Sixth, has the government figured out how to deal with cases of false positives, the possibility of which is acknowledged in the TOS? How well trained are officials who will be making decisions about whom to quarantine? What if the app provokes people to infer incorrectly that someone they encountered a few days earlier was a carrier of the virus? If they attack or stigmatise that person, a faulty algorithm or inference would have jeopardised someone’s life. How will the government deal with such cases?  Seventh, in a country where the total number of smartphone users is around 500 million, is the government going to penalise the remaining (almost) two-thirds of the population for not downloading the app on a smartphone they do not possess or cannot afford?  Across India, there are efforts to build databases of people’s health records to enable easier treatment, including through telemedicine. If instances of misuse of the Aarogya Setu app emerge, then people will not trust other government initiatives involving health records, even if they are undertaken with due care, inclusive consultations, and respect for privacy.  The government must address these concerns in an open manner. Contradictory statements from ministers and combative rejoinders to those, like Rahul Gandhi, who raised valid concerns, just worsen the confusion.  When the Supreme Court heard the Right to Privacy case, it marked an unprecedented occasion where the government of India actually argued against the rights of its citizens. Now, it is time to stand up and ensure that, through the Aarogya Setu app, this government does not callously snatch those rights and jeopardise citizens’ safety.

19,Securing the Aarogya Setu app,"editorials  Updated: May 10, 2020 20:10 IST  The Aarogya Setu application was born out of a need to bring a 21st century technology-based solution to an unprecedented problem. India is not alone in deciding to leverage the ubiquitous smartphone for tracking outbreaks, a strategy that fundamentally involves a compromise with privacy. But it is the only democracy which has, without the requisite legal architecture in place, made the app almost mandatory for mobility and to resume work. This compromise is evidence of how the Sars-Cov-2 has upended conventional disease containment efforts, with a higher degree of government supervision, and even control, over the lives of citizens than usual. But it is crucial that this necessity does not lead to a lasting change in how we approach privacy. By design, the app goes a step further than most such tools developed around the world. It tracks where people have been, instead of merely determining who they were in close contact with. While such functionality can theoretically help identify disease hotspots, it will need to be corroborated with the exactness of physical contact tracing.  The other concern stems from the nature of computer programmes. They are prone to vulnerabilities, particularly in early iterations. This was proved by a French programmer who demonstrated the possibility of accessing parts of the Aarogya Setu app that store a person’s contact records. Common cybersecurity and hacking techniques have proven capable of reverse engineering such data to dig out information that was meant to be hidden. What the researcher demonstrated was the penultimate step before someone can be traced without the need to break into a government database. An increasing number of countries are discovering flaws — in design or code — and are going back to the drawing board. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service is considering abandoning its version of a centralised contact-tracing app, where data is sent to government servers, to switch to the decentralised platform being developed by Apple and Google, where data is matched on phones.  As the approaches around such tools evolve, India must look at the experiences and experiments in other countries. One of the main demands by privacy as well as cyber security experts around the world is to throw open the code behind these contact-tracing applications so that they can be audited for design and programming flaws. At the very least, the developers of Aarogya Setu must consider doing this, since it will not only be a step toward transparency but also help quash bugs. After all, the current gold standard of such tools, Singapore’s Trace Together, is an open-source programme. Beyond this, India must seriously contemplate a legal design around the app, which strikes a balance between disease containment and privacy."

The states continued to record over 3,500 fresh coronavirus cases even on Monday. The total number of coronavirus cases in India jumped to 70,756, according to ministry of health and family welfare. Maharashtra added over 1,000 new cases for the sixth straight day.  The number of COVID-19 related deaths rose to 2,293 as 87 people passed away in last 24 hours. Maharashtra confirmed 36 deaths on Monday, taking the total death toll in the state to 868.  The total number of active coronavirus patients in India increased to 46,008.

25,Back on the rails,"Getting passenger trains back on track is an apt follow-up to the graded easing of the lockdown announced on May 1. Getting passenger trains back on track is an apt follow-up to the graded easing of the lockdown announced on May 1.  Less than two weeks after starting special services for migrant workers stranded in different parts of the country to go back home, the Indian Railways has announced that it will resume passenger trains between Delhi and 15 other cities. The trains will have only AC coaches, the fare will be equivalent to what is charged for a Rajdhani Express journey, bookings will be made online. By focusing on premium services, the Railways seem to be targeting a small fraction of the about 20 million passengers who rely on rail transport every day under normal circumstances. At the same time, the national transporter has indicated that it is open to starting more “special trains”. For an economy that has come to a grinding halt after the seven-week lock lockdown, these are much-awaited signals. Getting passenger trains back on track is an apt follow-up to the graded easing of the lockdown announced on May 1.  The Railways have clarified that passengers will need to wear masks and undergo screening at the station. But given that asymptomatic people constitute a large part of the COVID-19 transmission chain, the Railways and state governments will have to remain alert, exercise utmost caution. They will have to be vigilant about passengers observing social distancing protocols at the railway stations and during the journey. The importance of these measures cannot be overstated because the trains will ply between some of the COVID-19 hotspots — Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata.  Increasingly, scientists, epidemiologists and policymakers in several parts of the world are coming around to a consensus that the coronavirus is here to stay, and nations will have to find ways to live with the pathogen. There is also a growing realisation that societies cannot be in perpetual lockdown — experts have consistently stressed that stringent lockdowns do not frame the endgame against the pandemic. This means that the stay-at-home approach, emphasised during the past seven weeks in the country, must now give way to policies that provide room for people’s mobility — albeit cautiously, and taking care to obviate any escalation of the outbreak. It is welcome, therefore, that the resumption of transport appears to be on the agenda of other ministries as well. Last week, the Union Minister for Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs, Nitin Gadkari, indicated that the government is formulating guidelines for social distancing with a view to resuming public transport. The civil aviation ministry must also find ways to resume airline services. The challenges of ensuring social distancing at airports and inside aircraft are, of course, very different from those of enforcing such measures in metros, buses, and trains. Yet the primary goal of the ministries that deal with transport should now be to ensure that society moves to a semblance of normalcy, while ensuring people’s safety.  📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

27,ExplainSpeaking: Are Indian labour laws as inflexible (or pro-worker) as is often claimed?,"In the days and weeks ahead, we could see the impact of the summary suspension of labour laws on both job creation and labour welfare. (Express photo: Arul Horizon) In the days and weeks ahead, we could see the impact of the summary suspension of labour laws on both job creation and labour welfare. (Express photo: Arul Horizon)  Dear Readers,  Last week, three BJP-ruled states announced sweeping changes to the application of labour laws in a bid to kickstart the economy. Some other, non-BJP, states also tweaked labour laws, but those changes were not as big as the ones that Uttar Pradesh in particular unleashed.  These state governments argue that without being constrained by laws of any kind — minimum wages, dispute resolution, health compensations etc. — Indian firms will roar back to health and finally achieve their potential of being world-beaters.  But some questions arise. One, the changes appeared rushed. Take, for example, the UP ordinance which exempted “factories and other manufacturing establishments [from the] application of certain labour laws for a period three years”.  The use of the word “certain” was odd — nowhere did the ordinance state which specific laws were being suspended. Nowhere in the ordinance for example, was there a mention of firms being required, by law, to pay “minimum” wages to workers.  In the days and weeks ahead, we could see the impact of the summary suspension of labour laws on both job creation and labour welfare (wages, exploitation, rights etc.). In that sense, what we are likely to witness is a massive not-so-randomised control trial to test whether (and to what extent) India’s labour laws have been holding back its growth.  Radhicka Kapoor, Senior Fellow at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, says this notion of “inflexibility” is misplaced. She points to a 2019 paper by Aditya Bhattacharjea, Professor at the Delhi School of Economics, that traces the origins (and the dodgy journey, as it turns out) of the notion that Indian labour laws are “inflexible”.  The story starts in 2004 when Timothy Besley and Robin Burgess created an index to measure the regulatory variations across Indian states. “This measure,” Bhattacharjea says, “was based on state-level amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), which is just one out of dozens of Indian labour laws”.  He then goes on to explain the technicalities (read ‘multiple inaccuracies’) of this index as well as the incorrect (read ‘blind’) manner in which this index was repeatedly used by researchers over the years to reinforce the point that Indian labour laws were “inflexible” — “which has distorted the policy implications of their research findings”.  Bhattacharjea concludes: “As in the children’s game of Chinese Whispers, later researchers successively distorted their predecessors’ interpretation of the index, so that eventually it came to be characterised as a measure of the degree of legally-mandated job security, which it was not supposed to be.”  Perhaps our policymakers should get greater clarity on the flexibility or the lack of it in Indian labour laws — after all, this is the fundamental premise on which the labourers of the some of the most populous states are being subjected to work under norms that were considered exploitative even when we were ruled by the British.

28,"Karnataka to join new labour league, to amend labour laws to bail out industrial sector","BENGALURU: Karnataka is set to amend labour laws to bail out the industrial sector in the wake of the lockdown forced by Covid-19, joining Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat which quickly responded to calls for easing of regulations.Chief minister BS Yediyurappa is expected to sign off on a set of amendments to a few labour laws and regulations in a day. They will later come before the cabinet for a post-facto approval.The proposed amendments are expected to make life easier for large, medium, and small industries that are struggling with serious cash flow issues following seven weeks of lockdown.The government will amend Factories Act, Industrial Disputes Act and Contract Labour Act, among others. The provisions of amended Factories Act will apply to units employing 40 or more persons while the Industrial Disputes Act will apply to units with 300 or more workers, up from 100 or more workers at present. Following the amendment, the cap of employees under the Contract Labour Act will go up to 50 from 20.One of the amendments will also increase the cap on overtime in factories to 100 hours per quarter from 75 hours.“We will not do anything that will go against the interests of labourers. These are measures we have proposed for the time being to tide over the challenges thrown at us by Covid-19 pandemic. The government will review them once the crisis is over,” labour and sugar minister Shivaram Hebbar told ET. “Since the new Covid-19 protocol requires industrial units and offices to have only 33% of attendance at a time, we want them to introduce shifts and make up for the loss of productivity.”As labour falls in the concurrent list of the Constitution, the state will prepare a set of ordinances and send them to the Centre for presidential assent. The government will place regular amendment bills once the legislature session begins.Several states acted swiftly after the Uttar Pradesh government, in a bold decision, notified an ordinance exempting all establishments, factories, and businesses from the purview of most of its labour laws for three years.The amendments proposed will go a long way in helping a large number of industrial units, and make Karnataka even more attractive for investments, said Gaurav Gupta, principal secretary, industries.Investors have for long been calling for simplification of India’s labour laws as they have to navigate both central and state laws and regulations. India had 45 central labour legislations and about 200 labour laws at the level of states, till the Centre streamlined the central laws into labour codes."
29,"UP, MP ease labour laws: India needs to ride this wave focussing on employee health, safety and correct 'miserable' record in this matter","The Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat state governments have relaxed labour laws in a bid to attract investment and restart economic activity that was paralysed by the nationwide coronavirus-induced lockdown. Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat have also amended their Factories Acts and increased the work hours from 8 to 12 hours a day or 72 hours per week.  The industry is divided over the new rules. The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises who spoke with Firstpost chose to focus on the challenges they face as the government has begun lockdown relaxations and allowed certain industries to function.  Entrepreneurs said paying salaries, as mandated by the government when there was no production; getting back the workers who have left for their home towns; sanitising factories and workplaces besides getting raw materials and supply chain in place—these are among the various huge challenges for the sector, they said.  Industry points to challenges, need for ease of labour laws  “The new rules are tough, but are needed as these are extraordinary circumstances,"" said Mahesh Singhi, founder, home-grown merger and advisory firm, Singhi Advisors. He terms the three state governments rules easing labour laws as ‘a right step at the right time’. Singhi said if more rules were formulated even as others were made redundant, it would hamper each state’s plan to resume economic activity.  “Rules and laws are alright for normal times. But this is a war-like situation and the primary aim is to generate employment, create a demand for the products and services and narrow the demand-supply gap,” he said. But should it come at the cost of worker’s health, their rights? Singhi said that any revolution calls for changes in rules. “You have a right to earn and that comes from a responsibility to work.” But would that mean stretching work hours to 12 instead of the ILO mandated 8 hours? “The need of the hour is to ensure there is money flow in the system. Both the employer and employees need to go through some tough times before things ease back to normalcy,” he said.  The work hours established in the ILO convention are 48 hours per week. Labour regulations such as 8 hour workdays were brought in after years of protests against exploitation. But, labour is a concurrent subject and states can amend certain labour laws for their regions.  Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, Confederation of Indian Industries said in a statement: “The labour changes initiated in UP and MP, are both steps that will give huge flexibility to industry in their labour practices.”  With a huge number of employees having left their workplaces due to coronavirus and lockdown measures, there is a need to reskill and map workers who have been displaced and re-employ them as per the needs of the industry, Banerjee said. The ordinance in UP and relaxations in norms in MP will help industry to adapt and rise to new economic realities swiftly, he said.  The other recourse is for government to pitch in with a relief package. Arjit Rawal, Director, Logistech India Private Ltd, suggested the government follow what the Canadian government is doing for industries. The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy encourages employers to recruit workers who lost their jobs due to the coronavirus. The CEWS offers a subsidy of 75 percent of an eligible employee’s weekly earnings, to a maximum of $847 per employee per week to eligible employers, for up to 12 weeks. The funding is retroactive to 15 March.  Rawal wants the government to ease the pressure on employers by giving them some reliefs. “Consider extending the financial year,” he suggested. The industry has been demanding extension of fiscal year by three months in view of the economic impact caused by outbreak of COVID-19. But says Rawal, “Companies still have to file annual income tax returns. Where will the entrepreneur who does minuscule business be able to do this in these circumstances?” he asked.  Labour has migrated in huge numbers back to their villages and home towns, and to get them back will be a huge task, he said. “The government should offer a holistic solution and incentivise industry till it comes to a normal curve,” Rawal said.  The entire efforts of the government and the hardships borne by people for a 40-day lockdown has been somehow diluted by the talk on labour laws, absence of labour as they have migrated to their villages, said Siddharth Shenoy, president, Bombay Industries Association. He said the MSME sector is faced with challenges—no transportation, disruption of supply chains, shortage of labour, among others. “The large companies can take care of themselves as they have a lot of subsidiaries. But what about us,” he asked.  Some believe the relaxation of labour laws are temporary as stated by the state governments. Conceding that labour is a very essential part of the ecosystem, Ashok Mohanani, Chairman Ekta World, Vice President, NAREDCO, said the laws are being relaxed as an emergency measure to give a much-needed boost to the economy. Availability of land, flexibility in labour laws and a welcoming administration will be attractive to global markets looking to rationalise supply chains. ""However, it is also essential to ensure that the labour is not exploited and this is a positive move for them as well along with the businesses,"" he said.  Some industrial associations see the lockdown relaxations as the most crucial period. It is almost a COVID-19 Part 2 situation, said KR Gopi, president, TMIA-The TTC-MIDC Industries Association. With a significant percentage of labour in Maharashtra hailing from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the TMIA now fears that the workers may prefer to stay back in their home states.  “With a large base, second only to China, the MSME sector contributes over 28 percent of the GDP and more than 40 percent of India's exports, while creating employment for about 11 crore. The sector is called the backbone of the economy, but the government ignores the sector when it comes to stimulus packages,” Gopi said. “We have to pay wages for month of April and May during the lockdown when there was zero production. There is no relief on electricity bill payments, interest on loans taken for working capital.""  He said labour laws can be relaxed temporarily but these cannot be made permanent and are best short-term solutions. The safety and health of workers have to be taken care of and it cannot be an either/or option, Gopi said.  On Monday, Nitin Gadkari, the Minister for MSME, and Road Transport and Highways said he expects the Centre to unveil a financial package in two-three days, observing that the situation ""was very bad"" despite the three-month moratorium on loan repayments announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  But some are unconvinced of these packages percolating to the ones who need it. “The government announces reliefs—bank loans for the MSME sector, for instance, but the banks are loathe to give it. Rules are made and passed by the Centre but nothing takes off on the ground level,” said Siddharth Shenoy, President, Bombay Industries Association.  Whither workers rights?  In the frenzy to get investments and the economy going, the State governments have over-stepped on labour laws that have been painstakingly fought and mandated for the health and safety of workers. KR Shyam Sundar, labour economist and professor in Human Resource Management (HRM) Area, XLRI, Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur said it is unfathomable how a State Government can amend labour laws justifying labour shortages and the need to kickstart the economy. He termed this as ‘labour market anarchy’.  He said, these labour law changes are based on three key principles, viz., labour laws are not needed in the society which means no role for the State in the labour market; workers should solely rely on the goodwill of the employer, and labour rigidities are the principal irritants that halt investment and hence economic growth. He fears the UP Model ‘will probably’ become the defining labour market governance norm.  Concurring with Sundar, Rama Kiran, assistant professor and head of the department of commerce, SK Somaiya College, Mumbai and a research scholar said the changes brought about in labour laws are a ‘slap in the faces of workers who were forced to walk home hungry’. Kiran has worked extensively on female labour working in garment factories. “Around 90 percent of workers in garment factories are women. By relaxing labour rules and not providing them basic amenities like toilet facilities, canteen, drinking water, what is the management offering them? You want them to work for 12 hours, but you don’t want to provide them with amenities,” she asked.  Are the state government's action in sync with human rights and labour rights laws? But the goal is to kickstart the economy and in the present time, any action that meets with it is par for the course.  Maansi Parpiani, a researcher with Aavjeevika Bureau, a non-profit working with migrant labour in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, said terms like organized labour and migrant labour is a false binary. “Only a very small fraction of workers have full rights in organisations. Many semi-permanent workers are employed in big industrial sectors, and MSMEs on short-term contracts.” Parpiani said, contract labour has already diluted existing laws and limited the number of workers they actually protect.  The state governments by their latest move has, with its stated focus, brushed away labour's rights. It is time then for the government to step in before the remaining States take this route. Vishal Kumar, co-founder and Financial Advisor, MSMEx-an online micro advisory platform for small business owners, said labour reforms have been long-pending and much-needed for a densely populated country like India. The Uttar Pradesh government's striking down labour laws is a two-pronged decision, he said: ""From a business angle, it would be welcome with easing of norms and compliances. But India cannot be seen as a country that exploits its labour, especially when health is the big challenge in these times,"" he said.  Do labour laws in India need amendments? Most of the peeople who spoke with Firstpost said, it was unnecesary. They said the BJP-ruled states have passed rules. ""The BJP central government may support state governments that pass these rules,"" said advocate Saju Jakob, practising in Supreme Court and High Court, Delhi. He termed the easing of labour laws ‘misguided’ and a new low. “Capital will only flow where labour standards are good. Investment does not depend on cheap labour and potential investors will look at infrastructure. The focus should be on that,” he said.  The easing of labour laws has thrown open the proverbial Pandora's Box for the labour in the country. They may have to trudge a long road before they can take back what they had until the rules were reversed.  However, all is not lost, said Gayathri Vasudevan,Executive Chairperson and Co-Founder, LabourNet Services. When the dice is cast against the favour of labour, it is better to focus on what can be prised away for the benefit of labour insted.  Gayathri said, the losses to industry due to the pandemic is 'massive' with resultant job losses, according to news reports. In the circumstances, she suggested it would be better for activists and others who fought for rights and protection of labour to ride this wave by focussing on employee health, safety and protection given that India has a 'miserable' record in this matter. A win-win proposition, perhaps, given that labour shortage would imply they have to be compensated, if not immediately but in the long-run. That could be a happy outcome of the amendment of labour laws. Perhaps."
30,Opinion | Labour law reform experiments that could show us a path ahead,"It is fascinating to see the reactions to a slew of seemingly radical reforms that a few state governments have announced. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have announced relaxations in the application of many labour laws for businesses over the next three years. A newspaper that did not put these announcements on its front page took care to put the response of labour unions on that page. Several editorials have cautioned against diluting protection measures for labour. It has always been hard to experiment with reforms in India. Critics, however, seem appear unwilling to see many of these as policy experiments that can be tweaked based on experience and evidence. Nor do they seem ready to ask counterfactual questions. They also appear to lack an appreciation of the context.  India had a relatively disappointing last decade in terms of standard economic parameters: economic growth and employment rates. The decade of the 2020s has begun on an even more ominous note. There is an overhang of financial-sector problems, a legacy that originated in the previous decade. Household saving rates have declined and capital formation in industry is languishing. Employment generation is too weak to generate hope and fulfil aspirations of our youth demographic bulge. The risk of another lost decade is non-trivial. India’s factor markets have long eluded reforms. Bold thinking is what’s needed now.  The National Democratic Alliance government that took office in 2014 attempted to improve the onerous and impractical Land Acquisition Act of 2013, but gave up in the face of political resistance from within and without. Similarly, it had the right intentions on labour reforms, but had to confine itself to token measures. An all-party consensus would have served India well and would serve us well even now. But that is a tough ask, as it takes two hands to clap. Therefore, the only option left to the government is to use perceptions of a serious economic crisis to undertake far-reaching reforms and then observe how they play out. This is not very different from what reformers did in 1991.  Most of the reforms that need to happen, barring financial sector reforms, are the responsibility of states. Whether it is electricity generation or distribution, water distribution and pricing, reforms of school education to improve outcomes, or labour and land reforms, all of these are substantially in the hands of state governments. In such a situation, if some states take seemingly radical measures and other states do not, it actually provides a good setting for a controlled experiment. It will give rise to a rich body of evidence that can be deployed to improve policies in the same states, or elsewhere.  We had comprehensive protection for organized-sector workers in our statute books all these years. What is their record? India has one of the world’s highest proportion of informal workers. Commentators question the record of Chapter VB of the Industrial Disputes Act, which applies to industrial establishments employing not less than 100 workmen, in holding back job creation. In other words, with the bulk of India’s establishments employing less than 100 workers, the implicit message is that this ceiling did not act as a binding constraint.  Two responses come to mind. One is that the impact of policy is often asymmetric. Indeed, that is the default effect. The repeal of the said provision may not immediately lead to employment generation because other hurdles remain, but its existence would surely retard job creation. That is what asymmetry is all about. That calls for a comprehensive approach to labour law reforms, instead of a piecemeal one.  The second question to ask is whether rigorous empirical evidence is demanded of other policy changes. India enacted a law on land acquisition in 2013. What is its record? Has it facilitated land sales at better prices, or has it dampened transactions? If it was meant to improve the lot of farmers, then why did so many farm loan waivers have to be given, and why do so many farmer suicides continue to take place? Of course, many other variables impinge on their condition. That is precisely the point with respect to the amendment of the relevant section of the Industrial Disputes Act. It is possible that a weak State compensates for poor execution with stringent rules on the book. It is sensible to have fewer laws and implement them more effectively.  The law of unintended consequences has blighted India’s many seemingly well-intentioned policy decisions in favour of the poor, the marginalized, and micro and small businesses. These have been condemned to the status quo. Not so long ago, the leader of a leading labour union said that companies which earlier needed 100 workers could now operate with just 20 to 30 due to mechanisation; and hence, the Chapter VB threshold should be lowered.  Intelligent Indians should worry about such attitudes and logical absurdities, rather than wailing over the recent reform measures adopted by a few states. We can hold their feet to the fire when needed, but we would do well to cheer them too. Otherwise, the quality of governance would be as sloppy as the criticism levelled against it.

31,Ordinances by states to change labour laws are a travesty,"Basic necessities like environmental protection, worker safety, hazardous industrial activity, basic rights, require regulation. (Express File Photo by Gajendra Yadav) Basic necessities like environmental protection, worker safety, hazardous industrial activity, basic rights, require regulation. (Express File Photo by Gajendra Yadav)  Indian labour laws needed serious reform. But the ordinances being promulgated by state governments are, under the pretext of reform, unleashing a whole-scale assault on labour. By increasing working hours, the state wants to literally break their bodies, their freedom and their dignity. By taking away any serious pretence of grievance redressal, the state wants to immobilise all questions of justice. States want to ensure that labour has no bargaining power left.  Indian labour laws had the unique distinction of representing the state’s war on both capital and labour. They were irrelevant to 90 per cent of India’s labour force. At best, and very rarely, they protected a small section of it. They created enough distortions to prevent greater formal protections for the labour force. The work of KR Shyam Sundar showed in great detail that these laws were, in his phrase, “not even a paper tiger.”  Editorial | Reform for labour  It is a myth that India’s labour laws increased Indian labour’s bargaining power. As brilliant papers by Aditya Bhattacharjea of Delhi School of Economics showed, Indian labour’s wages stagnated, since the 1980s there was a massive decrease in strikes and lockouts, factories with hundred or more workers experienced more variability in employment than smaller firms. So the idea that Indian labour’s bargaining power was an obstacle to India’s industrialisation is errant nonsense.  Labour law did not protect workers. It was not incompatible with growth. But these propositions are not incompatible with the idea that labour laws can still sometimes unfairly hurt business. These laws were excessively complex. Some laws created rigidities that had nothing to do with labour protection. They disincentivised industry investment in human capital. They created a political economy of rent-seeking. Business has often circumvented these laws. But the very need for circumvention can distort the nature of entrepreneurship and adversely select those who can manage the state, more than genuinely innovative entrepreneurs.  Opinion | Migrant Workmen Act, 1979, must be rationalised to remove requirements that disincentivise formalisation  So the Narendra Modi government was right in thinking that these laws needed to be looked at afresh. The Industrial Relations Code was introduced in the Lok Sabha in November 2019. The Standing Committee has just given its report. This was a sensible way to proceed: It allowed room for serious deliberation on first principles, it allowed parliament to take an all-things-considered view of the matter, and would have, if done right, created a labour code fit for the 21st century.  But, instead, we have a four-pronged assault on labour that threatens to undermine the Modi government’s own legislation. The first is an assault on constitutionalism. Previous governments have abused the ordinance route. But the brazen use of ordinance to suspend such important provisions of the law, when Parliament is already deliberating on the matter, shows contempt for democracy. Allowing the states to override central legislation, without justification, will create future problems for federalism. Repealing many of these provisions will put India in contravention of ILO conventions and its own laws. And there is also a non-application of mind in many of the proposals. Some states will increase work hours without increasing rate of compensation. Let us say we do want more flexibility in working hours that allow occasionally for 12-hour shifts. What is the objective of flexibility? If it is workers’ health and reducing commutes, should such flexibility not still be within a limit of the total number of working hours in the week? Or do we want to barbarically increase the total number of working hours? On constitutionality, democratic propriety, application of mind, the president has a good basis for withholding assent. These ordinances confirm the worst fears that the pandemic emergency will be used to amass arbitrary powers at a time when it is not even possible to protest.  Second, we are seeing a systematic assault on whatever little bargaining power labour has left. We inflict needless duress, indignity and the spectre of poverty on millions of workers by refusing to provide adequate social support. We artificially create a mass army of reserve labour, barely on the brink of subsistence, so they have no option but to work on any terms that are offered. If the government is genuinely worried about what to do with labour who might not want to return to work because both the state and their employers have treated them atrociously, it can easily expand the remit of MGNREGA. But here is the dirty secret for why governments and employers hate the MGNREGA. Its real effect is that it puts a floor under labour, and marginally improves its bargaining position.  The third is an ideological assault on Indian labour. The narrative build-up has been that India’s inability to attract companies leaving China has largely to do with labour. Indian labour’s capacity to supposedly obstruct the onward march of Indian capitalism pales in comparison with the state and Indian capital’s capacity to inflict damage on the Indian economy. The fourth is the cultivation of an authoritarianism: The more we can punish our own people the more salvation there will be for us. The ease with which we applaud 12-hour working days, the machismo with which we applaud the gutting of grievance redressal, suggests a deeper pathology that might have nothing to do with economics.  Basic necessities like environmental protection, worker safety, hazardous industrial activity, basic rights, require regulation. We have to invest in the state capacity to do them right. We need to reclaim the word reform. “Reform” should be used only when a particular measure actually achieves a desired objective. Gutting environmental laws is not “reform.” Designing laws and enforcement that achieve clean air and water is reform. Gutting labour protection is not “reform.” Designing protection that can protect core interests of workers, respect their bargaining power and at the same time rescue distortions in capital allocation, is reform. What our chief ministers are doing is not reform: It is indolence and authoritarianism masquerading as reform.  The Industrial Relations Code was a good beginning by the Modi government. The ordinances are a travesty. No country can develop that does not invest in human capital of its citizens, that does not increase the share of labour in the country’s wealth, and does not get the balance between capital and labour right. The Modi government can decide whether it wants to write a new and fairer social contract. Or will it unleash a new 19th century barbarism?

38,"Air India staffer tests positive for Covid-19, office sealed for two days","india  Updated: May 12, 2020 12:12 IST  The office of national carrier Air India was sealed in Delhi on Tuesday after one of the staff members tested positive for coronavirus disease Covid-19.  “Airlines House has been sealed for Tuesday and Wednesday,” news agency PTI quoted an official as saying.  The official said that the employee was diagnosed with Covid-19 on May 7, through the RT-PCR test, and tested positive on Monday evening.  The employee first had fever which subsided with the help of medicines but then the staffer started having soar throat and respiratory symptoms. He got himself tested on Sunday and was sent to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital in Delhi after it.  “However, the doctors at RML prescribed him medicines and advised him to watch for any change of condition and recommended home quarantine,” the official said.  Five Air India pilots had earlier tested positive for Covid-19. But in the second round of testing, their results came negative.  The results of second round of tests came on Monday evening.  The Mumbai-based pilots had operated cargo flights to China before April 20 and had been in home isolation for 14 days.  However, two other employees - a technician and a tug driver - of an Air India subsidiary again tested positive. “The airline is in touch with the employees,” said an official.  As part of the government’s ‘Vande Bharat’ mission to repatriate stranded Indian nationals from different countries during the Covid-19 lockdown, Air India would operate 64 flights between May 7 and May 14.

41,Air India Delhi Office Shut For 2 Days As Staff Tests Positive For Coronavirus,"The man who tested positive for COVID-19 is in home quarantine. (File)  The Air India headquarters in Delhi has been shut for two days after a peon tested positive for coronavirus. Everyone, including the Chairman and Managing Director Pradeep Singh Kharola, will work from home, the national carrier said on Tuesday.  The office is being sanitised. There are up to 200 people, including visitors, in the building at any given time, according to officials.  ""As Air India accords top priority to the safety and well-being of its employees, the building will be closed for sanitisation adhering to protocol. All support is being extended to the employee concerned,"" the airline said in a statement.  The man who tested positive for COVID-19 is in home quarantine.  Yesterday, five Air India pilots believed to have coronavirus tested negative. All Boeing 787 Dreamliner pilots, they had reportedly had false-positive results because of faulty test kits. Re-tests had been carried out on priority because of suspicion that the results may not be accurate.  A technician and a driver have also tested positive. It is unclear at the moment whether the two will be re-tested. Both remain in quarantine.  The five pilots tested false positive after 77 pilots of the state-run airline were tested for the virus on Saturday before they could operate any repatriation flights. None of the five pilots, all based in Mumbai, had any symptoms and were advised home quarantine.  The last time any of them operated a flight was on April 20.  NDTV has learned that these five pilots stood together in queue for their RT-PCR test. It is believed that the batch of RT-PCR kits they were tested with may have been problematic.

42,"Domestic Flights Resumption News: Government suggests no cabin baggage, detailed questionnaire for passengers","(Representative image)  More on Covid-19  MUMBAI: Filling up of a detailed questionnaire related to COVID-19, carrying no cabin baggage, using Aarogya Setu app and reaching airport at least two hours before a flight departure might well be among the requirements for air passengers during the initial phase after resumption of commercial flights.The civil aviation ministry has come out with a draft standard operating procedure (SOP) for restarting commercial air passenger services in the country, which remain suspended since March 25 in the wake of the lockdown to curb spreading of coronavirus infections.Green status on Aarogya Setu app, web check-in, and temperature checks for all domestic departing and arriving passengers have also been proposed.Coronavirus outbreak: Live updatesThe draft SOP, accessed by PTI, has also mooted rostering the same set of cabin and cockpit crew as long as possible in order to prevent possible cross contamination.Not just for passengers, the draft SOP has suggested measures that could be followed by security agencies as well as airport operators, including doing away with identity card checks at airport entry gates and ensuring social distancing requirements.Another suggestion is to keep three rows of an aircraft vacant for isolating any passenger who has a medical emergency onboard.The draft SOP was prepared after discussions with stakeholders, including airlines and airport operators. Comments have been sought from the stakeholders on it, according to sources.Notably, the draft document is silent on leaving the middle seat of the aircraft vacant for maintaining social distancing. Aviation regulator DGCA had made a suggestion about leaving middle seat vacant, prior to suspension of commercial flight services in March.""A questionnaire to be circulated to the passenger and filled up by them in advance about their past history related to COVID-19 and quarantine, if any, in last one month.""Any passenger who has undergone quarantine in the last one month to be sent for security at the isolated security check unit only,"" as per the document.According to the document, passengers should be advised to familiarise themselves about the new procedures at the airport, especially about social distancing norms and ensuring minimum touching of various surfaces.They should also be familiar with baggage limitations, COVID-19 questionnaire, need to register on Aarogya Setu app, possibly slower processes at airports and use of authorised taxis to reach airport, it said.The ministry has proposed that passengers should reach the airport at least two hours before a flight and do away with passenger identity checks at airport entry gates to minimise rush at the entry points.Passengers can do web check–in and carrying cabin baggage should not be allowed in the initial phase of operations, as per the document.Further, the ministry has suggested that passengers denied travel due to high temperature or age should be permitted to change their date of travel without penalty and airlines would have to maintain their records.Airports should have an isolation zone in the terminal building as well as the airside for passengers showing symptoms and state governments should provide requisite help with medical infrastructure in case an airport does not have an APHO (Airport Health Organisation) set-up, it noted.Airports would have to put in place distance markings, disinfecting all common areas like lifts, escalators, chairs in seating areas, food and beverages, and retail outlets. Availability of moveable hand wash cart or alcohol-based hand sanitisers within the terminal should be ensured, the ministry has proposed.In Video: Post lockdown flights: No cabin baggage, detailed questionnaire for passengers"
43,"No cabin luggage, those over 80 not allowed in draft SOP for domestic flights","india  Updated: May 12, 2020 17:03 IST  Cabin luggage will be barred and passengers aged above 80 years not allowed on flights when air passengers services, suspended since March 25 because of the Covid-19 lockdown, resume in the country, according to guidelines drafted by the government for the first phase of the restart of commercial flights.  The draft standard operating procedures (SOPs) proposed by the civil aviation ministry for passengers, airlines and airport operators at a meeting on Monday have done away with the rule of keeping the middle seats vacant in compliance with social distancing norms. Passenger ID checks will also be not required so as to minimise the crowd at terminal gates.  Stakeholders in the aviation business,including airlines and airport operators, have been asked to review the draft, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, and submit their feedback by the weekend.  Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage  The rules make it compulsory for all passengers to arrive at the airport only after completing their web check-in at home. The reporting time for travellers at the airport is proposed to be increased by two hours. Only passengers whose flights are scheduled to depart in the next six hours will be allowed inside the airports.  Cabin luggage will be disallowed, and only one piece of check-in baggage weighing less than 20kg will be allowed per passenger in the first phase of resumed airline operations.Those aged above 80 will not be allowed on flights. According to the draft SOPs, passengers stopped from boarding a flight because of age or if they are found to be running a high temperature will be permitted to change their travel date without any penalty.  Downloading the Aarogya Setu app will be mandatory for all the passengers. Only those with a “green status” will be allowed to enter the airport.  Airlines have been asked to open check-in counters three hours prior to departure time and close them 60 to 75 minutes prior to departure. Boarding will commence an hour prior to departure time and the gates will close 20 minutes before.  Frisking of passengers has been asked to be minimised and to be carried out only if the door frame metal detector beeps. The draft SOPs also ask the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to not stamp passenger’s boarding pass in this phase.  The airlines have been told to conduct a secondary temperature check at the boarding gate before the passengers enter their flight.  The document also suggests that the same set of crew (pilots and cabin attendants) be rostered on a flight as long as possible to minimise the risk of infection.  Passengers will not be served meals on board. Water will be available in cups and bottles in the galley.

The Civil Aviation Ministry has come out with a draft Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for restarting commercial passenger services in the country, which remain suspended since March 25 in the wake of the lockdown to curb spreading of coronavirus infections.  Green status on Aarogya Setu app, web check-in, and temperature checks for all domestic-, departing- and arriving passengers have also been proposed.

Not just for passengers, the draft SOP has suggested measures that could be followed by security agencies as well as airport operators, including doing away with identity card checks at airport entry gates and ensuring social-distancing norms.  Another suggestion is to keep three rows of an aircraft vacant for isolating any passenger who has a medical emergency onboard.  The draft SOP was prepared after discussions with stakeholders, including airlines and airport operators. Comments have been sought from the stakeholders on it, according to sources.

According to the document, passengers should be advised to familiarise themselves about the new procedures at the airport, especially about social-distancing norms and ensuring minimum touching of various surfaces.  They should also be familiar with baggage limitations, COVID-19 questionnaire, need to register on Aarogya Setu app, possibly slower processes at airports and use of authorised taxis to reach airport, it said.  The Ministry has proposed that passengers should reach the airport at least two hours before the flight and do away with passenger identity checks at airport entry gates to minimise rush at the entry points.  Passengers can do web check-in and carrying cabin baggage should not be allowed in the initial phase of operations, as per the document.  Further, the Ministry has suggested that passengers denied travel due to high temperature or age should be permitted to change their date of travel without penalty and airlines would have to maintain their records.  Airports should have an isolation zone in the terminal building as well as the airside for passengers showing symptoms and State governments should provide requisite help with medical infrastructure in case an airport does not have an APHO (Airport Health Organisation) set-up, it noted.

Hours before Putin made televised remarks Monday about ending the country's partial economic lockdown, health officials reported a daily record of over 11,600 new cases.  Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin revealed on April 30 that he had tested positive for the virus and planned to self-isolate. Putin asked the prime minister to call him after checking into a hospital."

""I am ill. I'm being treated,"" Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies TASS and Interfax, which specified he had COVID-19.  Dmitry Peskov is the fourth senior government official to have fallen ill, after Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Culture Minister Olga Lyubimova and Construction Minister Vladimir Yakushev said they tested positive for the coronavirus.  None were reported to be in a serious condition, with only Mishustin in hospital who was still holding some meetings by video link.  Peskov told TASS news agency that he was last in direct contact with Putin ""over a month ago.""  The Russian leader has been staying at his residence outside Moscow for several weeks and is carrying out meetings and speeches via video link.  Peskov, 52, has served as Putin's spokesman since 2000. He has not held his usual daily telephone briefings with reporters since May 6.  Putin on Monday announced that a strict national lockdown would be eased starting Tuesday, even though the country's rate of new infections shows no sign of slowing.  Russia reported 10,899 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday and a total of 232,243 infections. The country has the world's second highest number of infections, according to an AFP tally.

Health officials have recorded a total of 2,21,344 infections and 2,009 deaths.  Mr. Putin said that Russia had used the self-isolation period to prepare its healthcare system, increasing the number of hospital beds and saving “many thousands of lives.” This “allows us to begin a gradual lifting of restrictions,” he said. “It is in the interest of all of us for the economy to return to normal quickly.” Construction, agriculture and energy should be restarted first, he added. “The epidemic and associated restrictions have had a strong impact on the economy and hurt millions of our citizens,” he said. As people begin going back to work, mass events are still suspended and “strict sanitation demands” must be observed, Mr. Putin said."

53,China’s Wuhan sees first new virus cases since lockdown lifted,"world  Updated: May 12, 2020 10:53 IST  Wuhan, where the global coronavirus epidemic first started, reported its first new infections since the Chinese city ended its 76-day lockdown on April 8.  The six locally transmitted cases, reported on May 10 and 11, were found in people already under quarantine who were asymptomatic before testing positive, according to the local government. All six cases emerged from a single residential compound.  Although the new cases are few and appear under control, they serve as a reminder of the risks China faces as it tries to reopen an economy that has seen its worst contraction since 1992.  “Seven provinces reported new infections over the past 14 days, and clustered cases were continuing to increase,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the National Health Commission, said on Monday. China reported only one confirmed case on Tuesday, with no new infections in Wuhan.  Wuhan will enhance the control of residential areas, expand testing among key people and strengthen the management of asymptomatic patients to contain the spread of the virus, according to a statement Sunday by the city’s health commission.  Fears of resurgence were highlighted on Sunday when the northeastern city of Shulan, which borders North Korea, was partially locked down after 11 new infections were discovered. Many cities in China still don’t allow cinemas and bars to operate, and heavy restrictions against social gatherings remain in place. Face masks are required for public transport and entering stores and public facilities."
54,China reports 16 new coronavirus cases amid fears of second wave,"China reported one new coronavirus case and 15 asymptomatic infections, a day after a fresh COVID-19 cluster emerged in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged.  China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on Tuesday said one imported case was recorded in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Monday while no local infections were reported.  Chinese experts are reassuring the public over concerns regarding a potential second wave of the epidemic, after clustered infections of COVID-19 have re-emerged in two provinces, state-run Global Times reported on Tuesday.  The experts called such sporadic cases as normal for major infectious diseases.  Despite the increasing number of new infection cases, Chinese medical experts said that clustered infections in Wuhan, Hubei Province and Shulan, Jilin Province are sporadic and don’t imply a second wave is looming.  After the clustered infections emerged, officials from both Jilin and Hubei provinces are ramping up efforts to trace close contacts while adopting lockdown measures to contain the infection from spreading to wider regions, the report said.  Since Sunday, Wuhan has reported a total of six new cases of COVID-19, all of which are from the same local community.  The ruling Communist Party of China has sacked a local official on Monday for negligence.  Shulan city in Jilin Province bordering North Korea on Sunday imposed martial law after a sudden spike in coronavirus cases.  The city reported 11 cases on Saturday and three more on Sunday.  Also on Monday, 15 new asymptomatic cases were reported in the country taking the total number of cases to 760, the NHC said.  In Wuhan, 606 asymptomatic cases were under medical observation, the local health commission said on Tuesday.  Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested COVID-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat.  However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others.  The death toll from coronavirus in China remains at 4,633 with fatalities last reported on Monday, while the total number of cases increased to 82,919, including 115 patients still undergoing treatment in hospital."
55,Local official sacked as COVID-19 epicentre Wuhan reports new cases,"China's ruling Communist Party has sacked an official for COVID-19 mismanagement in Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged, following a sudden spike in the cases in the central Chinese city which remained infection free for over 30 days.  Zhang Yuxin, who was the secretary and member of the Changqing Street working committee of the ruling Communist Party of China, was removed from the post after the cases emerged in the Sanmin residential community in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, the Xinhua news agency reported.  All the cases were reported in the Sanmin residential community, which is under the jurisdiction of Changqing Street.  Zhang was sacked for his poor management of the closing-off and control of the residential community, which had previously reported 20 COVID-19 cases, it said.  Five cases were reported on Sunday, while one on Saturday in Wuhan which remained free from infections for 35 days.  Li Ping, director of the Dongxihu District Health Bureau, said more than 20,000 people will undergo nucleic acid testing in batches following the emergence of the new cases.  Among the people who will undergo testing, over 5,000 are residents in and around Sanmin residential community, and the other 14,000 are from the nearby market named Duoluokou.  Wuhan also has reported 650 asymptomatic cases.  Asymptomatic cases refer to the people who are tested COVID-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others.  Hubei province, which has a population of over 56 million, was kept under lockdown from January 23 to contain the virus. It was lifted on March 24.  Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, lifted the lockdown on April 8.  Meanwhile, China has downgraded the COVID-19 risk levels in all regions signalling its containment as the country has almost returned to normalcy with business and factories resuming their operations following government directives with warnings not to be complacent.  On Monday, China opened its most prominent theme park, Shanghai Disneyland, with anti-virus controls.  Gyms and other entertainment centres are also being gradually opened up.

The new cases have triggered fear of a second wave of infections in China, which has been gradually easing to normalcy with risk-levels downgraded across the country in recent weeks.  The city of Wuhan in Hubei province reported five new cases on Monday, a day after it confirmed the first Covid-19 case since the first week of April.  Since Sunday, Wuhan reported a total of six new cases of Covid-19, all of which are from the same local community, Sanmin neighbourhood in the Dongxihu district of Wuhan, the tabloid Global Times reported on Monday.  Emergency response level has been raised in the area from low to medium on Monday and nearly 5,000 residents in the neighbourhood were expected to take nucleic acid tests to screen for the disease.  The NHC said on Monday that it had received reports of 17 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland on Sunday, of which seven were imported cases reported in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.  At least 11 cases connected to a local laundry worker were reported over the weekend, according to state broadcaster CCTV, prompting the citywide lockdown of Shulan, with a population of around 6,70,000 people, in the northeastern province of Jilin.  On Monday, Shulan declared a full-scale “wartime” control mode in response to clustered infections where the confirmed cases were reported.  The citywide investigation of close contacts had traced 2005 people, 290 close contacts have been located and quarantined, state media reported.  China until Monday had reported nearly 83,000 cases of Covid-19 and 4,633 deaths.  Nearly 68,000 of those cases have been reported from Hubei, the Chinese province worst-hit in the outbreak; Wuhan has reported more than 50,000 of the cases."
57,Trump ‘not interested’ in reopening US-China trade deal after report of Beijing discontent,"business  Updated: May 12, 2020 08:25 IST  US President Donald Trump said on Monday he opposed renegotiating the US-China “Phase 1” trade deal after a Chinese state-run newspaper reported some government advisers in Beijing were urging fresh talks and possibly invalidating the agreement.  Trump, who himself has considered abandoning the pact signed in January, told a White House press briefing he wanted to see if Beijing lived up to the deal to massively increase purchases of US goods.  “No, not at all. Not even a little bit,” Trump said when asked if he would entertain the idea of reworking Phase 1. “I’m not interested. We signed a deal. I had heard that too, they’d like to reopen the trade talk, to make it a better deal for them.”  The Global Times tabloid reported on Monday that unidentified advisers close to the talks have suggested that Chinese officials revive the possibility of invalidating the trade pact and negotiate a new one to tilt the scales more to the Chinese side.  The Global Times is published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party. While not an official party mouthpiece, the Global Times’ views are believed at times to reflect those of its leaders.  NEW SOYBEAN PURCHASES  Hours after the report was published, Chinese importers on Monday bought at least four cargoes, or about 240,000 tonnes, of US soybeans on Monday for shipment beginning in July, and additional sales are possible, two traders familiar with the deals said on Monday.  The purchases were the latest in a recent string by China, which US officials say has also begun implementing other parts of the trade deal regarding intellectual property protections.  The US Trade Representative’s office did not respond to repeated queries on the Global Times article.  Under the Phase 1 deal signed in January, Beijing pledged to buy at least $200 billion in additional US goods and services over two years while Washington agreed to roll back tariffs in stages on Chinese goods.  Trump, who has blamed China’s early handling of the new coronavirus outbreak in its central city of Wuhan for thousands of US deaths and millions of job losses, said last week he was “very torn” about whether to end the Phase 1 trade deal. Those comments came just hours after top trade officials from both countries pledged to press ahead with implementing the agreement.  ‘TSUNAMI OF ANGER’  Rising US-China tensions over the coronavirus outbreak have cast the trade deal and proposed talks on a Phase 2 deal into doubt.  The Trump administration asserted there was evidence the new coronavirus came from a Wuhan laboratory, an allegation that China has rejected. On Monday, a new source of tension opened up, with reports that the administration is planning to issue a warning that computer hackers tied to the Chinese government are attempting to steal information from US researchers.  US intelligence and law enforcement officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The Global Times said malicious attacks by the United States have ignited a “tsunami of anger” among Chinese trade insiders after China made compromises in the Phase 1 pact.  “It’s in fact in China’s interests to terminate the current Phase 1 deal,” a trade adviser to the Chinese government told the Global Times, citing the weakening US economy and upcoming US presidential elections. “The US now cannot afford to restart the trade war with China if everything goes back to the starting point.”  Clete Willems, a former White House trade adviser who took an active role in the US-China negotiations, said China had followed through on the majority of the structural provisions in the Phase 1 deal, including new rules to protect intellectual property.  “I don’t think we’re at the point where we should give up on the deal. It has yielded positive results thus far,” said Willems, who is now with the Akin Gump law firm in Washington."

59,China suspends penalties on more U.S. goods in trade truce,"China suspended punitive tariffs on more U.S. goods including radar equipment for aviation on Tuesday amid pressure from President Donald Trump to buy more imports as part of a truce in their trade war.  The Ministry of Finance said tariff increases on 79 types of goods including radar sets, disinfectant and rare earths minerals would be suspended for one year starting May 19.  Washington agreed in January to cancel additional tariff hikes and Beijing committed to buy more American farm exports. U.S. officials said China agreed to address complaints about its technology policies.  Mr. Trump threatened on May 3 to terminate the agreement if China fails to buy more American goods.  Mr. Trump said earlier that Beijing agreed to buy $200 billion of American farm goods and other exports. China resumed purchases of American soybeans but has yet to confirm the size of its commitment.  Mr. Trump’s threat rekindled fears in financial markets of more U.S.-Chinese conflict and potential disruption of global trade at a time when economies are reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  The two sides have raised duties on tens of billions of dollars of each other’s imports in a dispute over China’s technology ambitions and trade surplus.  Slumping economic activity due to the virus has prompted suggestions that China might be unable to carry out commitments to boost imports.  Last week, U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators promised to create “favorable conditions” for carrying out the truce, China’s government announced. The two sides gave no timeline for more talks.  Tuesday’s announcement was the third Chinese tariff cut since the January agreement.  Beijing announced on February 6 that it would reduce duties on $75 billion of U.S. goods. It followed up by rolling back penalties on a list of goods that included medical and industrial machinery."
60,All major economies will be drawn into US-China contestations over international trade,"Even without the COVID-19 emergency, the questions of foreign trade and China would have been quite central to Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. (File) Even without the COVID-19 emergency, the questions of foreign trade and China would have been quite central to Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. (File)  Abolish the World Trade Organisation is the kind of demand you would expect to hear from diehard opponents of free trade on the left and right extremes of the Indian political spectrum. But it has come in a forceful article published last week in The New York Times by a US senator, Josh Hawley, from Missouri.  In his essay, Hawley says the emergency triggered by the corona pandemic is not a mere health crisis. With millions of Americans unemployed, “it is also an economic crisis. And it has exposed a hard truth about the modern global economy: it weakens American workers and has empowered China’s rise.”  Opinion | Both US and China face internal credibility crisis  Calling for a sweeping reform, Hawley wants the US to begin by abandoning the WTO. Hawley acknowledged that under WTO, “capital and goods moved across borders easier than before”; but added, “so did jobs”. “And too many jobs left America’s borders for elsewhere. As factories closed, workers suffered, from small towns to the urban core.”  Hawley’s attack is not limited to the trading system. He takes on the mythos of the “liberal international order”. He derides America’s post-Cold War crusade to overturn the system of sovereign states into one without borders and supra-national institutions in the name of lasting peace and prosperity.  “That new order’s universal peace never quite arrived”, says Hawley. “Instead, the internationalists embroiled America in one foreign war after another. And their liberal economic order fared little better. It sent American production overseas, compromised American supply chains, and cost American jobs, all while enriching Communist China.”  Opinion | COVID-19 has sharpened US-China conflict  Hawley’s critique of the WTO and liberal international order was quickly panned by economists and editorialists as wrong in fact and theory. But Hawley is not looking for good grades from his professors. He is making an important political point amidst a major crisis within the US that has come bang in the middle of a general election.  Even without the covid-19 emergency, the question of foreign trade and China would have been quite central to Trump’s re-election campaign, as they were in the 2016 elections. The choice of former Vice President Jo Biden as the Democratic nominee has made trade and China even more important in this election.  Unlike Bernie Sanders, the Democratic rival for the nomination, Biden has been a strong champion of free trade and of economic integration with China. The Trump campaign is determined target his record on these two issues to secure the crucial vote of working people in the American heartland. Hawley is simply channeling the essence of that argument that is expected to be decisive in this election.  As the Trump campaign whips up the theme of “Beijing Biden”, the Democrats can’t afford to be seen as defending China and will find hard to be more hawkish than the Republicans. On trade issues, the Democrats are signalling a tilt to the left, but can’t afford to break with powerful backers in the Wall Street and Silicon Valley, who are deeply committed to globalisation. Trump is eager to probe these contradictions.  After his OpEd in the ‘Times’, Hawley has moved a resolution in the US Senate asking Washington to walk out of WTO. The last time the US congress discussed such a resolution was during 2005. The House of Representatives had thrown it out with a massive margin of 338-86.  But trade politics in the US have evolved significantly in recent years. Under Trump, the Republican Party has turned from the champion to a critic of free trade. The Democratic Party, which embraced globalisation since the early 1990s, has seen the erosion of working class support. Elections this year could reveal if the shifting alignments on trade are now cast in stone and if anti-trade sentiment in America is deep and wide.  In replacing the WTO, Hawley says, “the United States must seek new arrangements and new rules, in concert with other free nations, to restore America’s economic sovereignty”, he suggests. This in turn involves, “building a new network of trusted friends and partners to resist Chinese economic imperialism”.  As it takes a fresh look at the global economy battered by the coronavirus, Delhi should pay close attention to Hawley’s theme on working with “trusted friends and parters” to restructure international trade. Hawley is not alone in articulating this view. Last week, Reuters reported from Washington that the Trump Administration is “turbocharging” an initiative to rearrange the global supply chains currently centred on China.  Significant political contestations within the US and between the US and China to reform, reorient or bypass the WTO system are at hand. All major economies will be drawn into this conflict. Hobbled as it was by shaky political coalitions and preoccupied by multiple domestic challenges, India in the mid-1990s struggled to cope with the profound changes in the global economic order. As the world trade system arrives at a contingent moment a quarter of a century later, India is hopefully better prepared.

61,Trump rules out reopening negotiations on trade deal with China,"Under the US-China trade deal signed in January, Beijing agreed to buy at least USD 200 billion more in US products and services in 2020-2021. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Under the US-China trade deal signed in January, Beijing agreed to buy at least USD 200 billion more in US products and services in 2020-2021. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  President Donald Trump has said he is “not interested” in reopening negotiations on the trade deal with China, days after the US warned Beijing of “very significant consequences” for not honouring the bilateral agreement early this year to end their bruising trade war.  Trump’s remarks came in response to a question on a report in Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post which said that China would like to reopen negotiations on the trade deal to make the terms more favourable to Beijing.  “Is this something you’d be interested in doing?” he was asked.  “No. Not at all. Not even a little bit. No, I’m not interested. We signed the deal. I had heard that, too — they’d like to reopen the trade talk to make it a better deal for them,” Trump told reporters during a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday.  China, Trump said, has been taking advantage of the US for many decades because his predecessors allowed that to happen. “No, I’m not interested in that. Let’s see if they live up to the deal that they signed,” he said.  US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on May 4 warned that if China does not honour the trade agreement, “there would be very significant consequences in the relationship and in the global economy as to how people would do business with them.”  Trump too had earlier said that he will terminate the trade deal with China, if they do not honour its provisions in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic that originated in the country.  Under the US-China trade deal signed in January, Beijing agreed to buy at least USD 200 billion more in US products and services in 2020-2021, the two-year period than it did in 2017.  However, the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in a report said that China could invoke a clause in the agreement that allows for fresh trade consultations between the two countries “in the event of a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event”.  The coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, ravaging economies and increasing unemployment. The global health crisis has left a record 33 million workers jobless in the US.  According to the Johns Hopkins University data, over 4 million people are infected by the COVID-19 and more than 280,000 people have died worldwide. The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.3 million infected cases and more than 80,000 deaths.  Responding to another question, Trump said that there was nothing new in the news reports that Chinese hackers are attempting to steal American technology related to vaccine research.  “So, what else is new with China? What else is new? Tell me. I’m not happy with China. They should have stopped this (spread of coronavirus) at the source. They could have stopped it right at the source. So now you’re telling me they’re hacking? So, I just say this: What else is new? We’re watching it very closely,” he said.  China has rejected the US allegations that it tried to cover up the COVID-19 cases. According to news reports, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are planning to issue a public warning about China’s attempts to steal research on coronavirus treatments.  “I’ve said it over and over again, there is something deeply suspicious about China’s role in this pandemic,” said Mike Rogers, House Homeland Security Committee ranking member.  “Now, China is trying to hack into our systems and to steal our information on COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, and testing. It’s outrageous and it’s corrupt. We must take all steps necessary to protect our intellectual property from getting into the wrong hands, and we must ensure that they have the necessary resources and authorities to do so,” Rogers said.  Meanwhile, the Trump administration on Monday asked the federal retirement funds to not to invest in the Chinese equities.  📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

62,"Coronavirus vaccine may never be found, warns UK PM Boris Johnson","London: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that a mass vaccine for the novel coronavirus may be over a year away and, in the worst-case scenario, may in fact never be found.  In his foreword to the government’s new 50-page guidance on a step by step easing of the lockdown measures in place to control the spread of the deadly virus, the UK prime minister lays out plans for businesses to gradually start reopening with “COVID-19 Secure"" measures of social distancing and for the public to use “good solid British common sense"" as the economy is unlocked.  “A mass vaccine or treatment may be more than a year away,"" said Johnson, highlighting the work being done in the UK by scientists at Oxford University and Imperial College London towards this mission.  “Indeed, in a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine. So our plan must countenance a situation where we are in this, together, for the long haul, even while doing all we can to avoid that outcome,"" he said.  Admitting that a vaccine or drug-based treatment is the only “feasible long-term solution"", he said the UK has accelerated this with “promising"" vaccine development programmes and a collaboration between Oxford University and pharma major AstraZeneca was a vital step that could help rapidly advance the manufacture of a COVID-19 vaccine when it is ready.  As part of global efforts, he flagged the 388 million pound in aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatment, including 250 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.  “But while we hope for a breakthrough, hope is not a plan,"" he said, as he unveiled his plan for starting to lift lockdown restrictions from this week in phases.  Following a televised address to the nation on Sunday night and a statement in Parliament on Monday, the guidance comes into effect in public life across England from Wednesday when people will be allowed one-to-one contact with people other than those they live with, as long as they remain outside and two metres apart.  They are allowed to play sport with a friend or family member from outside their household or socialise with them in the open air for the first time in more than six weeks since the lockdown was imposed.  People are still advised to work from home where possible but start heading into work where necessary, in sectors such as construction and manufacturing, keeping the social distancing norms in place.  Under the step by step plan, by the start of next month non-essential shops will also reopen, with some hairdressers, pubs and cinemas to follow from July. However, as part of a COVID-19 Alert System, if infection rates are seen to be rising again, restrictions would be tightened “possibly at short notice"".  Fines for breaching the new rules will also be increased to 100 pound and will double for each repeat offence, up to a maximum of 3,200 pound.  Johnson said: ""I must ask the country to be patient with a continued disruption to our normal way of life, but to be relentless in pursuing our mission to build the systems we need. The worst possible outcome would be a return to the virus being out of control – with the cost to human life, and – through the inevitable re-imposition of severe restrictions – the cost to the economy. We must stay alert, control the virus, and in doing so, save lives.  “Then, as vaccines and treatment become available, we will move to another new phase, where we will learn to live with COVID-19 for the longer term without it dominating our lives.""

63,"Covid-19: PM Johnson’s lockdown message under fire as UK death toll crosses 32,000","world  Updated: May 11, 2020 21:08 IST  The Boris Johnson government on Monday came under fire from the opposition Labour, leaders of Scotland, Wales and members of the public for allegedly confusing messages on easing lockdown curbs, as the UK-wide death toll reached 32,065.  Johnson dropped the hitherto core message to ‘stay home’ in a widely watched televised address on Sunday evening, but Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon pointed out that his announcement applied only to England and that Scotland would retain the ‘stay home’ advice.  The number of coronavirus cases in the UK rose to 223,060, the Department of Health and Social Care said.  Instead of the ‘stay home’ advice, Johnson said people should now ‘stay alert’ and those who cannot work from home should be “actively encouraged” to return to work. But the new advice was promptly criticised by Labour, trade unions and people for lack of clarity.  A 60-page document setting out details of the new official advice was published on Monday afternoon, which included covering the face in public places. A five-stage alert system was also announced.  Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “I was actually quite surprised the prime minister said, effectively in 12 hours’ time, start going back to work without those (guidelines on making workplaces safe) in place”.  “We needed that clarity and it is unravelling a bit this morning because I think the foreign secretary (Dominic Raab) has now said, ‘Well, go back to work doesn’t really mean until Wednesday’, so suddenly it has shifted.”  First ministers of Scotland and Wales said they would retain the ‘stay home’ message.  Sturgeon said: “I think the prime minister has to make it clearer when he is talking only for England. What I don’t think is right for any government to do is to say we’re encouraging people to go back to work who haven’t worked so far before the guidance on what a safe working environment is has been published. That’s the bit that should come first.”  Wales first minister Mark Drakeford added: “There are some differences in the messaging between England and Wales which I am concerned may cause confusion”."
64,"COVID-19 vaccine may never be found, warns British PM Boris Johnson- The New Indian Express","By PTI  LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that a mass vaccine for the novel coronavirus may be over a year away and, in the worst-case scenario, may in fact never be found.  In his foreword to the government's new 50-page guidance on a step by step easing of the lockdown measures in place to control the spread of the deadly virus, the UK prime minister lays out plans for businesses to gradually start reopening with ""COVID-19 Secure"" measures of social distancing and for the public to use ""good solid British common sense"" as the economy is unlocked.  ""A mass vaccine or treatment may be more than a year away,"" said Johnson, highlighting the work being done in the UK by scientists at Oxford University and Imperial College London towards this mission.  READ| UK PM Boris Johnson launches new COVID-19 alert system as lockdown rules 'modified'  ""Indeed, in a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine. So our plan must countenance a situation where we are in this, together, for the long haul, even while doing all we can to avoid that outcome,"" he said.  Admitting that a vaccine or drug-based treatment is the only feasible long-term solution, he said the UK has accelerated this with promising vaccine development programmes and collaboration between Oxford University and pharma major AstraZeneca was a vital step that could help rapidly advance the manufacture of a Covid-19 vaccine when it is ready.  As part of global efforts, he flagged the GBP 388 million in aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatment, including GBP 250m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.  ""But while we hope for a breakthrough, hope is not a plan,"" he said, as he unveiled his plan for starting to lift lockdown restrictions from this week in phases.  Following a televised address to the nation on Sunday night and a statement in Parliament on Monday, the guidance comes into effect in public life across England from Wednesday when people will be allowed one-to-one contact with people other than those they live with, as long as they remain outside and two metres apart.  They are allowed to play sport with a friend or family member from outside their household or socialise with them in the open air for the first time in more than six weeks since the lockdown was imposed.  People are still advised to work from home where possible but start heading into work where necessary, in sectors such as construction and manufacturing, keeping the social distancing norms in place.  Under the step by step plan, by the start of next month non-essential shops will also reopen, with some hairdressers, pubs and cinemas to follow from July.  However, as part of a Covid-19 Alert System, if infection rates are seen to be rising again, restrictions would be tightened ""possibly at short notice"".  Fines for breaching the new rules will also be increased to GBP 100 and will double for each repeat offence, up to a maximum of GBP 3,200.  Johnson said: ""I must ask the country to be patient with a continued disruption to our normal way of life, but to be relentless in pursuing our mission to build the systems we need.  The worst possible outcome would be a return to the virus being out of control with the cost to human life, and through the inevitable re-imposition of severe restrictions the cost to the economy.  We must stay alert, control the virus, and in doing so, save lives.  ""Then, as vaccines and treatment become available, we will move to another new phase, where we will learn to live with Covid-19 for the longer term without it dominating our lives. The devolved administrations of Scotland and Wales are putting their own measures in place and keeping the stay at home message in place, rather than switch to the new stay alert message.  The UK government's latest messaging has come under attack from the Opposition and other sections of society over a feared lack of clarity for the general public."
65,"If we follow Boris Johnson's advice, coronavirus will spread | David Hunter","For over two months now, Britain’s public health specialists have been asking why the government abandoned the basic infection-control practice of “test, trace, isolate”. Most of us have suggested that a system to do this was a precondition of easing the lockdown. The key words in Boris Johnson’s speech on Sunday were “you should go to work if you can’t work from home”. He made no mention of preparations for tracing and testing contacts of people who test positive for Covid-19. In the plan published today, a newly appointed test and trace taskforce will begin to develop such a system.  The countries that have succeeded in taming their coronavirus epidemics – such as South Korea, Taiwan, China, Australia and New Zealand – differ from the UK in many ways. But they all have in common “test, trace, isolate” as the centrepiece of their strategy.  The UK government claims to be “following the science”, but it seems the science now needs to catch up with a government that is prioritising concerns about economic damage over epidemic control. The economic damage is clear, and the lockdown will also have knock-on health effects due to unemployment, domestic abuse, and postponed diagnoses and treatments. But if science is the rationale, why not level with the public and show the data that suggests the return to work is now the lesser evil? If there is evidence from modelling that social distancing while at work or commuting – rather than sheltering at home – is sufficient for virus control, let us see it.  The government may have reasons to lift the lockdown before a “test, trace, isolate” system is in place but we do not know what they are. Some will see an ongoing commitment to “herd immunity” behind the lack of public health actions in the speech. However, I believe no UK government would select this as the preferred scenario. And emerging antibody data from hard-hit cities such as New York show that, with less than a quarter of the population affected, it would take at least another wave of devastation to get close to the herd immunity threshold.  Play Video 3:18 Coronavirus: what are Boris Johnson's new lockdown rules? - video explainer  It is possible that the data shows that there is still too much virus circulating in Britain and that a tracing system would be overwhelmed. Johnson hinted at this when he said that the quarantining of arriving travellers would be imposed only “with transmission significantly lower” – in other words, imported virus is still just a fraction of domestic virus transmission. If that is the case, however, telling people to go back to work is very risky advice.  It is also probable that the testing system does not yet have the required capacity, or that not enough contact tracers have been hired. However, there is unused capacity in local councils that the government is choosing not to tap.  The mantra for the past seven weeks has been to “protect the NHS” by staying at home. Surely the intent was also to use this time to prepare for the calibrated end to the lockdown. What we got in the prime minister’s speech was advice to go back to work this week without using public transport (unless we can work from home), and a promise to reimpose the lockdown if Covid-19 flared up again. What we did not get was any list of the actions in place to pursue and contain the virus.  All this is reminiscent of another government soundbite, “the right steps at the right time”. That idea did not work out so well at the start of the epidemic – when mixed messages and a stuttering set of interventions resulted in the virus spreading. On Sunday Johnson said: “We have been through the initial peak.” He is quite right that coming down the mountain is “often more dangerous” – particularly if the peak was higher than it needed to be – but why make the descent even more perilous by refusing to deploy all the tools to hand. No mountaineer would do so without the right equipment.  What many public health specialists hoped to hear was a commitment not only to scaling up testing but to deploying it in a more targeted manner. A commitment to work in partnership with the devolved governments and the regional and local authorities. And a commitment to use the tests to reduce virus transmission. If the government has decided these actions are premature then, at the very least, the piloting of these strategies needs to take place.  Those defending the government’s Covid-19 response have reasonably pointed out that policy mistakes are always clearer in retrospect. So let me make a prediction. If we take the prime minister’s advice and return to work in large numbers now – and without the ability to test, trace and isolate – then virus spread will increase, there will be super-spreader events and local or regional lockdowns will have to be reconsidered. The prime minister implied in his speech that relapse will somehow be our fault – we were not sufficiently “alert”. The responsibility will lie, however, with a government that has encouraged a premature return to work before the epidemiologic conditions and interventions were in place to make it safe to do so."
66,Boris Johnson's message to the working class: good luck out there | Owen Jones,"Boris Johnson’s televised address left a nation baffled, but there was one message the clarity of which should not be doubted. If you are a middle-class professional, then you can keep safely working from home, and whether you venture outside for leisure, exercise or sunbathing is entirely up to you. For everybody else, it’s time to get back to work, and best of luck!  An alliance of Tory libertarians, who believe in freedom for those can afford it, and wealthy Conservative backers, who are rather more interested in profit margins than the lives of vulnerable and older people, have grown tired of lockdown, quite unlike the public as a whole. And so Johnson’s messy compromise, as mentioned in his Sunday night address to the nation, is to “actively encourage” a return to work for those who cannot do so from home: factory workers, but not managers; cleaners, but not accountants.  Coronavirus is a class issue. It is not an indiscriminate grim reaper, selecting its victims at random with no regard for boundaries of class or ethnicity. It targets those with pre-existing health conditions, which are more likely to be found among poorer Britons. It has largely spared those who can earn their keep from their living rooms using Zoom, quite unlike those whose working lives make human contact an unavoidable necessity. According to the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics, the lowest working-age death toll has been among men with professional occupations; the highest death toll has been among men toiling in low-skilled elementary occupations. If you boil down the statistics even more, the hardest hit include taxi drivers, bus drivers, security guards, chefs and care workers. More than 200 construction workers had died by 20 April, and as one trade unionist puts it: “How many of these died for that luxury flat, retail unit, football stadium or hotel?”  We have already learned that there is a stark ethnic divide: black people, for example, are four times more likely to die of coronavirus than white people. Class and race intersect in British society: people of colour are disproportionately concentrated in the lowest-paid jobs. While 11% of the British workforce is BAME, that figure rises to 44% of cab drivers and chauffeurs, 32% of security guards and 19% of bus and coach drivers and care workers. Some of those workers most exposed to poverty and discrimination have been left most exposed to this potentially deadly virus too.  As ever larger swathes of the British working class are ordered to return to their function as generators of revenue, the class impact of this pandemic will only be heightened. Avoid using public transport, suggests our prime minister: but that is rather easier for high earners, almost all of whom have access to a car, compared to the poorest, over half of whom do not. The children of the well-to-do can not only frolic in suburban gardens, but can now enjoy car journeys to the Peak District and the Broads; many of the urban poor, crammed into tower blocks and overcrowded council estates, do not have that option.  We are now told that we can apparently meet one friend or relative from outside our household at a time, but only in an outdoor public space while observing social distance; violating that rule may lead to financial penalties. How, then, does it make logical sense to ban larger gatherings outside for leisure purposes, but compel people to return to work indoors in close proximity to far greater numbers? The only conclusion that can be drawn is that the health, and even lives, of working-class people are judged to be expendable for a greater cause: profit margins and shareholder returns.  Now we know what the “blue-collar Conservatism” marketed to the fallen Red Wall – where the Conservative party gained seats in last year’s election – really means. “Stay alert” means “stay at home but only if you can afford it”. This is “save middle-class lives” in deed if not word. The well-to-do will remain shielded while their workers risk their safety to maintain their fortunes. The class system prevails, even to the morgue.  • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"
67,Coronavirus impact: March IIP contracts by record 16.7%,"New Delhi: India’s factory output contracted by a record 16.7% in March as economic activity came to a standstill due to the ongoing nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, which may in turn adversely impact the GDP print for FY20 to be released later this month.  The lockdown, which came into effect on 25 March, also impacted data collection for both the Index of Industrial Production and Consumer Price Index, so much so that the National Statistical Office did not release the retail inflation number for April. It only released price movements of selected sub-groups of CPI as field investigators had to rely on telephonic enquiry for data collection from the designated outlets that showed food inflation picking up in April by 10.5% from 8.76% a month ago. Mint had reported on 9 April that travel restrictions put in place as part of the lockdown will impact the quality of retail inflation data.  ""In view of the global Covid-19 pandemic and consequent nationwide lockdown measures implemented since March, 2020, the data flow from the producing units was impacted. As some of these units are yet to resume operations, the response rate has been lower than usual. Consequently, the Quick Estimates are likely to undergo revision and will be incorporated in subsequent releases as per the revision policy of IIP,"" said Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation in a statement.  Factory output data during March showed manufacturing output contracted 20.6% while electricity generation shrank 6.8% and mining output remained flat. For the full year FY20, IIP contracted 0.7% as against 3.8% growth in FY19, which could impact the final GDP growth print for FY20, slated to be released later this month. Most economists expect GDP to grow close to 4.5% in FY20 as against NSO’s earlier estimate of 5% growth.  Most forecasters have also slashed their GDP growth projections for FY21 fearing prolonged impact of the lockdown on the Indian economy. Moody’s expects the economy to grow at 0% in FY21, while Swiss bank UBS projected the country’s economy to contract 3.1% if mobility restrictions largely stay in place until end-June and economic activity returns to normal by end-August.  Country’s eight infrastructure sectors contracted by a record 6.5% in March after touching an 11-month high in February, data released by industry department last month showed. India’s manufacturing and services Purchasing Managers’ Index have also slumped to record lows in April stoking fears that the economy is headed for a recession as a crushing lockdown shut businesses and kept consumers indoors.  “The picture for April would be worse with virtual nil growth in most sectors which will mean a very large dip in growth rate in manufacturing. Only some segments like food and pharma could show positive growth,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings said.  India’s nationwide lockdown, considered the severest in the world, has led to massive retrenchment and loss of output. Unemployment rate climbed to a staggering 27.1% in the week to 3 May, while around 121.5 million reported job losses in April, data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showed.  In the ongoing third phase of the lockdown, which ends on 17 May, government has relaxed rules for restarting economic activities, especially for green and orange zones, which either don’t have any or have low incidences of coronavirus cases. However, businesses are treading cautiously given existing supply bottlenecks and migrant workers leaving for home states.  The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Tuesday said it has resumed operations at its Manesar plant in Haryana after around 40 days of closure with 50% of the workforce. Several automakers such as Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Toyota Kirloskar Motor India Ltd, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors’ owned Royal Enfield, TVS Motor Co. and Mercedes Benz have reopened their factories this month.  Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA Ltd said she expects a realignment of prices only once the economic activity resumes in various sectors, to reflect the post-covid demand-supply balance. “Given the likely muted demand for most non-essential items, weak pricing power for producers, and favourable base effect related to food items in the second half of FY2021, the average CPI inflation is expected to cool to around 4.0% with a downside bias in FY2021 from 4.8% in FY2020. We expect the Monetary Policy Committee to reduce the Repo rate by 40 bps to 4.0%, at or before the next scheduled policy review in June 2020, to soften the blow related to the Covid-19 pandemic on economic activity,"" she added.

70,Coronavirus impact: Factory output contracts by record 16.7% in March,"India's factory output, measured in Index of Industrial Production (IIP), steeply contracted by 16.7 per cent in March amid complete shutdown of industries due to coronavirus lockdown. It's a drastic contrast to a growth of 4.5 per cent in February. While the manufacturing output fell 20.6 per cent, electricity output shrank 6.8 per cent, the government data released Tuesday showed. The mining output remained stagnant in March, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.  However, the government also issued a caveat that the drastic fall is on account of coronavirus lockdown. ""In view of the global COVID-19 pandemic and consequent nationwide lockdown measures implemented since March, 2020, the data flow from the producing units was impacted. As some of these units are yet to resume operations, the response rate has been lower than usual. Consequently, the Quick Estimates are likely to undergo revision and will be incorporated in subsequent releases as per the revision policy of IIP,"" the ministry also said.  After hitting a 11-month high in February, the eight infrastructure sectors shrank 6.5 per cent in March. Earlier, the Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, fell to 27.4 last month from March's 51.8, by far its lowest since the survey began in March 2005. It is the first time it has gone below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction in nearly three years. ""After making it through March relatively unscathed, the Indian manufacturing sector felt the full force of the coronavirus pandemic in April,"" IHS Markit said.  India has been under a lockdown since March 25. The coronavirus lockdown is expected to be lifted on May 17.  ""Since the lockdown has extended in the month of April 2020 and first half of May 2020, the industrial output in April 2020 is also expected to decline as many industries remained shut during this period. Even the partial ease in restriction in certain parts has not led to resumption of activities to full capacity due to labour shortages. Thus, we expect IIP to contract even in the months of April and May 2020 post which it may improve marginally,"" said CARE Ratings.  ""India's industrial output slumped to 16.7% in March from 4.5% in Feb, as the lockdown brought all activities to a sudden halt. The weakness in demand, labour constraints, and shortage in raw material shortages, had got a terrible hit. IIP indicates a shape down in GDP,"" said Rahul Gupta, Head of Research- Currency, Emkay Global Financial Services.

78,Rahul Bhatia’s InterGlobe eyes bankrupt Virgin Australia,"(File photo)  No interest in VA, made no proposal, says IndiGo  NEW DELHI: InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE) is eyeing Australia’s second-largest airline Virgin Australia Holdings , which went bankrupt last month amid the coronavirus pandemic.While IGE said “it does not comment on speculation as a rule,” it is learnt to be examining bidding for Virgin Australia and has appointed a consultant.No bids have been put in yet. The first round of bids have to be submitted by May 15. So far, 20 likely bidders have evinced interest.Virgin Australia stakeholders include Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, Singapore Airlines and Richard Branson’s Virgin Group . The VA deal is being examined by IGE and not by group company IndiGo .VA has appointed a team of Deloitte administrators to “recapitalise the business and ensure it emerges in a stronger financial position on the other side of the Covid-19 crisis” after Australia refused its request for a $888 million loan.Among the others eyeing VA are Australian PE firm BGH Capital, global investment giants Bain Capital, Brookfield and Oaktree Capital Management, Macquarie Group and three Australian states — Queensland, NSW and Victoria. VA’s total liabilities are close to $7 billion. Morgan Stanley and Houlihan Lokey are conducting the deal for VA’s administrators.IndiGo, India’s only cash surplus airline is officially out of the VA picture. IndiGo CEO Ronojoy Dutta said in a statement: “We refer to certain reports stating that Indi-Go has expressed an interest in Virgin Australia. We deny the contents of these reports and would like to clarify that IndiGo has not formulated any indicative proposal, nor does it have any interest in this matter.”The dynamics of aviation industry will change significantly in a post-pandemic world, with several airlines struggling to survive and some looking for infusion of funds from new investors to revive. Among Indian carriers, IndiGo is the only one with its own cash reserves. Other airlines like GoAir and Vistara are backed by promoters with deep pockets, while state-owned Air India’s divestment process is on. IndiGo has been planning to spread its wings abroad for a long time."

80,IndiGo’s Rahul Bhatia should remember Australia has been a graveyard for foreign airlines,"Text Size: A- A+  What do you get for the airline magnate who has everything? If he knows what’s best for him, the answer isn’t “another airline.”  Rahul Bhatia, the biggest shareholder in India’s biggest carrier, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., is evaluating data and considering a bid for Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd., a person familiar with the matter told Anurag Kotoky and Angus Whitley of Bloomberg News. He would bid via the vehicle he uses to invest in IndiGo, as India’s biggest budget airline is known, the person said.  It’s not hard to see the attractions. IndiGo’s home market is fiercely competitive, with half a dozen major carriers duking it out even after Jet Airways India Ltd. was forced into bankruptcy last year. Jet was squeezed between the loss-making full-service flights offered by state-owned Air India Ltd. and IndiGo’s own devastatingly cheap fares. Australia, on the other hand, is more or less a duopoly between Virgin Australia — which was itself put into a coronavirus-induced administration last month — and a dominant Qantas Airways Ltd. That should offer the opportunity for the two carriers to cozily carve up the market between themselves.  Opportunities to break into the Australian airline game don’t come along often. The last time was when Ansett Australia Ltd. collapsed just days after the Sept. 11 attacks. A fledgling Virgin Australia, at the time a budget carrier named Virgin Blue, was perfectly placed to capitalize.  Despite the vast disparity in population, Australia isn’t that much smaller than India as a market, thanks to greater wealth and a higher propensity to fly. Traffic last year came to about 71 billion revenue passenger kilometers, roughly the size of the fast-growing Indian aviation market five years ago.  It also has close links to India, raising the prospect that an Australian network could feed passengers via international flights into IndiGo’s domestic web of destinations. Indian-Australians make up close to 2% of the population, and the number of non-resident Indians — the subset of the diaspora who are most likely to take regular flights back to the motherland — is the largest after the U.K., U.S., Singapore, Nepal, and the Persian Gulf countries.  For all that, Bhatia should pass up the chance to have a crack at Virgin Australia. In its ruthless efficiency in controlling its home turf, Qantas behaves a lot like IndiGo, one reason that Australia has for a decade been a graveyard for ambitious foreign airlines. His best opportunities lie closer to home.  Both Qantas and IndiGo exploit a rare and priceless phenomenon known as the S-curve, by which dominant airlines end up with more connections and a greater share of traffic the more planes they add. That makes life extremely difficult for competitors.  Singapore’s attempt to set up a bridgehead via an outpost of its budget carrier Tiger Airways Holdings Pte. ended up being sold to Virgin Australia back in 2014 at a valuation of A$2.50 ($1.62), after years of struggle. AirAsia Group Bhd. showed fitful interest in establishing a bigger presence Down Under, but ended up mostly steering clear.  Virgin Australia itself spent years trying to break the Flying Kangaroo’s dominance with the backing of strategic overseas players. Ordinary shareholders hold less than 10% of the now-worthless stock, with the balance being held by a rotating cast of carriers including Etihad Airways PJSC, Singapore Airlines Ltd., Hainan Airlines Holding Co., Qingdao Airlines, Air New Zealand Ltd., and Richard Branson’s Virgin Group itself. Their indifference to profits enabled Virgin to compete against Qantas for longer than many would have thought possible, but it hasn’t been enough to win the battle.  The distance between Australia and India is too great to make connecting the two markets an easy play, too. IndiGo’s aircraft of choice is the Airbus SE A320neo, which some budget carriers have been using to open up longer-range routes — but it would be operating at its limits even on flights between India and Perth, which is a long way from Australia’s more populous east coast. That would necessitate Bhatia either using an unfriendly hub airport in Southeast Asia, or investing in bigger, more expensive twin-aisle jets.  IndiGo is so powerful in its home market that it’s natural its owners should be looking at overseas expansion — but as we’ve argued, the better place for that is in the Persian Gulf, where a far bigger Indian diaspora is closer to home and largely flown across the Arabian Sea on Gulf carriers such as Emirates.  With a pandemic-induced passenger drought threatening most non-state-backed players in the global aviation market, this is no time for Bhatia to go planting seeds in Australia’s barren soil. – Bloomberg  Also read: This is what happens to the world’s planes when they can’t fly for weeks  ThePrint is now on Telegram.

POCO F2 Pro also sports what the company claims to be the largest vapor chamber in any smartphone to support LiquidCool, a technology that keeps the device cool even when a user is playing high-end games such as Fortnite and Pubg.  A total score of 589,983. CPU Benchmark score of 184,817. GFXbench Manhattan 4.0 benchmark score of 40. Yes, the #POCOF2Pro is simply #PowerfullyCool! pic.twitter.com/KgyHJt2dI4 — POCO (@POCOGlobal) May 12, 2020  On the camera front, the POCO F2 Pro features a 64MP Sony IMX686 sensor, which serves as the primary camera, with a 13MP ultra wide-angle lens, a 5MP macro and one 2MP depth sensor. The pop-up camera, that serves as the selfie sensor, is a 20MP lens. The rear camera setup is capable of recording videos in 8K resolution at 24fps, and 4K in 60fps.  The POCO F2 Pro, which comes in Neon Blue, Electric Purple, Cyber Grey, Phantom White colors, houses a 4,700mAh battery with support for fast charging and ships with a 33W charger in the box.  POCO listed a number of additional features that other flagship Android smartphones offer such as support for HDR10+, display brightness of 500 nits, Corning Gorilla Glass 5 that protects the screen, and an IR blaster. But its display lacks support for 120Hz refresh rate — as seen on OnePlus 8T Pro that makes viewing experience extra smooth.  POCO F2 Pro is the second smartphone from the company ever since it spun out of Xiaomi earlier this year. The company’s first product, called Pocophone F1, was launched in 2018 and was well received by the market.  At the time of the launch, Xiaomi executives said they had big plans for the POCO brand but never launched anything afterward. During the period the company also saw a big departure when Jai Mani, a senior product executive, left the firm. Earlier this year, the company launched the mid-range POCO X2 smartphone in India.  POCO executives today shared little plans on what the future hold for the firm. But assured that they are here to stay. “We’re back. It’s been awhile, but we are back,” said Angus Ng, a product marketing manager at POCO."
89,"Poco F2 Pro renders leak, and guess what? They look like a Redmi K30 Pro.","Twitter  Source: Twitter  Although the Poco X2 was the first phone from Poco after the worldwide smash Poco F1, it wasn’t a true follow-up. Now, though, we are nearly certain that the Poco F2 Pro will launch tomorrow as the true successor to the ultra-cheap, ultra-powerful Poco F1.  Now, we have some leaked renders of the F2 Pro (via Ishan Agarwal). The renders only show us the front of the device, but we can tell quite a bit just from the display and bezels.  First off, the front of this phone looks nigh identical to the Redmi K30 Pro. All data we have suggests that Poco — a sub-brand of Xiaomi — is simply taking the design from Redmi (yet another Xiaomi sub-brand) and repackaging it. However, a Poco exec claimed that that was not the case, so we don’t know what to think.  Below is the Redmi K30 Pro. Decide for yourself what to believe:  Note how the bottom bezel and the speaker cutout at the top of the display pretty much line up perfectly with the Poco F2 Pro renders. Also, you can clearly see a red power button on the F2 Pro renders, just like on the K30 Pro.  The four renders of the F2 Pro also show four different colorways. It’s hard to see, but if you look closely you can spot (from left to right) gray/black, purple, white, and blue. I mean, that is even the same order as the renders above for the K30 Pro!  In other words, we’re not sure what that Poco exec was trying to pull, but we are nearly certain that the Poco F2 Pro will look identical to the Redmi K30 Pro and share many of the same specs. We’ll find out tomorrow for certain, though."

91,"Poco F2 Pro unveiled with S865 chipset, 6.67"" Super AMOLED screen and 64MP camera","The Poco F1 was a rare beast, an actual example of a flagship killer. Now, almost two years later it is finally time for a sequel, after the detour named Poco X2  a mid-ranger that was based on the Redmi K30. Actually, it seems it was a change in course rather than a detour as the new model is essentially a rebadged Redmi K30 Pro.  The Poco F2 Pro does bring a long list of improvements compared to the F1, starting with the latest chipset. The Snapdragon 865 is the best chip from Qualcomm yet and one of the first to feature updatable GPU drivers, which might improve the phones longevity.  A lot of emphasis was placed on the LiquidCool 2.0 tech, which has three layers: graphite, graphene and, finally, the ""Super VC"". That vapor chamber is larger than competing phones, which Poco says will enable more efficient cooling.  The F2 Pro will run Android 10 out of the box with Poco Launcher 2.0. Dark mode is available, a must have on AMOLED screens.  Storage now starts at 128GB (twice as much as before) and theres also a 256GB option for those who want more. Plus, this is fast UFS 3.1 storage, up from 2.1. This year its actually something to consider as Xiaomi has axed the microSD slot.  Besides the new chipset, Poco F2 Pros new camera setup may be what pushes die-hard Poco fans to upgrade. The main camera has a 1/1.72 sensor with 64MP resolution, with pixel binning that works out to 16MP photos with 1.6µm effective pixels.  The phone can push in closer with the 2x zoom camera, which has a 5MP sensor and 50mm lens, or go wide with a 13MP camera. Theres also a 2MP depth sensor. There's no dedicated macro camera, the tele cam takes care of that (it's a tele macro, actually, letting you shoot at a comfortable 3-7cm distance).  The more powerful chipset enables 8K recording at 30fps (you probably want the 256GB phone if youre going to shoot in 8K). Also, 4K videos can now be recorded at 60fps.  The final camera is on the front - a 20MP shooter on a motorized pop-up mechanism. This leaves the 6.67 screen completely unblemished. This year its a Super AMOLED panel with HDR+ support, so you can expect a boost in image quality, even if the resolution remains at 1080p+. The switch to AMOLED also allowed the fingerprint reader to move below the screen.  The screen refreshes at a standard 60Hz, but the touch sampling rate has been amped up to 180Hz. The phone has Widevine L1 certificaiton, so it can play HD content from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other services.    6.67"" Super AMOLED display with up to 1,200 nits of brightness  While Xiaomi skipped the microSD slot, it did leave the 3.5mm headphone jack intact  we know many of you dont care for Bluetooth headphones. Although the phone does offer Bluetooth 5.1 with aptX HD.  Finally, we make our way to the battery  its bigger and faster than before. The capacity increased to 4,700mAh (from 4,000mAh) faster 30W charging (up from 18W).  The Poco F2 Pro will be available online, starting at $500/500 for the 6/128GB version. There's also a version with 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage for 600. The phone will be available at AliExpress and Gearbest first. You can pre-order it today, shipping should start on May 19 (a week from now).  It will come to other online distributors - from Amazon through Lazada and Shopee to JD and more. The phone will also sell through the official Poco.net site and the team is working on making the F2 Pro available in offline stores too.  During the presentation, the Galaxy S20+ and OnePlus 8 Pro were often used for comparisons, two shining examples of Android flagships. Here's how the Poco F2 Pro compares against them:"

95,"Vivo V19 Review: Flashy design, good cameras","Image Source : DEVESH ARORA Vivo V19 in Mystic Sliver colour variant.  Vivo has just launched its V19 smartphone in India, which is the successor to the Vivo V17. It competes against phones like Samsung Galaxy A51 and the Poco X2. Vivo V19 comes with features like a Super AMOLED display, an in-display fingerprint scanner, 48MP quad-camera setup on the back. However, the competition is offering high refresh rate displays, better processors and up to 64MP quad cameras. With such competition around, does the Vivo V19 justify its price tag of Rs. 27,990? Let’s find out:  Vivo V19 Review: Specifications  Vivo V19 sports a 6.44-inch Super AMOLED with a resolution of 2400x1080 pixels. The smartphone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 processor coupled with 8GB RAM. For storage, it comes with either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, which is further expandable using a microSD card. It runs on FunTouch OS 10 based on Google’s Android 10 operating system. Under the hood, there is a 4,500mAh battery with support for 33W Flash Charge 2.0 technology.  Image Source : DEVESH ARORA The dual punch-hole design gives it a modern look.  In the camera department, the Vivo V19 features a quad-camera setup at the back consisting of a 48MP primary camera paired with an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 2MP macro lens and a 2MP bokeh camera. For selfies, the handset comes with a dual punch hole camera setup, which includes a 32MP main camera paired with an 8MP super wide-angle lens.  Vivo V19 Review: Design and Display  Vivo V19 looks a lot like the recently launched iQOO 3, but that’s not a bad thing. The design looks modern. The Mystic Silver colour variant, which looks spectacular, and is able to give the back of the phone a mirror and shiny effect. Speaking of the back, it houses just the quad-camera setup and the Vivo branding.  Image Source : DEVESH ARORA It looks quite shiny and offers a mirror effect.  On the bottom edge, the phone sports a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB Type-C port, speaker grille and the primary microphone. The left edge of the phone sports the SIM tray, which can hold two SIM cards and a microSD card.  While the right edge of the phone sports the volume buttons and the power button, the top edge is left clean with the exception of the secondary microphone.

Vivo V19 sports a Super AMOLED display, which offers deeper blacks as well as punchier colours this helps provide a great video watching experience. This also makes room for the in-display fingerprint scanner, which is now faster than ever before.  Vivo V19 Review: Performance, Software and UI  Vivo V19 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 processor paired with 8GB of RAM. The processor is decent enough and the phone was able to perform most of the tasks smoothly. During the review period, I played games like PUBG: Mobile and Call of Duty: Mobile. In PUBG Mobile, I wasn’t able to switch to HDR graphic setting as the phone does not support it. However, in HD settings, I was able to play the game quite smoothly and with no lag whatsoever.  As for the regular usage, the 8GB of RAM was sufficient to fulfil my multi-tasking needs and I was able to keep enough applications on the app switcher. Switching between these apps was quite seamless.  Image Source : DEVESH ARORA Benchmarks from PC Mark, AnTuTu and 3D Mark.  On the software front, Vivo has come a long way. It now provides a much better user experience with its latest FunTouch OS 10. It not only brings the latest version of Android but also a plethora of features including dark mode, gesture-based navigation and more. However, the UI still brings a decent amount of bloatware apps including Helo, Daily Hunt and Opera Browser among others.  Vivo V19 Review: Camera  Vivo V19 sports a quad-camera setup at the back, which includes a 48MP primary camera paired with an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 2MP macro lens and a 2MP depth sensor.

However, the software smoothed out most of the photos I took. I feel that this might be a huge issue for some users.  As for selfies, Vivo V19 comes with a 32MP+8MP dual-camera setup upfront. The camera app had the beauty mode turned on by default, which smoothens the skin tone. Upon turning it off, the selfies came out great. The ultra-wide-angle lens really helps when you need to take selfies with large groups.  Vivo V19 Review: Battery  Vivo V19 is backed by a massive 5,000mAh battery. Not only that but it also comes with support for 33W fast charging. During my time with the smartphone, I was able to make it last one full day with around 35 to 40 per cent juice left for the next day.  While charging the device, it managed to reach about 50 percent from zero in less than 30 minutes.  Vivo V19 Review: Verdict  Image Source : DEVESH ARORA Vivo V19's Super AMOLED display offers deeper blacks and punchy colours.  Vivo V19 is a great offering for people looking to buy a phone that can click good pictures, offer a great battery life and come with decent processing power. However, if you are looking for more power, you should consider the Poco X2 or the Realme 6 Pro. Both the smartphones not only come with better processors but also offer a higher refresh rate display.  Coming back to the Vivo V19, it is still a compelling option at Rs. 27,990 as it comes with features like 5,000mAh battery, 33W fast charging, 48MP quad-camera setup and much more.
