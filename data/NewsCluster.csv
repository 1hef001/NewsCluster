9,lockdown is easing but many rwas seem not to have noticed,authorities must take strong note of various residents welfare associations rwas that are becoming a law unto themselves since the coronavirus outbreak a gurgaon apartment rwa has demanded that employers furnish covid19 negative certificates before domestic helps are allowed to work india is not in a position to do such frivolous testing moreover the official focus of testing is on symptomatic individuals and primary contacts of positive patients such testing of nonrisk groups could delay testing for those who need it more  many such instances have come to light where rwas frame regulations which make even the stringent terms of the lockdown pale in comparison yesterday a case was filed against a greater noida rwa official for harassment of chinese employees of cellphone major oppo across india many rwas have been accused of violating official norms on distribution of newspapers entry of support staff and even stigmatisation of essential service personnel like doctors and nurses who are at the frontlines of the covid19 fight with cases increasing such siege mentalities could sharpen despite the lockdown easing  these actions betray autocratic tendencies but also fear psychosis and paternalistic mores rwas claim to be leaders of housing societies but they could be hindering the fight against covid19 by setting bad examples of coercion stigma and ignorance instead of hunting for coronavirus among the usual suspects like maids or various groups of minorities it could educate people on wearing masks and even distribute them freely which will go a long way to keeping everyone safer  if it is the fear of sealing government has said 12 positive cases don’t mandate the sealing of an entire office building housing societies can also expect similar treatment the country is in an economic crisis the scale of which only a newspaper can perhaps convey while disabusing readers of fake news but this essential service is denied to many people by overbearing rwas resumption of economic activities with social distancing norms has become imperative for survival of all classes of society rwa leaders who are often society elders must take the lead in this effort  read also oppo alleges bias against chinese employees head of rwa booked in greater noida
10,here’s how you can talk to your partner about your fetish,image by lounis production from pixabay    “tie me up and tell me your dreams”      we wish it were that easy to tell our partners about our fetishes but sometimes the confidence takes a back seat and we end up breaking in sweats dismissing the idea of opening up to our partner don’t worry if you have experienced such a moment it is completely understandable this is something that does require courage as you are opening up about something that you are vulnerable about so to help you here are a few ways that you can talk to your partner about your fetishes    1 communicate your trust  it is best to tell your partner that you find this topic sensitive and it has taken a lot of courage to be open about it you can also tell your partner that you trust them but there is a small part of you that fears that you will be judged this way you are letting them know about your insecurities of being perceived differently and you are hoping that they will be more mindful of their words    2 start small      while you may have the kinkiest fantasies you may also want to go slow when it comes to revealing them and see how your partner is accepting the news moreover try not to joke about it to make the situation light there was a time when i was so nervous about telling my partner about my sexadventures that i added “just kidding” at the end this further confused my partner so it is best to leave the jokes aside and talk about it in a simple manner by revealing your least kinky fantasies first and then breaking the big ones once your partner is in the zone for it    3 try mutual disclosure      if you are feeling a little overwhelmed try asking your partner to talk about hisher fantasies so that you can feel comfortable disclosing yours this way you will feel more confident in revealing your fetish to your partner if you want you both can try writing it down and then exchanging notes  just like all of us experience emotions in our unique way similarly our sexual experiences are also unique to us and having a fetish is completely normal don’t worry your partner will be understanding of your desires in bed besides it never hurt anyone to be creative in the bedroom with consent  also read sex toys are they a boon or bane
11,self reliance not self isolation coining of ‘atmanirbhar bharat’ has started a new conversation on globalisation,india the world’s fifth largest economy could shatter the storied view that globalisation will become the greatest casualty of the coronavirus outbreak  “pull up the drawbridges” that connect the world has become a common refrain in nationalist circles prime minister boris johnson’s brexit and president donald trump’s disdain for multilateral trade agreements come to mind instantaneously nationalist leaders like them have used the coronavirus pandemic to reinvigorate a key aspect of their political agenda – the push for a more isolated world the spread and severity of covid19 have proved to be the perfect foil to reignite fears about open borders and stretched out supply chains  but prime minister narendra modi – long bracketed by a section of the commentariat as a member of the nationalist club – has decided to go against the grain while still pursuing nationalist objectives he’s envisioned a way that does not turn its back on the boundless possibilities of globalisation  the rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package touted as a ‘new deal’ to fashion an atmanirbhar bharat or a selfreliant india we are being told “is a governance and mindset overhaul” in his may 12 address to the nation the pm made it clear that an atmanirbhar bharat wouldn’t be ‘selfabsorbed’ but would rather integrate within the global economy ‘build local to go global’ is the motto  apparent from the pronouncement is a desire to shake off india’s longstanding suspicion of the world that has often made it reluctant to fully integrate with the global economy the government’s spin masters put it thus “we were looking within because we were not confident which spelt disaster for our economy today again we are looking within but this time we are confident that the boundless capacity of our people will help us build our nation and also give back to the world’’  the modi regime’s call for ‘selfreliance’ is very different from the protectionists’ inward retreat being championed by the trump administration and its resulting trade wars designed to pressure us multinationals to bring jobs back home covid19 has only given trump more ammunition to demonise china and disparage globalisation  china has prospered the most from globalisation its success was built on the ‘justintime’ supply chain model that funnels cheap exports and components to thousands of businesses globally because of the pandemic induced lockdowns these supply chains are today disrupted endangering businesses and livelihoods around the world  the effects are even being felt in india where many sectors have ground to a halt for the want of supplies according to a report by fitch ratings manufacturers in india rely on china for 60 of their electronic components scarier still india’s drug regulatory authority says more than half of the active ingredients needed to manufacture antibiotics vitamins hormones and steroids come from china  but to solely blame globalisation or its beneficiaries for the current crisis would be to arrive at a profoundly shortsighted diagnosis a large part of the blame must also lie with multinational corporations what is rarely discussed is that many of their auditors persistently red flagged this overreliance on highly unstable supply chains many businesses happily ignored these warnings prioritising shareholders over prudency the pandemic has only underscored the dangers of standing too close to the edge of the ‘short term business practices’ precipice  yet perhaps a surgeon’s precision is required to mend the weaknesses of globalisation instead of the populist politician’s instinct to throw the baby out with the bath water  it seems the policy wonks on raisina hill have understood this unlike other nationalist leaders that are championing an isolationist response to the covid19 pandemic modi has been guided to opt for selfreliance but not at the cost of rejecting the benefits of the global economy the reformist architecture supporting atmanirbhar bharat seems to want india to be competitive enough in attracting those businesses which feel that the pandemic exposes their overreliance on a single country  but depending on just a vision is not going to be enough for the anticipated withdrawal of multinationals from china or the delinking of supply chains that circumnavigate the globe has not yet happened so if india is to step into the breach and become an alternative global manufacturer announcing reforms alone won’t be enough clinical implementation of policy prescriptions will be key only then can india hope to provide the industrious efficiency of chinese manufacturing and its syncopated justintime supply chains to business investors  fortunately one often overlooked strength of china is something india already possesses in abundance human capital experts have noted that “china is an economic powerhouse not just because of its manufacturing prowess but also its huge internal consumer appetite which makes it doubly attractive to multinationals” indeed the chinese embraced the possibilities of an open market system early on because they saw that the outcome could financially empower their citizenry they weren’t wrong  india is sitting atop a similar demographic tiger modi’s regime is now hoping it can enthuse both local businesses and those spread across the global stage to come together and kickstart on indian soil the virtuous cycle that has lifted others to prosperity in the world
12,misery on wheels with public transport in stasis both jobs and the migrants chasing them are bogged down,bus services have resumed in many parts of the country with limits of 20 passengers at a time transportation is the lifeline of the economy but deciding the modalities of restoring public transport is proving to be a difficult aspect of exiting the lockdown for authorities many cities and border areas are continuing to witness large congregations of migrant workers undermining physical distancing norms and throwing public order into disarray unsafe travel on foot and heavy vehicles is still being undertaken  millions of indians are dependent on public transport for commuting to workplaces and travelling to hometowns and villages as the economy takes longer to reopen it follows that many people out of jobs want to return to the social security accorded by native places the demand for interstate transport stems from this cold economic logic where survival takes precedence over the virus in this scenario the centre with its command over the railway network can ease bottlenecks in interstate transport erected by state governments  the shramik special trains may help receiving states mount greater vigil on incoming migrants but the rationing isn’t helping in social distancing or allaying migrant worker concerns their fear of not seeing home and worries about regaining livelihoods point to the immensity of the shock induced by successive lockdowns and lack of confidence in official assurances restoring public transport including air travel and metro trains to precovid frequencies will reassure all citizens and produce a measure of social distancing with many now avoiding nonessential travel  metro systems in big cities like new york london barcelona seoul and beijing have remained open through the covid crisis although ridership has plummeted indian authorities have in contrast employed blanket restrictions instead of targeted interventions as cases spike states are leaning towards tightening borders serving little purpose other than aggravating migrant distress and delaying economic revival the delhincr belt spanning cities like delhi noida gurgaon ghaziabad and faridabad across three states is in reality a seamless economic zone but border passes are the new reality karnataka’s ban on people entering from tamil nadu maharashtra and gujarat or telangana’s unofficial curbs on similar lines reveal how states will pursue their own lockdown versions in coming days the lockdown wasn’t meant to rob people of their dignity or turn borders into chokepoints mandate masks and social distancing and keep moving
13,amphan strike preparing for simultaneous disasters ought to be the new mantra,in the midst of the covid19 challenge the country has to now prepare for the impending landfall of super cyclonic storm amphan today both odisha and bengal are in amphan’s path as it is expected to make landfall between digha bengal and hatiya islands bangladesh near the sundarbans with wind speeds of 175195 kmph at the time of hitting land amphan certainly has the potential to cause much damage evacuation procedures in coastal areas have already begun with around 3 lakh people moved to relief camps in bengal and another 35000 transported to shelters in odisha plus 41 national disaster response force ndrf teams have been deployed in both states  while cyclonic storms in the bay of bengal are recurring phenomena preparations this time have been complicated due to covid19 for example in odisha cyclone shelters are being used as quarantine facilities for migrants returning from other states in fact there are currently 36200 people under quarantine in 198 cyclone shelters this has forced the state administration to look for additional facilities to house the evacuees add to this the need to maintain physical distancing in view of the pandemic  thus the double whammy of covid19 and amphan will seriously test our disaster response mechanism the lesson here is that the country needs to be prepared to handle two natural disasters simultaneously true no one could have predicted the current situation but with studies showing extreme weather phenomena increasing in frequency over the last two decades concurrent calamities have to be factored in preparedness would go back to empowering grassroots administration strengthening ndrf further and massively investing in public health in this regard the centre’s annual outlay for procurement of equipment by ndrf had been slashed by almost 40 last year such lack of foresight in public safety and health is no longer acceptable
14,‘if you want to understand the next emerging infectious disease you cannot ignore environment or animals’,since 2009 the usaidfunded predict project has worked with teams in over 30 countries to detect more than 900 novel virus species from 145000 samples of wildlife livestock and humans the project was recently extended to help with the current pandemic tracey goldstein associate director of one health institute at the university of california davis which leads the project speaks to vaishnavi chandrashekhar  can you explain the concept of one health  one health is an approach that says you can’t look at outbreaks in people and not also look at what’s happening in the environment and what’s happening in animals so one health teams are multidisciplinary – you have biologists sociologists economists and virologists to look at the problem from multiple angles to understand the complex interactions occurring between human and environment it’s a broader approach to health and not just about outbreaks  do you think this idea will get more traction now  it’s been gaining traction in some sectors especially on the animal side the food and agriculture organization is a partner but it’s an expensive and complicated approach i do think this outbreak is helping more people understand the links between environment and disease if you want to understand the next emerging infectious disease you cannot ignore the environment or animals whether domestic or wildlife  one of the things that has really changed since the sars outbreak in 2003 is how global our world is before we even knew we had a severe outbreak in china there were cases showing up in cambodia thailand nepal and we knew that because our teams were asked to help there the world is so connected now you can get within hours from china to seattle so you can’t think that what’s happening in far flung places is not important and won’t affect us in india or america so we need to invest globally if we can’t strengthen surveillance and response systems in countries around the world it’s going to affect all of us at home  how did the predict programme come about  after the 2009 h1n1 influenza there was an interest in changing the paradigm to think about how to bring wildlife into health surveillance the thinking was to go to locations where people and animals are in close contact and understand how that contact occurs because often that’s where the spillover between animals and humans happens  in the first phase we went to places where teams identified high risk activities where people were working in markets or caves or where roads were being built in places like kathmandu where there was a lot of urbanisation or places like cambodia where there is bat guano farming we also worked with animals targeting primates and bats and rodents in the second phase we saw where we are having lots of positives in bats and rodents and where contact was really high and we went back to those places with a focus on humans  did you find anything related to covid19  we had a study looking at the global distribution of coronaviruses we found more than a 100 coronaviruses 98 of them in bats what we learnt was that there is a really high diversity of coronaviruses related to where we found a high diversity of bats the next thing we found was that there are certain bat families associated with certain types of coronaviruses that’s important because if you can see where those bats are distributed you have an idea of where those viruses are distributed and that helps you when you want to target your surveillance  we did find sarsrelated coronaviruses in rwanda and uganda places people haven’t been thinking about we didn’t find the current sarscov2 in these places we might not have been working in that wildlife market at the time though we did work in other markets also we think that the virus changed whatever it looked like in a bat it mutated and became a pathogen in a human  what have you found in asia  we traditionally think of mers as being in the middle east or africa but we are finding examples of that in southeast asia that means we should be thinking more broadly about those pathogens in asia we found a high bat diversity and along with that a high viral diversity including sarsrelated viruses we’re trying to understand how many of them use the receptor that sars uses to infect humans we’re also hoping to do some work to understand which ones have a broad host range that’s very important for vaccine development we’ve done some limited work in india looking at sick people in hospitals and that has expanded our knowledge of other causes of influenzalike illness
15,booze biz as delhi and other states hike liquor prices with ‘corona cess’ it’s boomtime for bootleggers,two bootleggers counting wads of rs 2000 and rs 500 notes  1st bootlegger this coronavirus and the lockdown because of it is the best thing that could have happened to us  2nd bootlegger you can say that again thanks to the lockdown all the liquor shops all over the country got shut because booze isn’t officially an essential item  1st bootlegger right and when liquor shops were finally allowed to open in delhi and other places after 40 days it became only too obvious just how essential booze is at least to some people as hordes of thousands and thousands mobbed the outlets  2nd bootlegger and then to make matters worse – or rather to make matters better for us – the delhi sarkar decided to impose a 70 ‘corona cess’ on liquor partly to deter overcrowding at vends and partly to raise funds what with other sources of revenue having dried up because of the lockdown  1st bootlegger after which several other states also slapped a hefty corona cess on booze making things even better for us by encouraging us to expand our dhandha across the country  2nd bootlegger yep thanks to the pentup demand created by the lockdown followed by the cess our sales of smuggled grog from places where the cess is lower to places where it’s higher have gone through the roof  1st bootlegger not just any old mamooli altufaltu roof but the roof of the superdeluxe penthouse which we’ll soon be able to buy with the proceeds and the longer the restrictions on movement last the more those proceeds will be  2nd bootlegger that’s great in the global economic meltdown we seem to be the only enterprise making money the only thing that worries me is that some places in the country have oked home delivery of booze won’t that cut into our business  1st bootlegger not to worry our national union of bootleggers will protect our interests and preserve our monopoly of homedelivered booze  2nd bootlegger our union i didn’t know we had a union  1st bootlegger sure we do it’s called the mafia …
16,darling buds of may opting out of immigration is not an option for india or the united states,may in america is commencement month it is the time millions of students graduate from four year high school or four year college to commence studies as undergraduates or master’s some peel off to join the workforce and some just take a break from the rigours of school and college their graduation is marked typically with a celebrity convocation address climaxed by rousing proms and raucous parties it is a joyous moment an american rite of passage for the nearly 20 million students the education system churns out each year the coronavirus lockdown has wrecked this revelry for the class of 2020  among these darling academic buds of may are more than a million foreign students in undergraduate and graduate colleges and universities including more than 200000 from india for them too commencement marks a milestone in an arduous academic journey and often in the case of those who earn a master’s a passage to the job market usually via an internship thousands of parents travel from india to witness their wards’ walk at the convocation ceremony the american education usually funded with their hardearned savings and sometimes loans  although some students return home to india after graduating for the majority the us academic journey is premised on continuing pursuit of the ‘american dream’ their f1 student visa allows a oneyear three years in case of stem students paid optional practical training opt that usually results in a fulltime job typically on an h1b visa separately tens of thousands of skilled whitecollar professionals from india also come to the us on h1b visa for short and longterm projects that often turn into lifelong employment in the us over decades these two streams have combined to form the core of a thriving indianamerican community of more than 4 million people that is america’s best educated and highest earning ethnic group  the pandemic has not only disrupted the annual commencement ritual but also threatens to dismantle the template that led to the formation of this cohort the destruction of the job market that has rendered some 36 million americans jobless has all but destroyed the ‘american dream’ of millions of eventually high net worth immigrants who have made the us what it is a rich vibrant innovative melting pot thousands of students and guest workers are currently in limbo not knowing what the future holds their academic planning job prospects and just about everything including travel plans on hold  their misery is compounded by rising nativist xenophonic antiimmigrant sentiment from a trump base that sees foreign students and guest workers “stealing” american jobs it’s an understandable sentiment in times of despair except this was an undercurrent even before the coronavirus struck there are other issues with this argument the us by itself does not produce enough qualified graduates particularly in stem fields to meet the needs of its industries and corporations the reason microsoft google apple and other companies back immigration is not because foreign workers come cheap a fiction that ignores the fact that the labour department requires certification that they are wellpaid they do it because they need global talent  such a composite internationalist workforce also gives us companies a foothold into new markets the entry of texas instruments hewlett packard and other companies into india in the 1980s was spearheaded by indians working for those companies in america this globalist engagement is lost on nativists in the us and even in india where for the longest time there were complaints about losing its best minds and talent before realisation dawned that “brain drain is better than brain in the drain” india’s investment in human capital in the us and elsewhere yielded unexpected benefits among them foreign exchange remittances that offset the 8 billion spent on foreign education and influencing global perception of india  of course us nativists and critics of the guest worker visa are correct that there has been abuse of the programme unscrupulous body shoppers and companies have manipulated the system and this needs cleaning up but hosting foreign students and guest workers is a net gain for the us and for countries that send their students and workers to america physicist and futurist michio kaku calls the h1b visa america’s “secret weapon” without which the us would be an also ran pointing out that 50 of all phd candidates in the us are foreign born  the salience of immigrants has been particularly striking during the pandemic when they have been on the frontlines according to the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine while 16 of the us workforce is foreign born immigrants account for nearly 25 of physicians and dentists 20 of engineers 235 of computer specialists and almost 30 of scientists  the skills that h1b workers bring with them can be critical in responding to national emergencies argues the american immigration council pointing out that over the past decade eight companies currently trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine – gilead sciences moderna therapeutics glaxosmithkline inovio pharmaceuticals johnson  johnson pharmaceuticals regeneron pharmaceuticals vir biotechnology and sanofi – received approvals for 3310 biochemists biophysicists chemists and other scientists through the h1b programme  so opting out of immigration is not an option for the us or for countries such as india that thrive in a myriad ways on us immigration april was the cruellest month for travel tourism and immigration rough winds did shake the darling buds of may but may june restore reason and sanity
17,for prosperity’s sake government should exit most businesses focus on public goods like health and education,the worry that atmanirbhar bharat abhiyan will equal witless public sector expansion and protectionism has been addressed by the government which is instead planning to limit the role of public sector companies across the economy an important reason for consistently poor governance delivery in india is that government is overextended focussing on public goods like health and education needs it to exit hotels airlines and the jingbang with a few strategic exceptions government has no business to be in business when it wears all the hats of policy maker regulator and corporation this amounts to a conflict of interest which discourages productivity and competition  finance minister nirmala sitharaman has indicated a new policy whereby psu presence will be limited to 14 entities in the strategic sectors while in other sectors government will privatise staterun companies unfortunately in a more conducive market the modi 10 government privatised nothing significant its attempt to privatise air india was halfhearted however unleashing the energies and animal spirits of the private sector is going to be the key if atmanirbhar abhiyan is to succeed in what one presumes to be its goal – although there is lack of clarity and much ambiguity in this regard – making local products competitive in the global marketplace  as singapore’s then deputy prime minister tharman shanmugaratnam had pointed out at the first of niti aayog’s lecture series on transforming india while the country has underinvested in social and human capital it has overreached in regulating the economy and sometimes the stepmotherly treatment to private players makes one nation one regulatory standard a far cry as if this doesn’t make doing business here hard enough longterm regulatory stability is also weak independent regulators and mitigating policy volatility and incoherence will boost india’s attractiveness in the global ecosystem  there are questions about whether india’s covid response has made optimal use of private hospitals as much as public hospitals but the answer cannot be anything other than improved complementariness meanwhile india’s chemicals and pharma sectors have fared better during the lockdown than other industries and their global potential has come under the spotlight or consider the potential of letting private players run trains they could expand upgrade and transform india’s railway network like the entry of competition did to telecom in short thinning down the bloated psu framework would allocate resources more efficiently produce more quality goods and services and put india on the path to prosperity
18,reform who probe covid origin and lay the foundation for global health accountability,with the 73rd world health assembly – the decisionmaking body of who – underway via teleconference the international response to the covid19 pandemic is taking centrestage crucially wha is taking up a motion backed by more than 120 countries including india that calls for a “stepwise process of impartial independent and comprehensive evaluation” of who coordinated international response to covid19 it also calls for the identification of the zoonotic source of the coronavirus and its transmission to human populations true the motion refrains from mentioning china or wuhan but its implementation will necessarily have to include investigation into china’s handling of the outbreak in the initial days  a probe into the origin of the coronavirus is important to understand how it mutated and spread so quickly but china has been objecting to such a probe and even threatened australia with trade repercussions for trying to drum up international support for an investigation in fact canberra has already been hit with a beef strike with beijing suspending imports from four major australian suppliers but with the wha motion getting the backing of a majority of nations china may not have a choice but to go along with it that said the fundamental issue here is who’s limited ability to tackle a pandemic like covid19 the global health body can only issue advisories and has no enforcement powers  this has to change and who should be reformed to play a more active role in preventing global health threats the minimum it can do is ask for annual compliance reports from member countries visàvis health recommendations made by it – something that its constitution already allows with india taking over the chair of the who executive board it should push for new crisis management protocols and give the global health body some teeth covid19 has shown that who can’t remain a soft adviser it must helm a global health architecture that demands accountability
19,how the big bang financial package is the silver lining at the end of the country’s stormy night,the common wisdom goes that for every crisis an opportunity rears its head the most recent pandemic in public memory the spanish flu had sickened gandhiji then an upstart in the indian independence movement the british raj in india was engaged in world war i and didn’t provide food aid or medical help to the indian subcontinent it was under these extraordinary circumstances that many social groups rose up and served society as written in pale rider the finest book on spanish flu it was these social service groups that helped gandhiji in his freedom struggle  the second important event that comes to my mind is president woodrow wilson who after understanding that too much global dependence had made america a victim of spanish flu and world war i announced the “america first” movement to be economically selfdependent that went on to make america a superpower in the next two decades a century later history is repeating itself prime minister narendra modi’s clarion call of atmanirbharta selfreliance is reminiscent of the america first policy the alchemy that actualised the american dream the only thing that needs to be repeated is the country coming together to stand up for “swadeshi” the philosophy behind our freedom struggle thus the slogan “vocal for local”  when the pm announced a package of rs 20 lakh crore a gargantuan 10 of indian gdp it far exceeded the rs 10 lakh crore and rs 15 lakh crore demand of industry bodies ficci and cii respectively one has to draw parallels with the postspanish flu era to understand the transformative power of the financial package like wilson modi has also understood the vagaries of depending on a global supply chain  india as a resilient economy ranks 59th for a country that is fifth largest in terms of gdp this rank shows that we have been following flawed economic principles there are three reasons why india’s rank is that low productivity supply chain and globalisation index our globalisation index is 6225 this means we are consumers in the globalised world and not producers there is need for a paradigm shift to enjoy the fruits of globalisation the rs 3 lakh crore collateral free financial package for msmes will motivate them in converting india into a manufacturing powerhouse  the second problem – supply chain – needs to be sorted out an eu study showed that major postpandemic disruption would be on supply chains twothirds while consumption disruption will be onethird building a local supply chain will not only make us pandemic proof and economically selfsufficient it will also insulate us from future diseases  the third problem – productivity – was not being achieved by msmes as they feared regulatory measures once they outgrew their size thus they abhorred expansion the government announced the biggest reforms since 1991 by changing the definition of msmes coupled with equity infusion of rs 50000 crore into viable msmes it will lead to the formation of a manufacturing delta force of sorts  the government’s decision to disallow global tenders under rs 200 crore will increase their participation in india’s infrastructure story on which rs 100 lakh crore will be spent in the next five years covid19 is very different from spanish flu because unlike spanish flu it isn’t very fatal to the lives of working population  wages doubled after spanish flu but global poverty levels also grew by 97 according to an mit study this dichotomous economic relation was in part responsible for the great depression in the 1930s to safeguard labourers and selfemployed people from the clutches of unemployment rs 5000 crore has been announced for the most affected group the street vendors similarly the announcement of “one country one ration card” is a very big reform to address food security issues during these precarious times  if the rs 17 lakh crore pradhan mantri garib kalyan yojana was the first aid to the indian economy the rs 20 lakh crore atmanirbhar bharat abhiyan is truly the surgical procedure that the country needs
20,everyone’s an expert or a data scientist although it’s never really spelled out how come,if there is anything as alarming as the growing number of those afflicted with novel coronavirus it’s the profusion of desis on linkedin who claim to be experts in data science what growing up used to be called statistics chosen in class eleven over biology by those too chicken to dissect a frog studied from the pages of goon gupta and dasgupta has now been rebranded as ‘data science’ an esoteric subject transformed into a proud linkedin appendage like having a picture on facebook eating lobster and wine at a michelin starred restaurant  and it’s not data science just by itself no there is something extra hanging onto it data science ninja data science jedi data science evangelist data science rockstar though i have noticed never data science pehelwan or data science subedar i don’t know what it takes to be a data scientist that’s never really spelled out in any detail whether it be the ability to find the data button on excel or the knowledge of what median is but all i can say is that if your tagline on linkedin is ‘i breathe data’ and then you believe everything you receive on whatsapp there is obviously cognitive dissonance going on here  and i am not even going to mention other hot tags like machine learning its posh cousin automated machine learning ai and bi which i am told stands for business intelligence because in my days it meant only one thing basic instinct though i do miss the venerable data warehousing a buzzword whose heydays ended around the time shamita shetty’s acting career did  it doesn’t seem to take much knowledge of foundational concepts to spout cliches like ‘data is the new oil’ ironic though that has become considering the price of oil in these covid times like a movie critic anyone nowadays can be a data scientist all you need to do is complete two lectures on udemy and be able to write a ‘hello world’ programme in python but that’s fine the best things in life do not come with a high bar be it love eating rosogolla or watching tv anchors shout at the top of their voice so let’s shun the elitism shall we and allow people to selfidentify as data scientists as they wish  to paraphrase that song from dil ka rishta picturised on aishwarya rai  ‘data data data re data data data re aashiq mere maine tujhse pyar kiya re’

27,why wait,do joyful people find meditation easier to practise than sad morose people is the selfrealisation goal easier to attain for happy people — raj 39 chennai    when we are happy and full of joyous excitement our prana life energy moves upwards this upward movement helps us in our spiritual practice we get better results in our sadhana if the happiness quotient of a sadhaka continues to increase then dhyana is deeper and quicker it is important for a spiritual practitioner to be motivated the yoga shastras say that a practitioner’s enthusiasm is a significant aspect of his sadhana it’s his first step towards spiritual progress if you are not excited about your spiritual practice then it is difficult to make progress on the path if you are sad and unhappy then your prana will soon start waning consequently you will not be able to concentrate this will allow all sorts of disorders to take root in your mind that’s why unhappy people are not able to be successful in their spiritual endeavours    happiness is the prerequisite for any kind of sadhana which is why gurus lay emphasis on satsang    through satsang an individual’s mental conflicts are resolved and he becomes peaceful once he is in a calmer frame of mind he can begin his sadhana just like stale musty fruits and flowers are not used as offerings in religious rituals like puja similarly a drooping unhealthy body cannot help you move forward in your sadhana that’s why it is important to start spiritual practices when you are younger and more energetic and it is even better if children are introduced to spiritual practices so start today for stellar results ■send your questions to steditorialtimesgroupcom with subject line ask surakshit and state your age
28,reformat your memory,  anil k rajvanshi tells us how to stop unpleasant thoughts and memories from affecting us adversely    from my younger days i have had the ability to sense when somebody is thinking about me this ability allows me to react even before the person has spoken or made his intentions known — most of the time with disastrous results    most people now and then do exhibit this ability of reading the mind and i feel everybody has this capability though they may not be aware of it    brain power    the brain is not only an instrument that can create thought but it can also send this signal and receive external thoughts we do have painful memories associated with people places and objects quite often negative thoughts from them bother us    how is the external thought received and is it possible to stop it from affecting us taking the analogy of modern computers or phone apps may provide a possible answer an app in the phone or laptop gets its update notification and data only when the app is on the instrument if the app is removed from the device then no data can be received though that information is in the ‘environment’    similarly if the painful memory of a person or event is removed from the brain then no thought about it can be processed by ithow do you selectively remove painful memories recently scientists have discovered that if we think about a certain person object or event then that memory becomes pliable that is it can be modified with a new memory neural pathways when active are amenable to modifications if at this time happy memories are remembered actively then they might weaken and replace negative thoughtsin a hypnosis session it is commonly seen that the hypnotist suggests new ideas and thoughts to the patient and these get implanted in the brainthis is useful especially when a patient is talking about a painful past episode this way unpleasant memories can be modified with new suggested memories but this is a dangerous process since the other person can play with the patient’s memory and there have been cases of false memory implanted in quite a number of hypnotised patients with harmful results implanting of new memory by oneself is difficultso a better way to do so is to practise yoga and meditation when one is immersed in deep thought on a subject for a long time then the majority of neural pathways in the brain are used mostly to focus on that thought this allows other memories to weaken and provides possible opportunity for removal of unpleasant memoriessanyam deep thought according to patanjali yoga can be cultivated with long practice and is the surest way to make the brain supple then unpleasant memories can be reduced and rendered irrelevantin such circumstances when external thought impinges on the brain then it will not be registered since the memory of that thought app is missing or has become corruptedoften when a virus affects the computer the best way to remove it is by formatting the hard disk weakening of memories by sanyam provide mechanisms in the brain to do just that and this is far better than tinkering with selective removal of memorythe loosening of memory also helps one in becoming detached it is memory that gives rise to attachment either to people or property when memory becomes weak detachment results that is the basic tenet of patanjali yoga darshan ■the author a scientist is director nimbkar agricultural research institute phaltan maharashtra
29,her loyal messenger,here in one more of her short fictionalised mythological stories saiswaroopa iyer writes of agnidyotana’s close encounter with divinity in his quest to fulfil a promise he made to rukmini    the wilderness was daunting agnidyotana clutched his staff his other hand instinctively held what constituted his mission a letter from princess rukmini to the yadava lord krishna vasudeva agnidyotana had been walking for four days now when his feet could carry him no further he sank to the ground of all the people at kundinapura princess rukmini had to choose him an ageing brahmin for this critical task he had stuck to a less taken path to avoid being recognised by spies but the decision had cost him his speed and safety too the wilderness around him did not allow him a good night’s sleep and he was hungry could he reach dwaraka before the stipulated date o why didn’t he choose the path close to the shore friendlier to travellers    “shambho mahadeva help me help rukmini assert her consent lord” he tried to trudge ahead agnidyotana was stuck in a hostile wild patch where even a stray boar could make a meal of him    what happened to the merit of his life — of rituals and sadhana could the gods not rescue him especially when someone’s future hung in the balancedizzy agnidyotana caught hold of the nearest creeper for support he felt the creeper was too soft — it was a part of a net a hunter’s net just then he felt the net descend upon him it meant that he was in an inhabited part of this land perhaps the hunter couldhelp himsoon he heard footsteps and a flame torch lit up the surroundings and agnidyotana saw the hunter “well well if the gods don’t mean to make a cannibal out of me why would a human be stuck in my net”“i need your help brother” agnidyotana did not waste a moment as the hunter helped him out of the net“help me reach saurashtra at the earliest”“gather your breath brahmana” the hunter chuckled“and who in his right mind would venture into this wilderness if not the wild animals hunger would see the last of you forget reaching saurashtra or wherever”agnidyotana heard an anklet jingle a woman in these surroundings he saw the bearded hunter grin she emerged out of what seemed like a narrow path through thickets it hadto be the hunter’s wife frowning at what her husband had just said“running my reputation along with yours to the ground aren’t you what are you a hunter there for if not to kill wild animals” she chided the hunter and then turned to agnidyotana “and the forest has enough to not let anyone go hungry” she beamed and led the way “this man here does not see anything beyond graves and pyres and i belong to a hospitable hill tribe who never lets a guest go hungry” there was something rhythmic about her lilt and the tinkle of her anklets that agnidyotana felt was surrealbefore long they reached an inconspicuous cave that was the hunter’s home and the woman lit a fire to cook a meal “what brings you to these forests brahmana”agnidyotana could not keep a secret from the kind couple who were feeding him in the middle of nowhere still he took care to leave out specifics “a noble maiden has chosen her future lord alas her elder brother thinks he has the power to seal her future despite her resistance i bearher message to her chosen man”agnidyotana saw the couple exchange an amused glance “when this woman chose me the whole world tried dissuading her including me”“ignore him he only meant to test” the woman interjected with a mock frown turning into a smile when her eyes met her husband’s“but tell me good sire your mission seems to concern the affairs of powerful people is it safe for you to get in”“it is the matter of dharma kind lady” agnidyotana smiled at the aroma of freshly cooked gruel “all my life i have been a man of scripture and they proscribe violation of a woman’s consent the gods i worship get angry at the kingdom that insults women i am a purohita and it is my duty to take corrective course of action to save my city from the wrath of gods may they help me in my mission”the simple gruel was tastier than anything that agnidyotana had ever eaten before energising too like he had eaten enough food for a whole week “arise and walk ahead brahmana” the hunter spoke in a tone surprisingly solemn “you cannot afford to tarry”agnidyotana rose as if in a trance and picked up his staff grunts of wild boars ceased to be a concern like the thorny path ahead of him his mind replayed the picture of an anxious rukmini depending upon his success and he strode ahead all night in the wee hours he heard a sound that made his eyes moist with gratitude the sound of sea waves he had reached saurashtra dwaraka is nighseated on the snowy top of mount kailasa the god of gods raised a brow though a knowing smile played on his lips as he turned to the mother of the universe “the distance he covered within a night parvati what did you feed him” ■

32,bring back the experts – how the coronavirus crisis might help stem populism,by adina trunk  simone bunse  there is a spark of light in the current darkness the magnitude and multifaceted effects of the coronavirus pandemic have drawn attention to the need for evidencebased policy responses even some of the most reluctant political leaders are returning to experts and established knowledge to aid their decision making in this time of crisis if experts are indeed back in from the cold and this not just a temporary anomaly this is good news for democracy  ‘britain has had enough of experts’ british mp michael gove famously stated during the 2016 brexit campaign distrust in experts was part of a growing global trend across policy areas from education and health to foreign policy and defense amplified by the election of us president donald trump – a particularly visible critic of bringing in experts  trust had shifted from ‘authorities to peers’ by 2005 and ‘a person like me’ emerged as a credible spokesperson by 2006 according to the edelman trust barometer in the years to follow experts continued to lose credibility failing to predict the 2008 financial crisis or the virulence of the political fallout that followed in addition experts seemed unable to communicate effectively with policy makers or ordinary citizens in an era of sound bites and viral visuals  the dominance of social media further deepened the divide instead of creating a new knowledge era academics lament the rise of ‘narcissistic and misguided intellectual egalitarianism’ stifling evidencebased policy debates citizens bombarded with disinformation from selfproclaimed experts fake facts and false truths have become illinformed cynical at best and angry at worst who reject ‘undemocratic elitism’ but happily consume conspiracy theories  disbelief in the safety of vaccines or in human activity causing climate change are only a few examples similarly some policymakers conveniently sidelined scientific expertise in favour of ‘their own facts’ to push their political agendas  yet it is scientific enquiry and the values upon which science rests that also happen to sustain democratic systems democracy prospers only when it encourages vigorous debate based on ‘reason coherent argument rigorous standards of evidence and honesty’ it is no coincidence that it is the most populist often authoritarian leaders who think they can do without expert input relying instead purely on emotional appeal  the roster of leaders which have ignored or are still ignoring both national and international expert advice to deal with the corona crisis includes brazil’s jair bolsonaro nicaragua’s daniel ortega mexico’s andrés lopez obrador and of course president trump the more prone to populism the leader the greater the chance that the experts will be discredited and the type of rational debate that both science and free societies are based upon is discouraged  but there is hope faced with an unprecedented global pandemic even factresistant leaders are returning to experts both britain and the us adopted much more stringent measures to stem the pandemic after a study by scholars from imperial college london predicted 250000 deaths in britain and over 1 million deaths in the us in the absence of decisive action  policymakers around the globe quickly task forces of scientists academics and legal scholars tasked to come up with national policy options to address the crisis after being discredited or dismissed as superfluous epidemiologic experts including anthony fauci in the us massimo galli in italy christian drosten in germany fernando simón in spain neil ferguson in britain and anders tegnell in sweden have become leading faces in the fight against the pandemic  the key question is whether experts are here to stay and if they will be brought into other policy discussions this will depend on the general perception of the effectiveness of their policy advice this is a daunting test at a time where the enormous social and economic consequences of the coronavirus will undoubtedly need critical evidencebased examination and innovative approaches to kickstart national economies and restore trust in our interdependent global system  open debates from which evidencebased decision making and policy emerge is one of the pillars that sustain democracy public policy decisions are best when generated by diverse teams with both focused experience and broad knowledge diverging national and international assessments are to be welcomed as they enhance critical engagement with the evidence at hand to address challenges the current crisis provides a golden opportunity for us as well as our political leaders to rediscover the value of true expertise trustworthy sources and policy projections grounded in evidence and rational assumptions decisions based on facts and expertise remain our best antidote not only to the current crisis or the next but to sustain democracy and the values that we hold dear  trunk is special advisor international idea  bunse is adjunct faculty georgetown university washington dc us
33,home is where the heart is,who is a migrant this question may never get answered as thousands of young men women and children trudge homewards from the cities where they once worked home for them is hundreds of miles away and they are mostly walking a few are trying to cycle it or hitch a ride they are returning to their villages to escape hunger and penury the odd trucker— if he has a heart— gives them a short lift most refuse for they fear the migrants may be carrying the scary virus the virus that has infected over a lakh of us already the panic is palpable in the lockeddown cities  bustling mumbai looks almost dead  the people who we call migrants today — till yesterday they were construction workers courier boys waiters cooks gardeners shop assistants electricians plumbers hawkers carpenters mechanics – have no money left the few who did lose it to predators on the way people who offered to reach them home took the money and disappeared there are others who died in containers being ferried illegally some were caught by the police and offloaded a few simply died on the way from hunger and exhaustion or were hit by passing lorries a train ran over some sleeping on the tracks at night  a few waited bought expensive train tickets in the hope they would get past milling crowds at the station and catch a train going homewards they will travel standing in packed overcrowded compartments it’s not the virus they are worried about they are wondering if their village will allow them in no one knows for sure for the heartless have taken charge they have taken over india its cities its villages its small towns they are flaunting their power to make life more miserable for those who are going back  we claim to be a superpower we boast of being one of the world’s largest markets an economy that seeks a place among the rich and yet when it comes to a pandemic our boastful leaders are the first to sneak away you see them on tv smugly masked not among the people the only ones doing any work are ordinary citizens who are helping each other and the poor and there are the doctors health workers caregivers risking their lives to save others they don’t go home for days some live in their cars others in hospitals to help keep mortality rates low  yesterday i saw a picture of a policeman beating a doctor i have no idea why i don’t want to find out either it will only enrage me i watch policemen beating migrants for crowding railway stations i am told policemen ask for bribes to look away when migrants cross closed state borders but i also see policemen here working day and night in containment areas in slums to keep people safe many of them are now in hospital recovering this is the miracle that is india wherever you look someone good is always there ready to help  meanwhile factory owners are sacking people builders and contractors are not settling the back wages of daily labour most of those going home had to call for money at 10 per cent a month from the village shylock to afford the journey in such times why can’t our taxes be used to run trains free why can’t our taxes be used to help those who can no longer help themselves i see tired sick men sitting in street corners hungry homeless waiting for death when i offer them money they cry what can money fetch them in a lockdown they need food their clothes are in tatters their dignity in shreds they don’t even know if they are sick who will test them who will allow them inside the big intimidating private hospitals the government hospitals are already overcrowded dead bodies lie huddled in plastic covers next to patients struggling to survive it’s tough to figure out who is dead who is alive  no there’s no dignity even in death there is no one beside you no one to send you off bodies are just being dumped— to be burnt or buried no one is allowed to see them or say goodbye the time for rituals is over many people are in hiding unsure of whether they are sick or not—and frightened of what will happen in case they are old people cower in the shadows hoping no one will come to test them or take them away there is terror everywhere terror and brutal soulsapping loneliness of people who have nowhere to go they know that in times like this not a single rupee from that rs 20 lakh crore stimulus will ever reach them it was never meant to  big plans don’t help small people all they need is food shelter medicines when they are sick and most importantly their jobs protected which brings me back to my first question who is a migrant a migrant is one forced by circumstances to leave home and go to work far away to support his family back home when you destroy him you destroy his entire family – his wife his children his old ailing parents remember this next time you talk of development sending satellites to outer space building armament factories making fancy marinas on the sea or building expansive highways india would be better off with more hospitals trauma centres orphanages old people’s homes the pandemic has taught us this
34,why prohibition makes little sense in covid times,one of the unpreparedfor aspects of the continuing lockdown was the 40day prohibition of overthecounter sale of alcohol to complain about its unavailability while people are fighting for lives and livelihoods would be at best churlish and at worst elitist — such elitism presuming that only a certain socioeconomic section of the drinking classes were clamouring for it a presumption since disproved hopefully by the images of linedup ‘liquor louts’ so in a country that goes impractically ‘dry’ — one just hoards up on every ‘dry day eve’ — tipplers bore national temperance womanfully  true alcoholic drinks were never going to find themselves on any ‘essential goods’ list but as the lockdown continued to grind away the pinch was being also felt by state governments denied their income through excise duty revenues about rs 248 trillion is earned annually across the republic turning off this tap at a time when easy money is tough to find was selfrighteous and selflacerating  displays of social distancing going to the dogs outside thekas since monday may well roil many a singlemalter or cofficionado but these demand throngs were born out of supply shutdowns — something that should have been soberly factored in when invoking temporary prohibition  but drinkers have always been an easy target for the maibaap state not content with gathering ‘sin tax’ — where you pay for the sin of drinking and that money will be well used to ‘better society’ — the state uses both the valid reasoning of additional health expenditure and the less valid excuse of moral turpitude to see alcohol consumption less as a social activity and more as an evil to be dealt with pragmatically  this frowning upon drinking is enjoined in the constitution itself article 47 states that ‘the state shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks’ interestingly the perception of drinking being a bad foreign influence and that the state will strive to get rid of it one sunny day is somewhat mirrored in article 343 after failing to phase out the english language over a 15year period as an official indian language when the constitution was adopted in 1950 it now ‘tolerates’ its continued use as official language  the invisible connection between the english not language but rule and drinking alcohol made by the likes of tilak and gokhale was echoed as recently as in 2016 by chief minister nitish kumar while imposing a total prohibition in bihar ‘i want to make it clear to these englishspeaking people that consuming liquor is not a part of fundamental rights’ he said dedicating the prohibition decision to the ‘rashtrapita’  which is where we can source our maibaap state’s maternalpaternal discomfort with its uneasy sanctioning of indian adults drinking the father of the nation in their 2005 insightful essay ‘poverty and purification the politics of gandhi’s campaign for prohibition’ historians david m fahey and padma manian explore mohandas gandhi’s profound antipathy towards drinkers ‘… he even went so far as to argue that… “in the wake of drinking follow insanity adultery gambling etc it depraves the mind and hardens the heart with cruelty”’  while any prohibitionist’s argument can be used to highlight the correlation between drinking and domestic violence the correlation is made to grow into a cause brawls wifebeating and child abuse are indeed caused by drunken men but hardly by drunken men alone instead of coming down hard on such crimes the correlated cause — in this case drinking — becomes the target the fact that wifebeating can be conducted by a sober man or indeed female members of a family are not made to muddy this ‘equation’  but gandhi’s success in stigmatising a drinking habit as foreign to india stands on less firm legs as fahey and manian point out ‘most indian drinkers were and remain poor illiterate and lacking in political influence’ thereby making prohibition ‘a policy with few political disadvantages… except for the parsis and some sikhs and kshatriyas however indian elites influenced by religion and custom rarely drank alcohol’  fahey and manian refer to a 1951 bombay university study that looked at the drinking practices in eight south gujarat villages at least one family member drank in 80 of lower caste dalit and tribal families 59 in muslim families 75 in upper caste families so in historian david hartiman’s words people like gandhi ‘confused their own elite values with indian culture as a whole’  a call for prohibition threatened to deny significant revenue to the british india administration by way of alcohol sales this made ample political sense for freedom fighters but in 2020 swaraj being attained for a while now goi abstaining from muchneeded revenue bears more than a strong whiff of a colonial hangover something i hope to wake up with minus the colonial bit tomorrow for god and country
35,lift restrictions in all zones by july and just learn to live with corona,india’s lockdown has been eased by dividing the country into red orange and green zones with high medium and minimal infections so far and correspondingly tough curbs on economic activity this can at best be a very temporary measure beyond two or three months it will mean economic disaster without avoiding high deaths optimists hope the disease will peak and fall after june if it continues — as is most likely — the best policy will be to ease curbs even in red and orange zones along with precautions and behavioural changes  given india’s natural crowding in streets and markets plus several people sleeping in one room i greatly doubt the disease can be controlled quickly through lockdowns or zoning besides as i wrote last week global experience shows that lockdowns have caused noncovid deaths to rise almost as fast as covid deaths because of neglect of other diseases postponement of cancer screening and elective surgeries and fear of going to infected hospitals so lockdowns can kill almost as many as the virus  i fear covid19 will continue into 2021 even partial lockdowns for more than a few months in red and orange zones accounting for 88 of gdp can kill most of india’s 60 million small enterprises that sustain millions after july at the latest we should lift all but minimal restrictions in all zones that means learning to live with covid as we do with tb malaria and other diseases while popularising social distancing and masks isolating the aged and using innovations like plexiglass partitions in offices and mass transport  global experience suggests that alcoholrelated deaths are 5 of the total far more than covid is likely to cause yet india has relaxed liquor sales to get extra revenue and the supreme court has even advocated home delivery of liquor beedis are mass killers yet taxed lightly to protect jobs if we can live with deadly diseases like tb and malaria with deaths from alcohol tobacco transport and workplace accidents it may be no riskier to live with covid staving off economic disaster  optimists say india is handling covid well with barely 60000 infections and 2000 deaths against 14 million and nearly 80000 respectively in the us this is because of a later start very little testing and hence a huge underestimation of infections and deaths and maybe some immunity through vaccinations but as testing is rising casualty figures are rising exponentially  what if the virus persists beyond july please admit that the lockdown approach including zoning has failed and so switch to minimal restrictions plus trying for improved social behaviour and innovations to reduce travel and workplace risks  data on industrial production and gdp for the lockdown month of april will come only after a lag the quickest indicator is the purchasing managers index pmi estimating changes in orders of managers buying goods or services a pmi over 50 signifies an increase in orders and below 50 a decrease a bad month typically has a pmi of 49 or 48  but in april thanks to the lockdown india’s pmi for manufacturing crashed to 275 from 518 in march the services pmi crashed from 493 to just 54 a world record low cmie data suggest unemployment soared to 25 even while labour participation fell april was an utter disaster people can make sacrifices and survive with handouts for a few months but not more economic activity must resume  some easing of the lockdown possibly the strictest in the world has begun within graded zones but the red zones create 43 of gdp and even with the new relaxations will be 50 closed the orange zones with another 38 of gdp will be 30 closed since companies even in orange and green zones require components from red zones the economic disruption will remain massive the virus is still spreading fast so economist neelkanth mishra estimates that red zones will expand from 130 districts to 181 the answer can’t be to keep shutting down more and more districts  assuming covid peaks in june followed by a sharp economic revival the imf estimates india’s gdp growth at 19 in 2020 the imf admits that if the disease persists growth could be 3 lower moody’s estimates zero growth anantha nageswaran of the pm’s economic advisory council says the worst case could be minus 3  by contrast gdp rose 39 even in the recession of 2008 yet the resulting bankruptcies hit our financial sector so hard that banks have not yet recovered imagine how badly minus 3 growth will wreck alreadycrippled banks covid panic must not blind us to the consequences of a prolonged shutdown
36,any capital redesign must move towards a participatory culture,at a time when the government should be deeply troubled by the coronavirus pandemic and devising longterm health strategies its inner circles are busy planning the upgrade of parliament house and the central vista but even there the real issue is forgotten in a haze of environmental jibes and accusations of urban malpractice at the core of the proposal lies the critical problem of the misappropriation of culture  when unlikely bureaucratic departments — external affairs agriculture home etc — are allowed to sit side by side with national museums when centres for art mix with government offices the uncomfortable proximity of two disparate intentions leaves culture an unwanted stepchild of the government  the museum was — and still remains — a secondary government institution at the time the central vista was conceived the government was the only instrument for promoting financing and institutionalising public culture the blame for such precedence then lies squarely with edwin lutyens employed as the architectural representative of the british government his plan for buildings along rajpath quite naturally gave prominence to government and bureaucratic functions — the viceroy’s house at the head the secretariat and parliament next door the ministries falling below and further away in receding pockets of shadow culture was fitted as an afterthought – an effort to appease his political masters  the new government proposal merely enlarges the lutyens footprint and gives itself an even grander presence in public space ministry offices will be modernised and enlarged the prime minister’s and vice president’s home will additionally be shifted close to rashtrapati bhavan a new parliament will be constructed adjacent to the old 1912 building new office blocks will be added along central vista to make a more comfortable home for the bureaucracy and culture will be located further afield the proposal sends a clear message public architecture must serve the government better  at the time of the pandemic amid growing social unrest shortages of funds food and medical supplies how can a government justify a rs 20000crore expenditure on a showpiece moreover is such a vast expansion valid at a time when governments around the world are reducing their public footprint  a reverse exercise is currently in progress in england the upgrading of the 1840 british parliament building is intended only to modernise the interior and retain the outer structure in its original form with advanced communications technology available now the surrounding government departments will move out of london to other cities so as to help regenerate local economies shouldn’t a similar exercise be attempted in delhi what value does krishi bhavan’s proximity to the national museum add to public space  in the digital age devoid of paper shuffles between departments the shift of bureaucracy to smaller cities like bhopal lucknow or kochi should be encouraged leaving the entire vista free as a spine of culture given that there is no comprehensive representation of indian culture in a single place anywhere in india the value of such a move is essential  moreover a truly democratic culture must wilfully demonstrate independence from authority and do away entirely with political nomenclature — no more indira gandhi national centre for the arts or the sardar patel museum of science only a national centre for culture an autonomous place free of alignments to political leaders parties or religious ideologies barely a stone’s throw from the seat of government culture then can act as an antidote to political power and thus gain added significance by proximity in times to come its focal location will be critical for free expression  how then do you conceive of culture in such a monumental public space recent exhibits around the world clearly demonstrate that the age of the single museum is gone replaced instead by more engaging technological presentations of objects information and materials streamed in visual sequences as a single mall of culture containing museums galleries theatres craft centres science and technology pavilions the centre should also include an india library in line with the british library and the american library of congress and a significant presence of science technology and medicine in the mix  the design must ensure a participatory experience that gives a true sense of discovery to cultural expression — a place unlike any in india a government that has so far succumbed to western imitations has an obligation to discover a new public architecture for indian culture — something that requires a leap of imagination beyond the straitjacket of bureaucratic regulations
37,okcovid lockdown lust stories are going viral in time of virus,aaaah rejoice… love is in the air…and it is beating the virus let’s unashamedly swoon over the parallel ‘love tracks’ of these two ‘lockdown relationships’ — one featuring a 51yearold world famous londonbased scientist the other an unknown 24yearold delivery boy from turbhe in navi mumbai both are hogging headlines for the same reason — by abandoning all reason during the pandemic and following their hearts  neil ferguson also known as ‘professor lockdown’ shot to international fame when as a government scientist heading sage scientific advisory group for emergencies he warned prime minister boris johnson about the impending number of covid19 deaths in britain hitting 250000  ferguson had tested positive himself and boris johnson’s nearmiraculous recovery made history with a bonus — a ‘welcome home’ gift from fiancée carrie — a bonny baby boy well ferguson is in the news again but not for the state of his repaired and healed lungs alone it’s his racing heart beats and slow rate of brain function that’s hogging headlines last week the celebrated scientist resigned from his prestigious post following a racy personal scandal the kind british tabloids thrive on to put it crudely the eminent scientist who had strongly advocated following lockdown rules staying home and selfisolating was unfortunately caught with his pants down  some spoilsport sneaked on neil’s clandestine tryst and alerted authorities neil had indeed been very naughty he had forgotten his own excellent advice to the nation when he spent two nights with his lady love the rather fetching awaaz staffer antonia staats 38  it gets a tad more complicated since both happen to be married — antonia to chris lucas an arabic professor who speaks several languages and looks like a younger version of neil the scientist and neil to an unassuming lady named kim polgreen the younger couple has two children neil and his estranged wife kim polgreen have a child antonia has talked about her ‘open marriage’ in interviews and admitted the covid crisis has posed an “interesting lockdown challenge” she lives the good life in a 19millionpound home and has joked it’s hard to cope with domestic chores in the absence of a cleaner and an au pair yaani ke like so many of us antonia is also missing her kaamwali bai  we don’t know what kim is going through since she has decided not to comment on the saga which has all of britain hanging on to every salacious detail neil and antonia met on the okcupid app — which makes them sound like teenagers desperately seeking love  the question posed by colombian nobel laureate gabriel garcia marquez ‘s brilliant first published in spanish in 1985 tome ‘love in the time of cholera’ simply asks “is love a young person’s sole prerogative” critics argue that the book presents a ‘reality of marriage’ and argues that lovesickness is literally an illness a sickness comparable to cholera cholera can be interpreted as a disease or a passion and readers can draw their own conclusion  ferguson’s supporters point out that the scientist had indirectly saved thousands of lives with his early warning and that he is ‘only human’ critics have torn into his ‘hypocrisy’ and challenged his explanation where while admitting he had ‘undermined the lockdown’ he also added that he had acted on the belief that he was ‘immune’ after selfisolating for a fortnight meanwhile antonia is reportedly telling friends she thinks her husband is covidpositive and ‘had it’ let’s see where this goes bechare neil ka bajaa diya for sure  closer home an equally foolish and lovestruck delivery boy figured he couldn’t live without his 24yearold partner a nurse who was 500 kilometres away stuck in her parents’ village home and set off to get her back he hitched rides starting on april 27 and finally reached her village on may 3 reunited and euphoric the lovers set off for navi mumbai on may 4 but once again someone mean sneaked on them and tipped off the cops as they stopped for lunch in lanja ratnagiri where they are now in quarantine  unfortunately so are 34 others including the girl’s parents who came in contact with the love birds the lockdown spares nobody — from mighty scientists to hardworking delivery boys the hefty price of love desire and unbridled passion has to be paid neil ferguson described his illtimed liaison as an ‘error of judgment’ poor excuse mate scientists know the precise weight of such phrases however he has done the ‘honourable’ thing according to supporters by resigning from his post it will be interesting to monitor how many more highprofile personalities err romantically when it comes to their judgments neil’s is but the first case to go public i am rubbing my hands in anticipation someone a little closer to home we all love lockdown lust stories

60,cashstrapped india’s economic plan unlikely to soften coronavirus blow reuters,new delhi india’s 266 billion economic rescue package rests mostly on boosting company credit but contains scant new public spending tax breaks or cash support to revive demand and prevent firms from collapsing business leaders and economists say  businesses from airlines to small stores are reeling from prime minister narendra modi’s nearly twomonth lockdown of india’s 13 billion people aimed at limiting the spread of the new coronavirus many firms say they won’t survive unless they are bailed out immediately  the government said on sunday it would privatize staterun companies in nonstrategic sectors and stop fresh insolvency cases for a year  but apart from that its plans entail a mix of easy loan schemes a bit more money for a rural jobguarantee program and a slew of longawaited policy reforms across sectors that will take effect over the mediumterm  combined this is not enough of a boost to prevent a likely 5 contraction in asia’s thirdlargest economy in fiscal 20202021 goldman sachs said on monday it said it expected the economy to shrink an eyewatering 45 on an annualized basis in the quarter to the end of june  business leaders are unimpressed by the government’s response  “we are creating all sorts of liquidity for supply but what about the demand” said kiran mazumdar shaw chairperson of biocon limited one of the country’s top health firms  “demand is going to play a very big part in economic revival and if we cannot kickstart demand i fear than we cannot have economic revival i think we have lost a big opportunity” she said  a breakdown of the rescue plan shows that the actual spending of the government is only about a tenth of the 266 billion package which modi had hailed as 10 of india’s gross domestic product in line with the big stimulus plans announced by other major economies  a large part of the rest of the package is actually loans provided by banks many of them without collateral leveraging 105 billion of liquidity provided by the central bank government officials said  “we would not qualify it as a stimulus package … only 1 of gdp is given to compensate for the income loss which is not likely to be sufficient ” said sunil tirumalai of brokerage emkay global  one percent of gdp would amount to about 29 billion – and the government may well spend even less than that as it fears a sovereign rating downgrade  govt ‘has limited resources’  two government officials said the government estimates total spending of 27 billion from the budget this year towards the rescue measures which would prevent the fiscal deficit from widening more than 100 basis points beyond the target of 35 of gdp  the finance ministry must also assess the scale of intervention required if the coronavirus pandemic drags on for longer than currently expected officials said  “we do not know how the situation would evolve or how long it will go on for we need to prepare for that as well as the government has limited resources and needs to spend wisely” said one of the officials who did not want to be named  distress is mounting across the economy emkay estimated the cost of the lockdown at around 170 billion overall  indian airlines are taking an average daily loss of 10 million12 million and will need extra funding of 325 billion350 billion rupees 43 billion46 billion in the next two years according to ratings agency icra a unit of moody’s  airlines have been cutting staff and wages to avoid defaulting on debts to their lessors or banks even as their fixed costs such as servicing and parking fees keep mounting  the government has also provided no support to the tourism industry which is likely to see tens of thousands of job cuts and small firms going bankrupt the federation of associations in indian tourism  hospitality said  and a fifth of the 70 million retail traders who form the bedrock of modi’s political support may go under because they are unable to pay wages and rent  with the lockdown now extended to the end of may only one thing seems certain the road back to economic health is going to be long and hard  “a steep fall in output this year is certain and we continue to believe that the recovery will be slow” said shilan shah from research firm capital economics
61,corporate social responsibility and the way ahead,the dramatic spread of covid19 disrupted lives livelihoods communities and businesses worldwide it showcased to us how today truly we are a connected society india’s response to covid19 was swift with the country going into lockdown in the third week of march with relatively low number of covid positive cases the lockdown meant a nearcomplete restriction on the movement of people the closure of all establishments except those providing “essential services” and the regular “sealing” of neighbourhoods and areas that are suspected to be covid19 hotspots several corporates immediately responded to the crisis by shifting their factories to produce what was needed by the frontline corona warriors especially the healthcare workers corporate csr teams mobilized resources to provide muchneeded food ration and emergency income support for daily wage earners who had lost their livelihood as a result of businesses having to close this was our first line of defence our attempt to bring relief to those impacted by the pandemic this is an unprecedented crisis and while corporates and civil society responded in the best way possible it still wasn’t enough  the covid19 outbreak affects all segments of the population but the health and economic impacts of the pandemic are being borne disproportionately by the poorest a case in point is that of the migrant labourers wherein we are witnesses to heartbreaking images of pregnant women elderly men  women carrying their children on their shoulders and backs as they walk on foot to reach their villages never mind that their homes are hundreds of kilometres away this is a better alternative to being confined in a small shanty with shared unhygienic toilets increasing their risk of being exposed to the virus  this pandemic has magnified inequalities and is no longer restricted to just a health crisis as it morphs into a social crisis amongst the most vulnerable are women and children quarantine measures imposed as a response to the covid19 pandemic have led to a heightened risk of violence for them in their own homes as they are cut off from essential protection services and social networks the economic burdens faced by families due to the outbreak can put girls at greater risk of exploitation child labour and genderbased violence global lockdowns imply lock downs on girls’ autonomy reinforcing the discriminatory attitudes and practices that regard girls as secondclass citizens and hold them back  our experience of working with girls from underprivileged backgrounds leads us to believe that indian parents of adolescent girls will be particularly hesitant to send their girls back to school exacerbating the already high school dropout rate for girls and increasing the risk of exploitation  early and forced marriages the aspirations of indian girls are however quite different as is evident from one of the surveys done by us called the tag teenage girl survey which showed that over 70  wanted to go in for higher studies while 74 were keen on pursuing a career and even had a specific career in mind you can access the complete report here httpswwwnanhikaliorgpdftagreportpdf this shows the potential our country stands to lose out on if we do not support these girls  it is amply evident that policy makers must look at girls as a separate constituency not only to ensure their protection and safeguard them from genderbased violence but also to invest in their education as this would have far reaching benefits for our nation  there is promising news that scientists across the globe are working on a vaccine to stop coronavirus and some clinical trials have already begun it is now more important that the fallout of the crisis be addressed from the immediate emergency covid relief operations there is now a crying need for csr teams to go back to the drawing board and ask themselves the following questions which communities would be most vulnerable in the aftermath of the pandemic how do we prepare these communities to develop the skills required in the post pandemic period  having understood that though girls are not the face of this pandemic they risk being amongst its biggest victims it is imperative today more than ever before that girls have access to quality education else we risk further widening the existing inequalities what is even clearer is that digital skills are a prerequisite to survive in the post pandemic era  this of course has led to even more questions the most pressing of these questions is how to impart digital skills to a community which has no access to computers or the internet we are working on solutions to offer personalized learning program to the girls to ensure that girls are not left further behind as we emerge from this crisis  as the world and india work towards mitigating the crisis it is vital for us to prepare for the next phase of response and shift from our current obsession with the pandemic csr professionals now have the opportunity and responsibility to revisit their priorities and focus on causes that will help us build a stronger more resilient and more equitable india post the lockdown it is equally important not to abandon support to not for profits who have been addressing the preexisting serious health and social issues in our country  we are determined to double our efforts to support girls and investing in their digital empowerment will be our new “normal”
62,rising share of preowned car segment in india,the new car sales have seen a steep decline close to 19 drop in the last financial year this is the biggest decline car makers have seen since the economic meltdown in 2008 the manufacturers are struggling to sell their cars due factors like the economic slowdown the mandatory switch to bs6 and excess production  on the other hand used car industry is booming and registering double digit growth year on year more and more buyers are opting for preowned cars over new ones this is mainly due to the presence of organized used car players who are present in almost every major city in india the organized players have changed the way india buys and sells used cars  buying and selling used cars a decade ago was not easy as today because the ecosystem was highly unorganized and one wasn’t sure where to buy a preowned or how trustworthy the purchase would be questions about the price of the car condition of the car documentation etc always existed among buyers this left them with no option but to choose new cars over preowned as buying process was comparatively simple  the times have changed and the used car industry is going through a paradigm shift in how it transacts thanks to the expanding network of organized used car players who have captured the trust of buyers in a short span with their easy and transparent car buyingselling process and more importantly offering affordable preowned cars to consumers from all walks of life  according to cars24 estimates the size of the used car industry is 13 times the size of the new car market and is expected to touch 25 billion by 2023 in other words used cars accounted for 55 of total 75 million car transactions in india and as per forecast used cars will account for 75 of total transactions in india by 2025 as is the case in us  other mature markets more than doubling from current 42 million to 9 million transactions a year  interestingly millennials have been the driving force behind the booming preowned car market according to cars24 data in 2019 out of 4 million potential used car buyers who showed interest on our platform 22 percent were millennials out of those almost half of the buyers were found to be first time car owners  the millennial today seek value for money – you can buy a wellmaintained suv or a luxury car in the budget of a brandnew hatchback and the depreciation rate of these are way lesser than that of the new car so even when you are selling the used car a few years later you do not take incur a massive loss as compared to new ones and the millennials are making a smart choice  the used car industry has the most to make out of the mandatory switch to bs6 as the rule clearly has no restriction whatsoever in selling or buying of used car post the deadline in fact even the older bs norms vehicles are not affected by the rule over and above consumers who have delayed the decision of buying a brand new bs6 car in 2019 will likely to make purchase once the lockdown is over this will further fuel up preowned car market our data suggested over 50 of customer’s sell their older car while buying new car  used car prices generally depreciates anywhere between 2035 percent in the first three years then continues with a rate of 510 percent every year depending on the make and model in the case of the phased out bs4 models an additional 1015 percent depreciation is a possibility a consumer might also have the fear of not getting the right value for the car once the bs4 sales are stopped  be it buying or selling used cars the dealers the used car companies are all set for make some serious bucks and with the current economy the price difference between an old bs4 car and its bs6 variant will be massive and the gap will lead to more buyers opting for preowned cars  for preowned car buyers bs4 cars will be a great option to buy with bargain deals as the same make and model of bs6 cars will cost 510 more the price gap between a used bs4 and a brand new bs6 is going to large as the driver or a car owner there is absolutely no difference they can feel between the bs4 and bs6 cars in terms of performance or fuel efficiency  the highest used car transactions were recorded in mumbai delhi and bangalore in 2019 we have also rapidly expanded and made our presence in tier 2  tier 3 cities that lacked organized players  the demand for used cars in the tier2  tier3 has seen a steady rise over the years according to our data in 2019 out of 63 used car purchased from metro cities like new delhi mumbai bangalore etc 23 were purchased by buyers from smaller indian cities  affordability is a major factor when it comes to tier2 and tier3 cities with a higher supply of used cars from bigger cities in the near future the price of these cars will be more affordable than ever making it a bargain for buyers in smaller cities and hence leading to a new class of firsttime car buyers
63,coronainduced cuts shouldn’t mar army capabilities,most of these proposals have come to our knowledge through media reports and while we may not know the fine print the overall thrust is clear there is an attempt to find ways to alleviate some pressure on the already stressed defence budget that could see a further coronainduced reduction the idea is laudatory but we must also not lose sight of the longterm impact of decisions taken today on the overall effectiveness of the military  looking first at the proposals concerning the ‘men’ or our human capital of men and women in the military two schemes under consideration are the increase of retirement age and the introduction of a threeyear ‘tour of duty’ in the indian army  the chief of defence staff general bipin rawat recently announced “we are soon bringing a policy to extend the service profile of the men and have an increased minimum retirement age” as the defence pension bill was becoming “unsustainable” with this proposal almost onethird of the military personnel would retire at the age of 58  this is a practical move given the much better physical and medical standards that our soldiers enjoy today extension of service would prevent a premature haemorrhaging of trained and experienced workforce particularly in technical services there will also be a positive effect on the pension bill  the army’s proposal on the ‘tour of duty’ needs a more serious deliberation the army’s internal note has cited a “resurgence of nationalism and patriotism” and the “rising unemployment” to propose a threeyear “internship” for those who “do not want to make defence services their permanent vocation but still want to experience the thrill and adventure of military professionalism” with this scheme the indian army seeks to save on the training pay and gratuity costs of a regular officer or soldier  in my view this proposal raises some fundamental questions about the very character of the profession of arms the military service is a vocation a higher calling and a way of life where selfsacrifice is the highest duty it should not be considered a place for adventure and thrill seekers or a steppingstone for lucrative corporate careers i have no doubts about the motivation of the young men who will join this “internship” but putting inadequately trained officers and men in combat situations is unfair to both them and their comrades  every nation has its unique military challenges and comparison with other countries that follow a two to threeyear conscription model would be inappropriate in case we require some young talent in specialised areas for a temporary period we could suitably modify our existing provisions for short service commission and territorial army  the reference to patriotism and nationalism in the army note was utterly unnecessary walter berns in his book making patriots defines patriotism as the devotion not only to the country but also to its principles and equally importantly an understanding of these principles donning the uniform is not the only criteria for displaying your patriotism it is also a reality as many studies have shown that the primary motivation for soldiers in combat is not some higher national ideal but the cohesion of your small unit and the trust in your comrades  turning now to the ‘machines’ in giving a push for ‘make in india’ general rawat asked the military to stop “misrepresenting our operational requirements” and accept indigenous weapons even if they met “70 percent of the specifications the military ideally required” there is no doubt that india is one of the biggest arms importers in the world and this fact is a severe matter of concern selfreliance in the defence sector is an absolute imperative if india is to become a truly global military power  however this will require substantial structural reforms there is a need for policy changes to encourage the private sector by financial support and preferential treatment over foreign vendors no company will spend crores in developing weapon platforms if there is no guarantee for purchase by the government there should be a complete revamping of the defence public sector undertakings and an overhaul of the defence research and development organisation which have shown little innovation in high technology areas  asking the military to accept weapons that do not fully meet the operational requirement only because they are produced in india is dangerous in a life and death situation a soldier’s best friend is his equipment i have heard many frustrated soldiers express their anguish when their grenades would not explode or the rifle jammed during an encounter with terrorists  the problem of inadequate quality is even more critical in equipmentintensive services like the navy and air force when a pilot is flying a singleseater fighter aircraft he is highly dependent on the performance of his machine lord moran in his classic work ‘the anatomy of courage’ writes “when i ask a station commander what strengthens the resolve of his pilots he answers ‘always leadership’ and then after a pause often adds ‘and the quality of their equipment’”  the senior military leadership undoubtedly needs to deal with the challenges posed by the size and shape of the defence budget however in finding solutions it must be ensured that the efficiency of the force remains unimpaired
64,emerging scenario in coronainfested india  abroad,while china is consistently elevating its profile with the massive showoff of its amazing military power accompanied by the aggressive and imperialist assertions not only over the south china sea but in the entire indopacific beijing’s continuing missile tests in today’s critical times with failed attempts to intrude into india’s air space in the northern sector are a particular cause of concern not only for the us and india but also to the whole world it has once again underscored the fact of eastward shifting global geopolitics in the world through the pandemic has already led to engender several geopolitical changes which may considerably influence to possibly alter the prevailing international hierarchical order  unfortunately the us is indeed suffering the worst trauma despite being blessed with the latest and advanced medical facilities and eminent team of doctors but the epidemic is still much more far beyond its control and its megacity new york in particular is witnessing the disaster recording the highest number of deaths of the soinfected patients each day indeed the individual loss to the us is much greater than that of any of the western powers and much more than that of the causality occurred in the earlier axis power’s attack on pearl harbour during the secondworld war which america may find hard to digest this is why perhaps washington has placed its army on alert mode to preempt any unforeseen eventuality emerging due to beijing’s mounting expansionist aggressions particularly over the south china sea  though china is increasingly being condemned by the us as the original source of the virus that is manufactured in its wuhan lab of virology but beijing is accusing to washington for the same in its counteroffensive although the real culprit as regards producing the virus is still unknown yet china has now agreed to face the world health organisation’s inspection into its wuhan lab of virology but only after the ongoing pandemic is over interestingly this wuhan lab is considerably financed by many foreign powers in the west including the us amidst the ongoing pandemonium wherein france is also being accused as the probable source of this virus india has fortunately emerged as a potential torchbearer of humanity and human values again in the east by extending its humanitarian helps like supplying medicines to many mighty powers like the us england germany etc and also sending its doctors to neighbouring countries in south asia viz maldives and sri lanka  while the global pandemic due to coronavirus has vigorously shaken the entire world most of prominent global and major powers like russia england france italy belgium spain mexico ukraine brazil including china suffering again the trauma of reverse corona attack are today passing through perhaps the worst phase with consistently rising numbers of covid19 infected patients and a significantly large number of resultant deaths among them everyday that may lead to a realignment of global powers including regional powers and smaller states so as to forge new arrangements or even alliances as a conducive international order this may go along economic and politicohegemonic lines wherein liberalcapitalist forces may unite under the global leadership of the us with china getting cornered due to being possible coronavirus maker and russia making frantic efforts to regain its lost glory as a distinct global counterpole  although prevailing hierarchicalinternational order may remain unchanged due to america still occupying the unquestioned hyperpower status due to its insurmountable global military power yet china’s consistent ascendance in the international economic field may lead to the possible decline of the us’ influence in global affairs that may attract several major regional powers to rush for capturing the seat of unique global predominance and may possibly witness a major clash of interests among the soaspiring powers for the global hegemony this may result into a new or thirdworld war involving nuclear weapons resulting into nuclear holocaust engendering perishing of millions of millions of innocent human population and precious properties  as against this with chinese influence gradually receding in global affairs due to mounting us ledwestern powers’ pressure to isolate its economy facing severe economic sanctions and even limited military counteroffensives particularly for liberating the south china sea from chinese presence ensuring uninterrupted passage through maritime channels the emerging scenario may become difficult for both china and pakistan – in not getting the much needed economic and military support from global financial institutions like world bank and softlone agency imf and major arms traders like america france etc respectively – to confront bharat’s rising clout in the world fortunately new delhi may now become a new destination for many west european countries which are now going to wind up their massive investments in china including many prominent financial magnets like japan france germany britain and also the us  notwithstanding all these concerns the covid19 will inevitably lead to new doors of socialcultural economic strategic and defense cooperations and also scientific and technical research between and among countries to overcome the postcorona national and global scenarios it has already engendered significant changes in the common styles of exchanging courtesy where shaking of hands and other prevalent modes in different nations are increasingly being replaced by india’s welcome gesture with folded hands followed by mandatory social distancing and declining social gatherings the consequent scenario due to covid19 may witness considerably reduced socialinteractions and community celebrations of massfestivals and marriages etc for a long time to come thus a radical change in human and social behaviour may change the ensuing cultural patterns in the coronainfested india and also most of the world that obviously underscores the fact that nothing is beyond human endeavour
65,long awaited agricultural reforms bring cheer to the sector,finance minister mrs nirmala sitaraman made some significant announcements today which will bring transformational changes to the agricultural sector given the fact that agriculture is a state subject this effort by the centre is commendable  the first one is the proposed amendments to the essential commodities act many economists have been recommending this for many decades scrapping this obsolete act would have been ideal but the deregulation of most of the agricultural commodities and scrapping of the stock limits has created a similar impact this will make it possible for large and small private players to purchase agricultural commodities on a large scale this will increase competition and will make it possible for the farmer to realize better prices this is fantastic news of course the government will always keep the power with itself to interfere in case of a national emergency which is fine but this is a step in the right direction  amending the agricultural products marketing committee act apmc has also been pending for a long time looks like political alignment is difficult for all the states to amend the apmc to allow free trading of agricultural commodities across mandis and states the control for this was in the hands of the states so now the centre has come up with a solution which is the second reform  the central government will bring a law that allows for inter state trading and movement of agricultural produce the new law will provide a choice to the farmer to sell produce at attractive prices and he will not be bound to sell to exploitative traders at the local mandi this will remove barriers to free interstate trade and will help the farmer in realizing a better price this is a good solution the devil is in the detail but the intent seems to be right  this measure will have limited success unless it is backed by availability of digital platforms that allow farmers to sell their produce all over the country there is no doubt that promoting digital platforms that provide market access to farmers to buy inputs and to sell output will go a long way in eliminating middlemen and in better price discovery for the farmers  there are many digital platforms for trading agricultural produce which are operating in different parts of the country some of them have gained significant traction it would be better if the government carries out an assessment of those platforms and creates a national grid of such platforms with government’s own enam so that a comprehensive solution is available to farmers all over the country  it is still an unfulfilled requirement to allow futures trading in agricultural commodities this has not been addressed in this announcement farmers should be able to sell part of his crop in futures trading to cover his costs so that he is never in a distress situation this is how it operates in the western countries we need to see a similar situation here too we hope to see this in the near future  contract farming is another area which will allow farmers to tie up with corporates for a contract production of desired crops this needs to be scaled up with necessary policy support to give desired benefits to the farmers the third reform announced today deals with facilitative legal framework to enable farmers to enter into contracts with processors aggregators large retailers etc in a fair and transparent manner this helps in liberating the farmers and gives them freedom to tie up their production in advance at an advantageous price enforcement of contracts especially with farmers is a problem in india if the market price is lower than the contracted price the buyer will end up with more volume than the  contracted one and if the market price is higher the buyer will not get the contracted quantity this danger always exists in spite of the best intentions of the government  digital quality assessment is important when we want to promote on line transactions through which farmers can sell their produce standardisation of quality parameters across the country and providing digital tools to assess quality of agricultural produce on line are important for the success of this initiative there are some new digital agritech start ups who are providing this facility it might be necessary for the government to bring such agritech start ups into a network with the digital market place applications  apart from the above reforms the announcement today dealt with a financing facility of one lakh crore rupees in building a farm gate infrastructure this is a welcome move although it is only a financing facility being provided to fpos and primary agricultural cooperatives agri entrepreneurs and start ups and not an investment by the government the farmgate infrastructure is desperately needed to increase farmers incomes village level cold storage facilities and cold chain infrastructure envisaged under this programme will go a long way in providing a stable base which the farmers can use to discover a better price for their produce this can dove tail into the third reform of attracting corporates into entering into forward contracts with farmers while one lakh crore is not adequate to cover the full country it is a step in the right direction  overall this is a good effort it is still not enough to travel the full distance but it is a step in the right direction this is a bold reform the real test lies in developing the rules of each of the laws and in the finer details hopefully the bureaucracy will help in making this a functional and result oriented effort and not lose its efficacy in complicated rules  after a long time we have had a positive effort from the government for the agriculture sector we should welcome this in spite of the possible shortfalls we may have in achieving the full objectives
66,a health crisis correcting health of indian agriculture,one of the most famous presidents of the united states john f kennedy during his campaign speeches in 195960 used to often employ the chinese word for crisis that is “composed of two characters one representing danger and the other opportunity” this famous quote appears to be operating in india right now during the fight against the ongoing pandemic around covid19 the government of india’s recent announcements under atmanirbhar bharat selfreliant india initiative seems like seizing all possible opportunities while “reviving and rebooting” the economy by containing the dangerous impacts of corona virus the latest tranche of measures for the farm sector of the economy under the 20 lakh crore package offers very optimistic and positive impressions ​​  immediately after the nationwide lockdown was announced in late march this year government of india declared a package of 17 lakh crores mostly to protect vulnerable sections from any adverse impacts of the pandemic the slew of welfare measures besides targeting the disadvantaged sections of the society included benefits for the farmers such as the advance release of rs 2000 directly to the bank accounts of farmers under pmkisan scheme the special scheme under pradhan mantri garib kalyan yojana provided benefits such as additional grain allotments cash assistance to women shg members additional wages to nregs workers etc a moratorium of three months for debtservicing of agricultural term and crop loans was also announced  during this period of lockdown initial disruptions of the agricultural supply chain were reported in few parts of the country however with the relaxation of restrictions for the farm sector large scale hueandcry has been averted in parts of india sale of perishable fruits and vegetables has suffered in specific instances due to inefficiencies in supply chain management marketing of surplus agricultural produce in mandis harvesting and procurement operations have fortunately remained nearnormal because of proactive measures taken by many state governments the bumper harvest of wheat and other food crops besides the prediction of a normal monsoon for ensuing rainy season has definitely kept the spirits of indian farmers high  to revive the indian economy so unexpectedly hit by the covid19 pandemic hon’ble prime minister of india while addressing the nation gave the call for atmanirbhar bharat self reliant india besides advising the citizens to fight the health crisis through specific advisories government’s intent on various sectors with an overall package of 20 lakh crores 267 billion usd has been announced by the finance minister recently the third tranche of government announcements under atmanirbhar bharat initiative announced on 15th may has entirely focused on the agriculture sector it is indeed a package that was long overdue as the initiatives reforms and the benefits declared have often been suggested by experts to revive the agriculture sector and to raise the income of farmers significantly as envisaged by the government’s aim to double farmers’ income by the 75th year of india’s independence  the eleven measures announced on agriculture and allied activities are divided into two broad areas eight of them relate to strengthening infrastructure and logistics and three relate to governance and administrative reforms while the first set of measures include rs 1 lakh crore for the agriinfrastructure fund rs 10000 crores for the formalisation of microfood enterprises mfes to promote “vocal for local with global outreach” rs 15000 crores for animal husbandry infrastructure development fund and allocations for marine inland fisheries and aquaculture with development of required logistics promotion of herbal cultivation and beekeeping expansion of operation green to all fruits and vegetables top to total many of the schemes announced in the recent years’ budgets have also been expanded in scope in this package  however announcements in the governance and administrative reforms category have been notable and historical these include amendments to the essential commodities act 1955 to enable better price realisation for farmers agricultural marketing reforms by formulating central legislation removing interstate agricultural trade restrictions and enforcing quality standards and price assurance of agricultural produce through a facilitative legal framework  at the centre stage of agricultural policy changes announced is the deregulation of agricultural commodities from the essential commodities act and various restrictions on the sale of farm produce under various apmc of various states in fact agricultural economists and experts have been advocating for these reforms for years together especially before each of the annual budget exercise but for no avail the regulatory provisions like the stock holding limits restrictions of exports even during a bumper harvest etc have gone against the interests of farmerproducers while skewed in favour of the consumers these longpending reforms are also expected to pump in private sector investments and modern capital into the sector as market dynamics would operate creating competition amongst actors in the chain while ensuring better price realisation for farmers  the announcement relating to the agriculture marketing reforms will provide vast options to farmers to sell their produce to traders of their choice at any in place of licensees instead of the compulsion to sell farm produce only in apmc yards dominated by the middlemen to address this the central government has announced to bring legislation freeing barriers on interstate trade during the ongoing pandemic few state governments have already made amendments to their respective apmc legislation permitting farmers to sell their produce from homesatellite mandis like designated warehouses at the minimumsupportprice msp it is no secret that apmcs in states are often dens of political patronage and therefore a strong political will from states as agricultural marketing is a state subject and specific incentives from centre may speed up the reforms process in desired directions government of india has already suggested a model agricultural produce and livestock management aplm act 2017 to the states wherein states have been advised to make relevantcontextual modifications suiting to interests of their farmers  the third significant policy measure suggested is on the agriculture produce price and quality assurance centre has now assured to create a facilitative legal framework with an aim to ensure quality and boost agricultural exports the announcements of these measures on longpending reforms agenda in the agriculture sector are bound to cheer everyone the only reforms agenda missing in this package is that of land leasing legislation land revenue is a state subject and a volatile matter for the political economy legalising land leasing is expected to bring much needed private investments to the sector besides taking care of genuine interests of lessee cultivators or tenant farmerssharecroppers perhaps this reform agenda is left to proactive state governments to fill the gap and come forward to show political maturity  the slew of agricultural reforms measures under atmanirbhar bharat is indeed extremely timely and a good implementation would make the sector a reliable growth engine for the nation’s economy nobody would have ever thought that the health crisis around corona would offer opportunities to correct the health of indian agriculture

109,study suggests that unless there is herd immunity weather change cant curb spread of covid19,the next time someone says maybe the summer heat will curb the spread of coronavirus you can refer to this study according to new research by princeton university climatic conditions wont affect covid19 transmissibility  the study says that warmer weather alone cannot restrict the spread of the deadly virus until and unless larger populations develop immunity from future outbreaks  the study which was published in the science journal says our findings suggest without effective control measures strong outbreaks are likely in more humid climates and summer weather will not substantially limit pandemic growth  medical science  the study came to the conclusion that in the current rate of infection of the virus climatic conditions are changing next to nothing global populations are still at the risk of contracting the virus  the researchers model is based on data related to similar viruses that have occurred in the past like influenza human coronavirus oc43 and human coronavirus hku1 they used simulations in three separate situations to find out how the pandemic would respond to different climates around the world  by doing so they discovered covid19 will behave in the same manner in different climate sensitivity as compared to the other viruses  the studys results suggest that the virus had a mitigating effect only when a large chunk of the population had already developed some sort of immunity to the virus presently such a scenario does not exist in the case of covid19  afp  lead author of the study dr rachel baker said we project that warmer or more humid climates will not slow the virus at the early stage of the pandemic the virus will spread quickly no matter the climate conditions  the research added that once an adequate part of the population is immune to the virus the disease will start behaving like other human coronaviruses which usually occur in winter season  the researchers also believe that the course of the virus over the next few months will mainly be influenced by other factors like socialdistancing immune response and its strength and duration among the people  afp  several researches are taking place which are studying the immune response to the novel coronavirus
110,worldrenowned biochemist rapidly finds covid19 antibodies from plasma to accelerate cure,in the pursuit of coming up with a way to defeat the novel coronavirus scientists have identified multiple antibodies from covid19 patients  discovered using a singlecell analysis method these antibodies could possibly neutralise the virus in a human body  representational image  a new study published in the journal cell uses highthroughput singlecell genome sequencing for identifying the antibodies from convalescent plasma a component of patients’ blood scientists in the study note that such antibodies can be successfully used to treat viruses like ebola aids and mers  the study has been conducted by sunney xie a noted chinese american biochemist and the director of the beijing advanced innovation center for genomics at peking university and his team xie is widely considered to be the founding father of singlemolecule biophysical chemistry and singlemolecule enzymology  x sunney xie image academic tree  xie told afp that the drug resulting from the studies has been successful at the animal testing stage “when we injected neutralising antibodies into infected mice after five days the viral load was reduced by a factor of 2500 said xie that means this potential drug has a therapeutic effect he added    the drug is based on a recovering patients’ plasma that contains neutralising antibodies produced naturally by the immune response xies team isolated these antibodies from the blood of 60 recovered patients the use of the resulting drug has led to a clear improvement of both mild and severe covid19 patients the study notes  this process of isolation of antibodies however is a slow and tedious process scientists have to screen for monoclonal antibodies mabs  potent neutralising molecules from the immune system’s b cells the existing methods for this as per the study are not an ideal response for a global health emergency  covid 19 antibodies from plasma  this is because only some b cells produce antibodies that are capable of neutralising the virus the researchers hence call for a more rapid process to screen for those cells for the required immune molecules    that is exactly what the study is aimed at in the study researchers demonstrated a rapid and efficient singlecell genome sequencing method to identify specific b cells that produce sarscov2 neutralising antibodies in recovering covid19 patients  “we showed that highthroughput singlecell sequencing could lead to the identification of highly potent neutralizing mabs that have strong therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy” the scientists noted in the study  the antibodies identified through this process were then tested and it turned out that they could indeed neutralise the virus clinical trials for the same are now underway  with inputs from pti and afp

119,chronicle of a pandemic foretold,  the coronavirus pandemic has prompted people to recall a number of functional scenarios that narrate apocalyptic events one of the best known of these is stephen king’s 1978 magnum opus ‘the stand’ which in its fulllength version runs into 1703 pages and deals with a deadly pathogen which kills over 98 percent of the world’s population    perhaps one of the earliest fictional accounts of a global threat that wipes out all forms of life is arthur conan doyle’s ‘the poison belt’ which features the scientific genius professor challenger and was written in 1913    from the astronomical data he has collected and analysed challenger deduces that our planet spinning through space is shortly to pass through a zone of ether a gas commonly used by the medical profession of the time as a general anesthetic which can be lethal as an overdose    with his warnings falling on the deaf ears of a heedless officialdom challenger decides in the true spirit of scientific enquiry to shut himself up with a couple of his close associates in a hermetically sealed room in his sussex house    according to the calculations he has made the world should pass through the ether belt within a span of 24 hours or so    by keeping himself and his companions safe from the effects of the gas for that period of time challenger wants to prove to his own satisfaction that he has calculated correctly and that the planet would transit through the ether in 24 hours if he has miscalculated when he and his friends unseal the room and breathe the outside air – for they have no intention of staying locked up in indefinite isolation – they will also inhale the gas and perish along with all the other inhabitants of the planetat the appointed hour challenger flings open a window – and they breathe in clean fresh morning air the poison belt has been safely passed the small band of survivors ventures into london and sees people carriage horses lying on the roadside crashed automobiles with dead drivers slumped over their steering wheelschallenger and his companions face the terrifying prospect of being the only living beings in a dead worldthen slowly the ‘dead’ humans and animals begin to stir and come back to life the ether rendered them unconscious but did not kill them though there were fatal accidents such as car and train crashes the human race survives as do other living speciesthe book ends with challenger summing up the nearextinction as a somber warning from the cosmos to humankind which in its endless quest for greater and greater technological advancement and its desire to dominate nature oversteps the boundaries of its own limitations and becomes a threat not only to itself but to all lifechallenger likens the poison belt to a disinfectant that the creator in the role of a watchful gardener used to cleanse the grape of planet earth from the undesirable fungus of human arrogance and lust for powerit’s a haunting image which more than a century after it was evoked is all the more relevant in the context of the coronavirus pandemicexcept this time the poison belt it not out there it’s within us what disinfectant not just of the body but of the spirit can be devised to exorcise the toxin withinthat’s the real challenge
120,how to connect despite physical distancing,how each of us copes with lockdowns social distancing and workfromhome routine – to prevent further spread of the covid19 pandemic – will vary from person to person some will be anxious stressed panicked or fearful others more accepting and peaceful however what we feel radiates out affecting others so what can we do to lessen the stress how can we enrich our sense of community without physical contact    i will share with you here a very potent form of communication – the ability to connect hearttoheart – that works despite physical distance we can send love from wherever we are to anyone anywhere anytime    sit comfortably and gently close your eyes bring the person you wish to send love to in front of you feel your heart connecting to their heart gently send love and care to the person from your heart to their heart feel connected    the news is full of stories of tension between couples between children and parents and between the elderly and other family members    how can we face the cabin fever we are experiencing during the lockdown perhaps this being together is an opportunity to accept each other’s imperfections and strengthen our emotional connections today our human community is global – and viruses of course don’t respect national boundaries – yet many of us are lonelier than ever this is a chance for us to reboot ourselveswhy not read one chapter of a book together and have a discussion we have time now to work on our lifestyle choices digital technologies are important for us to stay connected but we can also take breaks from screen time and cultivate more family time enjoy a song or meditate together watch a movie share meals and tell each other jokes when family members meditate together it forms a very strong and deep bond the connection joy and humour we feel will dissolve the pain i am not trying to deny or downplay the severity of the current situation – we need to accept reality and act accordingly do not ignore the cautionary guidelines already in placeexperiment with lifestyle choices there are so many habits that could simplify our lives like conserving groceries fasting and being careful about finances rather than indulging in panic buying there are also many tasks we normally don’t find time for at home like springcleaning we can explore our creative talents learn new skills and cultivate healthy habits we can help our elders and those who are less fortunate we can be kind to others and volunteer in our communities while being careful to prevent spread of the virus especially during a lockdown a regular daily routine will be immensely beneficialif you would like to experience inner stillness peace and joy take refuge from the outer world in the stillness of your heart your heart is the doorway to a world of wonder and wisdom feeling and connection heartfulness practices offer protection in your energetic structure even if they are not a remedy for everything when we stay connected in the heart prayerfully we create a vibration of love around us when we purify our consciousness we dissolve the negative thought pollution around us let this unusual and challenging time be an opportunity for every one of us to recalibrate our lifestyle  the writer is raja yoga master and president shri ram chandra mission and heartfulness institute    disclaimer  views expressed above are the authors own
121,is your cough infectious,psychologists say that 90 of our activities happen as a result of selfhypnosis a man coughs and suddenly many others start coughing until now you were sitting quietly there was no trace of any coughing but one man coughs and you are suddenly reminded of coughing with that reminder hypnosis catches hold of you and your throat begins to itch now you are bound to cough this was a suggestion it functioned like a spell and now you will follow it    psychologists also say that the role of germs in this situation is secondary the role of hypnosis is primary that is what makes people sick or healthy your body functions in obedience to the commands of your mind even now at this very moment if the body falls sick it is only because it is obeying the mind and when it is healthy it is only obeying the mind when it becomes old it is only obeying the mind in living and even in dying it has your full agreement and command when old people die the deep reason behind it is that the moment they start getting old they start wishing for death young people don’t usually die and the basic reason behind it is not their youth the reason is that they don’t think about dying    death is less of a physical phenomenon and more of a psychological onehindu scriptures have called this maya hypnosis whatsoever you are doing whatsoever you are whatsoever your mental state is all your hypnosis if you are happy if you are unhappy it is all your hypnosis but your unawareness of it makes it very difficult for you to change it if someone is unhappy and you tell him that he is only hypnotized about being unhappy he will not agree with you because he cannot change itbut if you try some experiments with hypnosis you will be amazed if you hypnotise a person and then put an onion in his hand and tell him that it is an apple he just might eat it and say that it is an applethis ability of the mind is called maya in this hypnosis the world that people create together is almost magical the world that we are living in is our own magic we are crying and weeping and screaming in pain or this happiness is happening and that joy is happening and this trouble and that difficulty… it is all your own magic and the key to it is in your own hands  abridged from the flight of the alone to the alone osho times international courtesy osho international foundation wwwoshocom ■
122,new doorway to introspection,instead of feeling stifled under the lockdown shammi paranjape suggests we take this opportunity to do some soulsearching    with lockdowns isolation quarantine and social distancing being practised all over india and also in some other parts of the world in the wake of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic this is a good opportunity to make full use of seclusion to go in from out to do this is possible only in stillness and seclusion and by force of circumstances nature has though in a harsh and relentless way brought us to it we need to utilise this time for introspection and soulsearching    the primary principle of nature is balance when this balance is disrupted there is temporary chaos and readjustment also as human beings we have failed in our moral duty to the planet now we are forced to do it call it the law of natural ethics when a tipping point is reached a power mightier than all the combined strength of humankind starts operating    our disconnect with our higher self made us ignore our responsibility towards two deadly ‘viruses’ that have already been raging for a while on our planet these are virus of ‘excesses’ and the virus of ‘hunger’    deadly as these viruses are they have got scant attention    the hungervirus or virus of the poor afflicts and kills millions thousands starve and go to bed hungry whereas some among the affluent throw wasted food in the garbage bin minimal effort has been given to mitigate this callousness against humanitythe other virus — excesses brought on by ‘affluenza’ — has upset the ecological balance to earn a decent amount for family and self to lead happy and healthy lives is the common goal of all people but somewhere the equation has gone askew enough is never enough as greed has taken over leading to imbalance and degradation of the environmentit is being reported that the current pandemic was possibly triggered by mishandling of and consumption of unusual animals like bats if this is true then it is perhaps a good time to rethink what we eat sri sathya sai baba says “your body is a shrine not a burial place for innocent animals”he further elaborates that humans are no longer cavemen who need to hunt for meat to consume it for survival we have come a long way and have changed many of our habits to suit the need of the times he further says that consuming the flesh of animals passes on negative qualities and also the fear animals experience when they are slaughtered many healthy eating options are available this being the case why eat animals ■
123,corona karma,acharya gyansagar and monk anita didi discuss corona karma merit and traditional hygiene practices with sonal srivastava    we often come across the comment ‘corona is karma’ on social media the phrase loosely refers to human actions as being responsible for the coronavirus pandemic the virus spiral reportedly began in china where bats are consumed as food in such a scenario it becomes imperative for us to explore the ancient karma theory in the current context one among the three main karmic religions in the subcontinent jain dharma accepts karma as a yardstick of the natural justice system and has a welldeveloped philosophical structure that helps us understand how karma works    “there is individual karma and then there is collective karma collective karma that is all our karma put together influences everybody when we do good deeds as a society then we also reap collective merit it is our collective paap karma negative actions that we are being affected by coronavirus” so says anita didi monkdisciple of acharya gyansagar who is presently camping in baran a town in rajasthan    “we have to try to understand the jain karma siddhanta principle    we get fruits according to the karma we do and the intention with which we perform actions rishis have said that there are kashayas passions desires that result in our manifesting anything in this world their intensity varies they can be tivra fast or madhya medium kashayas” says gyansagarji explaining the different aspects of the jain view of karma “our suffering depends on the tenacity of our kashayas and our individual karma each one of us experiences suffering differently to get over one’s bad karma one has to do pashchatap penance merit can be accumulated by worshipping tirthankaras and by contemplating on their teachings the most important thing is to have karuna bhava compassion towards all living beings and to do seva in whichever way we can” says gyansagarji talking about ways to accumulate merit “we must also ask for forgiveness if knowingly or unknowingly we have hurt somebody” says the master as he reiterates the jain principle of kshama forgiveness kshamavani is an annual jain festival during which followers of jain traditions publicly ask for forgiveness of everyoneto stay safe during the current pandemic gyansagarji says that we must stay indoors wash our hands frequently with soap and water and make sure we keep them clean“we should ensure that we eat healthy saatvik food” he addsanita didi emphasises the importance of purity in jain dharma particularly when it comes to matters of hygiene “leaving your footwear outside before entering the home washing hands and feet several times a day especially before meals — these are all personal habits encouraged in all jain households these traditional practices only enhance the quality of life and now their relevance is being greatly felt by all”gyansagarji says that to overcome our bad karma it is vital to have atma jnana knowledge of the soul the body is just like a mobile phone without the battery the phone can’t workif karma is central to the existence of every being then what about the karma of the coronavirus — isn’t it accumulating a lot of bad karma “coronavirus is only a nimmitta medium through which we have to account for our bad karma we have to use our viveka intelligence and make sure that we perform actions without ego or sense of doership remember mahavira’s teaching — live and let live” ■
124,corona is here but where is karuna,the grave crisis that has developed worldwide due to the spread of a tiny invisible virus reminds me of the samudra manthan story the mythological churning of the milky ocean continuous churning went on for centuries in which devas and asuras both participated in the hope that great gifts would emerge instead suddenly a dark and deadly poison the garala emerged and spread worldwide devas and asuras fled in terror and it was only when shiva karunavataram the incarnation of compassion collected the poison in his hands and swallowed it thus containing it in his own throat which turned blue hence his name neelkanth that the churning continued and great gifts began to appear    if we consider the violent churning that the human race has indulged in over the last few centuries – the ruthless exploitation of nature the cruel destruction of millions of plant insect and animal species pollution of air earth and oceans the unsustainable high protein diets and consumption of strange animals and reptiles has at last thrown up a new garala that threatens the very existence of the human race    perhaps this is nature’s way of telling us to slowdown worldwide for a while so as to enable her to regenerate which she seems to be doing rapidly during the human lockdown periodto expect shiva to appear once again and contain this poison is to say the least unrealistic nonetheless we urgently need the compassion he embodied so that together we can meet this challenge this must extend not only to victims of the virus but to those millions whose lives have been uprooted in the process the sight of lakhs of migrant workers desperately trying to walk hundreds of kilometers to get back to their villages was heartrending have we seen a countervailing upsurge of compassion shakespeare’s immortal words in the merchant of venice are apt “the quality of mercy is not strained it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven  upon the place beneath it is twice blest  it blesses him that gives and him that takes”that is the karuna we need the present crisis has taught us that firstly despite attempts by several world leaders notably president trump to trash globalization the fact remains that in any major worldwide crisis we will all sink or swim together the ancient indic ideal of vasudhaiva kutumbakam remains validsecondly it shows that our basic health infrastructure remains woefully inadequate ‘sharir madhyam khalu dharma sadhanam’  the body alone is the foundation for all dharmas unless we triple the percentage of gdp that is at present allotted to health and education we will never be able to safeguard the welfare of the weaker and most vulnerable sections of society a restructuring of our national priorities is long overduethirdly this crisis has given us the opportunity to stay home look within and develop our intellectual and spiritual capacities regardless of which religion we may belong to we have to find within ourselves springs of compassion –karuna – that alone will be able to confront this deadly corona challenge we do not need large congregations just quiet prayer and meditation are much more effective as the upanishad says “within the furthest golden sheath resides the immortal brahmn that effulgent light of lights that is what the knowers of the atman know”
125,take this quiz and see how you fare,  humanity is taking a common reentrance test cet with the entire country in a lockdown the coronavirus pandemic is testing us as persons — personally and professionally personal test refers to management of our thoughts body and spirit professional test relates to dilemmas we face at work in any sector whether government private or selfemployed how we react or respond to the pandemic stems from who we were before the pandemic struck    this invisible virus attack has taken everyone aback no one imagined that we would need to practise physical distancing  being termed ‘social’ distancing  and live in fear of the person next to us someone you may have hugged shook hands with shared a meal with or even prayed with is now to be avoided in proximity    personal domain try to answer honestly the following questions    are you in control or in panic are you scaring people are you offloading your stress on others are you securing things for your basic needs or are you hoarding are you being helpful or inaccessible are you sleeping well are you looking at the time on your hands now as a rare opportunity or are you wasting it sulking are you willing to learn something new or you think it is too late    are you bonding with family and friends are you comfortable in your own company are you watching what you eat and drink do you have a fitness routine are you doing what you always wanted to do or are you waiting impatiently for the lockdown to end are you choosing your news sources for information or are you bingeing on doomsday predictions sensationalism and rumours are you expressing gratitude for what you have or are you waiting to settle scores are you a source of joy and help in the home or are you a pain do you share household chores and moreprofessional domain are you in command and control of your own responsibility or are you looking for an opportunity to pass the buck to someone else and absolve yourself of all responsibility are you staying well informed so that even by a minor intervention things may get betterare you audio or netconnected to colleagues or are you unavailable are you finding fault or working out corrective measures are you appreciative when something went right are you looking out for areas of strengthening the system once normalcy returns and more    we live in extraordinary times of unforeseen dimensions where we have to first protect our own physical space before we protect others we are surrounded by ‘an invisible enemy’ with power to invade even our tiny ‘space’ at any time whoever we may be with neither vaccines nor cures we need to take all precautions possible to avoid infection hence the need to conform with recommended guidelines on prevention    we need to also take care of our mental health keeping ourselves constructively occupied staying calm perhaps with the help of spiritual practices like meditation good reading and good listening    it’s both an external and internal challenge the world will never be the same once we emerge from the current crisis we need to reset our priorities and lifestyles as is being pointed out ‘planet earth is closed for repairs’    the same is true for us human beings as well    kiran bedi is lt governor of puducherry  
126,protect yourself from the fear contagion,  in the housing society where i live fear as well as common sense are prompting most residents to stay indoors but in the process they inevitably consume more and more doomsday scenarios being telecast 24x7 that tend to aggravate rather than assuage the fear factor this can lead to terrible mental agony for those who are neither strong nor confident enough to stay unruffled    jacebdebiec who teaches psychiatry at the university of michigan usa says “there’s a pandemic of fear unfolding alongside the pandemic of the coronavirus… watching or hearing someone else who’s scared causes you to be frightened too without necessarily even knowing what caused the other person’s fear”    not all fear is bad because of fear we safeguard ourselves from many dangers and risks “fear contagion can serve a valuable survival function” points out debiec “the reaction to perceived danger is fright freeze flight or fight we human beings share these automatic unconscious behaviours with other animal species”    the problem is of paranoia “robust social transmission of fear” has become ubiquitous despite our claim to being more intelligent than other species    fear of death tends to cloud rational thinking fear of hunger and poverty is very real for daily wagers which is why tens of thousands of poor migrant labour has sought to flee to reach their homes to be with family they had no idea where their next meal would come from and what they would do without work if only their fears had been addressed in time and they were assured of food and shelter they may have stayed put assuaging fear in times of crisis is vital otherwise the consequences can be fatalfor those of us who have the privilege of not having to stress about the next meal fearbased on facts and the growing numbers of virus victims may prompt us to take preventive action but fear itself ought not to become another more dangerous contagion that might make us even more vulnerable one of my neighbours refuses to step out onto her balcony for fear of getting infected she spends her entire day wiping down doorknobs and latches light switches and table tops scrubbing and dusting and so on with the result that she is a quivering bundle of jangled nerves jumpy and terrified though her home is now squeaky clean her family members walk around the house with trepidation treading on eggshells as it were for fear of alarming the lady who is utterly stressed out i hear she is now learning to meditate chant and even sing with the help of specific apps all of these seem to be having a positive effectthe rest of us are simply hunkering down working from home following recommended protocols waiting for the virus crisis to pass on blue skies clean air birdsong – the change is unimaginable in so short a time with commuting suspended and factories shut except that one cannot ignore the tragedy of so many succumbing to the disease globally and others losing their livelihoodsit is more important to transmit useful information about safety security and arrangements for basic needs to be met rather than repeatedly sound alarm bells about the virus only then more people will calm down and also begin the process of containing the fear virus as well

136,best train ever made in india trail blazing train 18 could be a game changer for intercity commuters,vying to match stateoftheart trainsets running in europe or japan the indian railways’ new genre train codenamed ‘train 18’ signifies a “major leap in technology wholly developed by our engineers” as minister piyush goyal said in his recent interim budget speech the growing global trend favours trainsets for medium and high speed trains implying a set of coaches coupled mechanically and electrically with driving cabs at both ends and distributed traction power across the train conducive to quicker turnaround at terminals faster acceleration energy efficiency and operating flexibility  as a ‘make in india’ initiative the integral coach factory icf chennai turned out this first of the programmed ten semihighspeed up to 160 kmh trainsets to progressively replace the intercity shatabdi express trains in his own words the just retired icf general manager s mani led a key team “to harness their technical chutzpah to design and manufacture the best train ever made in india matching world standards … and do it well before december 2018 and hence the name train 18”  beyond the concept of a new generation world class train on ir the project obliged mani to pugnaciously follow up to secure ir board’s sanction then motivate his team to successfully roll out the first trainset with 80 of components procured indigenously within an incredible 18 months that too within the estimated cost tag of rs 100 crore  a 16 coach rake with all its power equipment underslung provides optimum seating capacity of 1128 – in two executive cars 12 second class coaches and two motorised coaches combining functionality and aesthetics speed with safety and service with style the avantgarde train has a striking modern look along with highend amenities and conveniences comparable to if not better than an aircraft – including digitalised sliding doors and footsteps emergency talkback unit cctvs wifi gpsbased information screens lcd tv on executive class rotatable seats zero discharge vacuum based toilets intelligent air conditioning  the t18 project has generated new confidence in ir to set its sights high and to explore export possibilities as semihigh speed 150200 kmh trainset can be a costeffective alternative to highly costintensive hsr systems 250350 kmh a project to develop acquire 15 trainsets aluminium bodied energy efficient including some with sleeper coaches is also on the anvil to replace the present rajdhani rakes hopefully ir board will pursue the project with alacrity  ir faces the looming shadow of competition not only from budget airlines but also from modern highcapacity buses as well as personal cars covering intercity distances notwithstanding some sporadic launches of new branded trains such as tejas humsafar antyodaya uday ir has demonstrated little concerted strategy to expand accelerate and modernise its passenger business  firstly ir needs to acknowledge that a rigid bureaucratic structure is antithetical to business ethos it must shed its widely and mistakenly perceived role of a departmental undertaking with public service obligation and instead perform as a corporate entity oriented to customers secondly it may well restructure its passenger and freight businesses as separate profit centres for specialised and focussed attention  thirdly its debilitating pricing structure needs to be immediately addressed the second class ordinary train journeys constituted 786 of ir’s total passenger traffic in 201617 yielding just 167 of total passenger earnings narrowing fare gap between airlines and railways has been a catalyst for the switch from trains to airlines ir must not outprice itself in the “upper class” segment it is presumed it has done due diligence while fixing the vande bharat express fares at 14 times the basic fare for economy class on shatabdi express and 13 times for executive class  again the slow stopping “regional” services contribute the maximum loss in passenger business and consume scarce movement capacity an autonomous corporate entity under the ir umbrella will be well placed to deal in this segment of rail business with a clear focus coordinate better with respective state government authorities and provide for multimodal transport  the real importance of ‘t18’ lies in lessons it holds for frugal engineering project management and empowering managers who dare dream big hopefully this story of gumption guts and grit will spur ir management to break the mould of their perceived ineptitude and pusillanimity it needs to heed how some of the most successful companies faded into irrelevance – because they remained complacent failing to adapt their businesses and structures to brewing market disruptions trends and technologies
137,life death crime kidney rackets underline the urgency of repairing india’s organ donation ecosystem,fruits of crime can outweigh its risks by a tempting margin so masterminds of a delhi kidney transplant racket busted in 2016 have been found running a similar racket in kanpur while they were out on bail underground kidney syndicates exploit the enormous demandsupply gap luring poor donors with a meagre sum and extracting an exorbitant one out of the receivers overall the organ allocation system is perceived to be corrupt such lack of trust also keeps it from growing as needed  the situation is far from ideal even in exemplar states tamil nadu has received the union health ministry’s best performance award for organ donation four times in a row with its transplant authority transtan maintaining a registry of patients in various hospitals and allotting organs of brain dead patients to deserving patients but there have been controversies about how organs are being allotted to vips out of turn in any case organs have been retrieved from only around 1200 patients indeed of the nearly four lakh people needing a kidney transplant across the country only around 8000 get it a key reason is that 90 of kidney donations here come from a living donor but elsewhere a majority take place after death  india needs a major uptick in cadaver donations to reduce the demandsupply gap raising awareness is obviously necessary but this needs to be backed up by widespread availability of suitable medical infrastructure such as the necessary surgical skills for removing and transplanting organs and the facilities for speedily moving organs to where they are needed states like haryana punjab and himachal pradesh have very few retrieval centres which keeps the organ donation rate forcibly low death can give life if our organ donation ecosystem is overhauled
138,how can twitter be better by taking a stand and being open about its choices rather than affecting neutrality,recently twitter was summoned to explain itself to a parliamentary committee because some rightwing handles felt they were being downvoted and rendered less visible this has been an outcry among us republicans too who accuse the platform of “shadow banning” muting a person’s content without their awareness  twitter says that its algorithm is only responding to behaviour signals – like how often an account is reported blocked muted liked and so on so it’s simply that spreading too much negativity has backfired on some highprofile handles  meanwhile those who spoke out against the targeting of kashmiri citizens in the aftermath of the pulwama terrorist attack have been subjected to intense concerted abuse journalists like barkha dutt have been sent detailed death threats and explicit pictures  when a swarm descends on one person the effects can feel catastrophic and crazymaking but twitter had been reluctant to react to this organised assault – instead its main grouse was dutt sharing a picture of male genitals that was sent to her as abuse  so what is the platform expected to do everyone resents twitter everyone expects better of it this is what happens when a little microblogging site which began with no bigger aim than chirping about your day to your friends ends up becoming the pulse of humanity the global public sphere itself  it’s now crucial to politics for ideological warfare for politicians to brand themselves and create a direct emotional bond with their voters it shapes the news it has linked and boosted protest movements and counter publics it has pockets and folds of brilliance it is also a partisan echochamber a fount of fake news and a place where women and minorities pay a high price for being vocal and visible it is time for twitter to decide whether free speech means unfettered anythinggoes speech or speech that allows everyone to converse without fear  remember that only five years ago we were still talking of web 20 as a participatory utopia we celebrated our new networked possibilities the destruction of intermediaries exulted that anyone could organise revolutions “at the click of a mouse” silicon valley companies cast themselves as innocent platforms for free speech as neutral as post offices any government that wanted to regulate them was seen as meddling with our freedom and our technological destiny  and then the epistemic crisis revealed itself – slowly it sunk in that social media had helped create a posttruth chaos the cracking of reality into separate partisan worlds free speech it turned out was also cover for a lot of disinformation propaganda zombie armies of bots – a tidal wave that could destabilise politics maybe even turn elections social media companies could not escape responsibility the handsoff technocratic pose was no longer tenable  platforms are not blank slates or open stages things don’t go spontaneously viral platforms actively organise what is seen and hidden they are “intricate algorithmically managed visibility machines” writes tarleton gillespie cornell professor and tech scholar in his book custodians of the internet about the hidden decisions that shape social media he argues that content moderation is not a side activity it is the fundamental thing that platforms do  they have three ways of doing this editorial review community flagging and machine detection editorial review is done by human judges a few employees at the company and a large number of outsourced crowd workers community flagging is when we the users point attention to problematic content and it gains from our specialised grounded expertise and capacities but it is subject to our vagaries machine detection though image or word filters is still being refined  all of these are easier said than done – whether it is blocking terrorist material or graphic violence or abuse it’s one thing to state the principle and another to draw the actual lines which are often ad hoc informed by past experience or future trouble so instead of hiding behind mysterious algorithms social media platforms would do better to define their values and what sort of public conversation they want to foster  platforms curate and shape what we see for instance twitter chooses not to insist on real names which protects political dissidents but also facilitates trolling it sets rules that determine what can trend often platforms play with light and shadows problematic posts are hidden in certain geographies and visible in others this may seem like good strategy but it also leaves them open to the charge of opacity and duplicity  perhaps as gillespie says the solution lies in more open editorial responsibility and not less rather than saying it’s just the algorithms platforms should be more open about what human and institutional choices dictate the algorithms don’t try to be all things to all people make principled judgments and then reveal those judgments  right now these platforms are sticky – to leave is to sacrifice one’s public presence so even those who complain bitterly about twitter are stuck with raging on it this situation is not permanent but twitter needs to make its priorities clear now – will it stand up against the systematic abuse of those who defended fellow citizens or will it be intimidated by those fouling the discourse it’s a stark enough choice
139,indiansaudi tango mbs commits to antiterror cooperation among other bilateral positives,with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman’s mbs visit to india coming on the heels of his visit to pakistan and the pulwama terror attack carried out by pakistanbased terror outfit jaishemuhammed one surmises that prime minister narendra modi pressed upon him strongly india’s concerns on pakistan as the region’s terror hub at a time when india is trying to diplomatically isolate pakistan mbs offering islamabad 20 billion in investment was jarring for new delhi however saudipakistani ties have a history that cannot be wished away on the other hand it’s welcome that riyadh under mbs’s leadership is looking to diversify its strategic engagements and sees new delhi as a reliable partner  while one positive from mbs’s visit was that he offered new delhi intelligence sharing and cooperation overall he took the relatively anodyne position that terrorism and extremism are common concerns meanwhile modi emphasised that the two countries had agreed that terrorism would not be supported in any form and that pressure should be brought on countries that back terror although there was no mention of pakistan by the two leaders this is the closest that the joint statement got to sending a message to islamabad  if there’s one country with even more influence in pakistan than china it’s saudi arabia and the saudis do not have an interest in containing india the same way that china has the best case scenario would be if riyadh could privately persuade the pakistanis to give up the terror tool – in which case riyadh’s refraining from public criticism would yield fruit in the meantime bilateral cooperation on other fronts should move apace it’s welcome that new delhi and riyadh inked five agreements during this visit including mous on saudi investment in the national investment and infrastructure fund tourism cooperation and broadcasting  missing was the deal to set up a refinery in ratnagiri maharashtra saudi aramco and abu dhabi national oil co together were supposed to have 50 stake in the 44 billion project however it has been hit by farmer and political protests forcing the maharashtra government to announce a shift in its location in fact land acquisition issues continue to stymie several foreign investments easing land acquisition and managing it better must be part of india’s economic strategy the stronger india’s economy is and the greater the stake other countries have in it the more will foreign leaders heed india’s concerns

go home  they werent always alone  some had young children and others had pregnant wives and the life they had built for themselves packed into their ragtag bags  many never made it here the bbc tells

all of us  indeed it was sanju that encouraged rajan to push himself  i used to do an eighthour shift in a factory sanju motivated me do something more so we bought a food cart and started selling snacks from 1600 to 2200  she pushed me to think big she used to say that having our business was way better than a job job had a fixed salary but business allowed us to grow  two years ago all the hard work seemed to be paying off rajan used his savings and a bank loan to buy a tuktuk the vehicleforhire brought more money for sanju and her family  but then came coronavirus  image caption

died on the spot rajan and nitin escaped with minor injuries  it all ended so quickly rajan says we were so close to our village we were so excited but i have nothing left now  just a big void  he says he cant help but keep thinking about the train tickets that never came i wish i had gotten the tickets i wish i had never started the journey… i wish i was not poor  lallu ram yadav  image

the lockdown began and the cousins both found their savings quickly ran out  lallu ram called his family to say they were coming home  at least he would now get to spend time with his children he said  and so lallu ram and ajay kumar joined the desperate scramble to find a way home to the village in uttar pradeshs allahabad district some 1400km away  but the price demanded by lorry drivers proved too much instead inspired by the migrants walking home they saw on the television they packed small bags and began the journey on foot with four friends  image caption many migrants say they dont want to come back to cities  the covered around 400km in the first 48 hours  hitchhiking in lorries along the way but the journey was more difficult than they had imagined  it was really hot and we would

his children  the familys only breadwinner is gone says ajay kumar nobody helped us my cousin didnt have to die  but it was a choice between hunger and the long journey  we poor people often have to

was further extended in may their patience ran out  we couldnt have asked the family for more money we were supposed to help them not take money from them sahib says  they would wait in queues for

president trumps focus on these drugs has been extremely distracting to dozens of federal scientists  and the us food and drugs administration which granted emergency approval for using them in certain settings only has also warned about possible side effects  is there evidence they might treat covid19  president trump has previously referred to the potential of hydroxychloroquine in white house briefings at a press conference in april he said what do you have to lose take it  and brazilian president jair bolsonaro claimed in a video that hydroxychloroquine is working in all places although that was subsequently removed by facebook for breaching its misinformation guidelines  the publicity given to these drugs led to a global surge in demand for them  following mr trumps comments in late march there was a sharp increase reported in prescriptions in the us for both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine  tablets containing chloroquine have long been used in the treatment of malaria to reduce fever and inflammation and the hope is that they can also work against the virus that causes covid19  there are ongoing trials in various countries on using the drugs to prevent the illness as part of these studies frontline workers who are highly exposed to the virus are taking it as a prophylactic  other studies are looking into whether it can help patients who already have covid19  in the us various trials are under way for a combination of drugs including chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic called azithromycin for treating covid19 patients  but so far there is insufficient evidence from these trials as to their effective use in either prevention or in treatment  we need larger highquality randomised clinical trials in order to better evaluate their effectiveness says university of oxfords kome gbinigie author of a report on antimalarial testing for covid19  there are also risks of serious side effects including renal and liver damage  which countries authorised their use  in late march the us food and drugs administration fda has granted emergency use authorisation for these drugs in the treatment of covid19 for a limited number of hospitalised cases  the fda is not saying they definitely work but it does mean that in specific circumstances hospitals can request and use the medicines from government stockpiles for use in covid19 treatment  but on 24 april the fda also issued a warning about the dangers of using the substances because of reports of heart rhythm problems in patients  image copyright reuters image caption american scientists have begun a trial to see if chloroquine will help treat coronavirus  other countries are also deploying these antimalarial drugs to varying degrees  france has authorised doctors to prescribe them for patients with covid19 but the countrys medical watchdog has also warned of side effects  indias health ministry recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment for healthcare workers as well as households in contact with confirmed cases if they have a prescription from a doctor  however indias government research body has warned against the unrestricted usage of the antimalarial drug and said it was experimental and only for emergency situations  several middle eastern countries have authorised its use or are conducting trials  is there enough chloroquine available  as interest in these drugs has grown as a potential treatment for covid19 many countries have seen high demand and shortages  chloroquine and its derivatives have long been widely available in pharmacies particularly in developing countries for the treatment of malaria  this is despite their declining efficacy against malaria as the disease has become increasingly resistant  image copyright getty images  a number of countries restricted sales so that chloroquine was only available on prescription or in hospitals  india  a major producer of these antimalarial drugs  at one point stopped exports but it lifted the ban after president trump made a personal plea to indias prime minister narendra modi  in nigeria households still regularly use tablets containing chloroquine for treating malaria even though it was banned in 2005 for firstline use because of its declining effectiveness  but news of its possible use against covid19 led to growing demand and the nigerian centres for disease control told people to stop taking it  read more from reality check  send us your questions  follow us on twitter

threatened to withdraw funding from the world health organization accusing it of mismanaging the coronavirus pandemic particularly in its early stages as it emerged in china  weve been looking at some of the charges president trump has levelled against the who and the health bodys responses  claim 1  the who failed to adequately obtain vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion  this has become a regular theme of mr trumps criticism of the who and in his letter to its head dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus on 18 may he renewed this attack saying the who consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in wuhan in early december 2019 or even earlier  mr trump specifically highlighted reporting by the lancet medical journal  the editor of the lancet richard horton has written a letter in response saying the lancet did not publish any report in early december 2019 about a virus spreading in wuhan the first reports we published were from chinese scientists on jan 24 2020  in response to the criticisms levelled at it the who says it acted properly in accordance with the information it was given by china sharing it with medical and scientific experts around the world including from the us  the who says it was told by china of a pneumonia of an unknown cause on 31 december 2019  and this was flagged on who socialmedia accounts on 4 january  then on 5 january the who put out an official statement saying it had asked for more information about the illness from the chinese authorities  on 12 january china publicly shared the genetic sequence for the new coronavirus  on 20 and 21 january a regional who team visited wuhan  a public statement was issued by the who on 22 january setting out what they had discovered  on 28 january dr tedros went to beijing to discuss the outbreak with chinas leaders  by the end of january the who had declared the outbreak a publichealth emergency of global concern  it has also been reported that who experts drawn from 15 countries including china met a week earlier to discuss whether to issue a global alert but could not agree among themselves  claim 2  through the middle of january it parroted the idea that there was no humantohuman transmission happening despite clear evidence to the contrary  president trump identifies a critical few days here when the messaging from the who was evolving rapidly  on 14 january the who tweeted preliminary investigations conducted by the chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of humantohuman transmission  but the same day the head of the whos emerging diseases unit maria van kerkhove appeared to contradict this suggesting to journalists that limited humantohuman transmission had been observed in wuhan she did however stress that there was no clear evidence of sustained transmission between people  it wasnt until 22 january that the who confirmed there was clear evidence of humantohuman transmission in wuhan  the who has denied media reports that it delayed making this evidence public at chinas request  claim 3  the who has an alarming lack of independence from china  in his recent letter to the head of the who mr trump accuses the organisation of being too close to china failing to remain objective in its handling of the outbreak  its certainly the case that the who has publicly praised chinas response to the coronavirus outbreak and its commitment to transparency something that has clearly angered the us president in recent weeks  image copyright reuters  however many other experts and political leaders including mr trump have also praised chinas initial response to the outbreak  on 24 january mr trump was effusive in his support for chinas efforts  skip twitter post by realdonaldtrump china has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus the united states greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency it will all work out well in particular on behalf of the american people i want to thank president xi — donald j trump realdonaldtrump january 24 2020 report  dr michael ryan of the who says the organisation wanted to keep the lines of communication open with china as it battled to contain the virus  the who has also been accused of being unduly influenced by beijing over the status of taiwan  the issue here is that taiwan is not a member of the who as the island is not recognised by the un  the who however says it does engage with taiwan and share information with it  taiwan says it raised the alarm about the possible humantohuman spread of the virus at the end of december after some of its scientists had visited wuhan  taiwan says its warnings were ignored or not taken seriously  but the evidence published so far shows taiwans exchanges with the who did not specifically mention humantohuman transmission  claim 4  one of the most dangerous decisions from the who was to oppose travel restrictions they actually fought us  the us restricted travel from china and other countries from 2 february  but there is no record of the who publicly criticising this move  and it would have been highly unusual for it to do so  image copyright getty images image caption the us introduced restrictions on flights from china in early february  but it had on 10 january put out advice recommending no international travel restrictions in response to the virus  and this was reconfirmed in a statement at the end of february saying travel bans were not usually that effective and could have an adverse social and economic impact although they might be justified for a short period of time at

229,coronavirus whats the risk on public transport,image copyright kirsty oconnor  pa media image caption at clapham junction station some seats are taped off to keep people apart  since the uk went into lockdown there have been reduced services on trains buses and planes and the government has advised against all but essential travel  now with restrictions being eased in england more people are being encouraged back to work  the government says they should avoid public transport and walk cycle or drive instead  but if they cant what are the risks of taking the bus or train  how safe are train and bus travel  a lot of the potential risk of infection on trains and buses depends on how crowded they are and so how far away you can keep from other people this applies both on the vehicles and at stops and stations and will vary in different parts of the country and on different routes  ventilation also plays an important role as fresh air can help droplets containing the virus dissipate faster so being able to open a window can be an advantage  coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs sneezes or exhales small droplets packed with the virus into the air  these droplets can enter the body through the eyes nose and mouth either directly or after touching a contaminated object  the governments consistent message has been to stay 2m more than 6ft apart from people outside your household  image copyright henry nicholls  reuters image caption people sit apart on the tube as they try to keep their distance  previous research has suggested a link between commuting on the london underground and the likelihood of catching respiratory illnesses  dr lara gosce at the institute of global health says her research published in 2018 showed people who used the underground regularly were more likely to suffer flulike symptoms  particularly it shows that boroughs served by fewer lines  where inhabitants are forced to change line one or more times when travelling on the underground  have higher rates of influenzalike diseases compared to wellserved boroughs where passengers reach their destination by one direct trip she said  if youre travelling on a relatively empty train or bus though your risks would be different how long you spend on transport will also play a role  spending more time in contact and coming into contact with more people will increase your risk  so limiting the number of close contacts with potentially infected individuals and objects is important according to dr gosce  in terms of travel avoid peak hours if possible she says suggesting where viable passengers should choose routes involving only one means of transport  what is the advice for passengers  the government says people should consider all other forms of transport before using public transport if they cant walk cycle or drive to their destination they are advised to  travel at offpeak times  take a less busy route and reduce the number of changes  wait for other passengers to get off before boarding  keep 2m away from people where possible  wash their hands for at least 20 seconds after completing their journey  the government acknowledges that there may be situations where people cant keep 2m away from each other such as at busy times or getting on or off public transport in these cases the advice is to avoid physical contact and face away from others  governments in england scotland and northern ireland have also recommended people wear face coverings on public transport  the welsh government has said people can choose to wear them but adds the evidence is not strong enough to make them mandatory  face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission in some circumstances in particular they are to stop the wearer passing on coronavirus rather than protecting them from others  what safety measures are travel operators taking  transport networks around the country are enhancing their safety measures to protect staff and passengers  arriva buses is only accepting contactless payment and will no longer give change for cash payments  transport for london is installing hand sanitisers at all tube rail and bus stations and has introduced a rigorous cleaning schedule  it says it will only be able to carry 1315 of its normal number of passengers on the underground and buses  on wednesday morning national rail reported a 10 rise in passengers compared with the same time last week  londons tube saw a 73 rise with 83293 journeys by 10am but this was a fraction of normal passenger volume which saw 12m journeys by 10am on the same day last year  network rail which owns britains rail infrastructure introduced a new timetable on monday 18 may which added about 3000 trains per day but the company said passenger capacity was still only between 10 and 13 of normal levels  security guards trained in crowd control have been put on duty at some major railway stations while some intercity services are only allowing passengers with reservations onto trains  what is the situation around the uk  people in england who are allowed to return to work have been asked not to use public transport if possible  people in wales have been told to avoid it where possible  limited public transport services are running in scotland for people who absolutely need to get to work and the situation is similar in northern ireland

global pandemic by the world health organization who on 11 march this is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time  the true number of cases is thought to be much higher than the reported figures as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted  globally more than 45 billion people  half the worlds population  have been living under social distancing measures according to the afp news agencys estimates  those restrictions have had a big impact on the global economy with the international monetary fund warning the world faces the worst recession since the great depression of the 1930s  the united nations world food programme has also warned that the pandemic could almost double the number of people suffering acute hunger  where are coronavirus cases still rising  while some countries are starting to see confirmed cases and deaths fall following the introduction of strict lockdown restrictions others are only now seeing them rise  a sharp increase in cases in latin america has led the who to say the americas are currently at the centre of the pandemic  these charts show four countries where deaths are on an upward trajectory  as shown by the red lines  brazil now has the third highest number of infections in the world  overtaking the uk spain and italy however the countrys health experts have warned that the real number of confirmed infections could be far higher due to a lack of testing  bruno covas mayor of brazils largest city são paulo which is home to 12 million people has warned its health system could collapse because of the growing demand for emergency beds  mexico has also seen a spike in new infections while ecuador saw its health system collapse in april  outside south america russia has seen infections rise rapidly and now has the second highest number worldwide according to official data it has been reporting around 10000 new cases a day for over a week  in africa lesotho confirmed its first cases on 13 may which means coronavirus is now present in all countries on the continent mainly in urban populations worsthit are south africa egypt and algeria  europe continues to see cases and deaths fall  after being labelled the epicentre of the pandemic  by the who in march europe is now slowly beginning to ease restrictions brought in to slow the spread of the virus  the uk italy spain and france along with others now appear to have passed the peak with the number of new confirmed cases and deaths falling  the uk and italy have seen more than 30000 deaths while france and spain have recorded 28000 and 27000 respectively  however differences in population size and how countries report their figures with some including deaths in care homes or deaths of those suspected but not confirmed of having the virus means international comparisons are complicated  european countries have varied in their plans to ease lockdowns but the who has urged all nations to adopt a slow steady approach  new york the worsthit in us outbreak  with more than 15 million cases the us has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world it has also recorded more than 90000 deaths  the state of new york has been particularly badly affected with more than 28000 deaths but the number of new cases there has been on a downward trend in recent weeks  at one point more than 90 of the us population was under mandatory lockdown orders but many states have now begun to loosen their stayathome restrictions and allowed some businesses to reopen  a move health officials fear could further spread the virus  only 14 us states have met the federal recommended guidelines for reopening  which suggest a decline in new cases daily for two weeks  according to a study by reuters  the top us infectious diseases doctor anthony fauci has cautioned against opening up public life too soon warning of further little spikes which would become outbreaks  president trump who disagrees with dr faucis advice has made it clear he is keen to reopen the us economy vaccine or no vaccine  the latest figures show more than 36 million people have lost their jobs since the outbreak hit the us thats nearly a quarter of the american workforce  the rise means the jobless rate is now worse than at any time since the great depression of the 1930s  the chairman of the federal reserve jerome powel has warned the us economy could easily contract by 2030 amid the pandemic and the downturn might last until late 2021  about this data  the data used on this page comes from a variety of sources it includes figures collated by johns hopkins university data from the european centre for disease prevention and control national governments and health agencies as well as un data on populations  when comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way this makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult  other factors to consider include different population sizes the size of the a countrys elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely populated areas in addition countries may be in different stages of the pandemic
231,coronavirus how long does it take to recover,image copyright getty images  more than one million people around the world are known to have recovered from coronavirus according to johns hopkins university but the road back to full health is not the same for everyone  recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place some people will shrug off the illness quickly but for others it could leave lasting problems  age gender and other health issues all increase the risk of becoming more seriously ill from covid19  the more invasive the treatment you receive and the longer it is performed the longer recovery is likely to take  what if i have only mild symptoms  most people who get covid19 will develop only the main symptoms  a cough or fever but they could experience body aches fatigue sore throat and headache  the cough is initially dry but some people will eventually start coughing up mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus  these symptoms are treated with bed rest plenty of fluids and pain relief such as paracetamol  image copyright getty images  people with mild symptoms should make a good and speedy recovery  the fever should settle in less than a week although the cough may linger a world health organization who analysis of chinese data says it takes two weeks on average to recover  what if i have more serious symptoms  the disease can become much more serious for some this tends to happen about seven to 10 days into the infection  the transformation can be sudden breathing becomes difficult and the lungs get inflamed this is because although the bodys immune system is trying to fight back  its actually overreacting and the body experiences collateral damage  some people will need to be in hospital for oxygen therapy  gp sarah jarvis says the shortness of breath may take some considerable time to improve the body is getting over scarring and inflammation  she says it could take two to eight weeks to recover with tiredness lingering  what if i need intensive care  the who estimates one person in 20 will need intensive care treatment which can include being sedated and put on a ventilator  it will take time to recover from any spell in an intensive or critical care unit icu no matter what the illness patients are moved to a regular ward before going home  dr alison pittard dean of the faculty of intensive care medicine says it can take 12 to 18 months to get back to normal after any spell in critical care  spending a long time in a hospital bed leads to muscle mass loss patients will be weak and muscle will take time to build up again some people will need physiotherapy to walk again  image copyright getty images image caption coronavirus rehabilitation in france  because of what the body goes through in icu theres also the possibility of delirium and psychological disorders  there does seem to be an added element with this disease  viral fatigue is definitely a huge factor says paul twose critical care physiotherapist at cardiff and vale university health board  there have been reports from china and italy of wholebody weakness shortness of breath after any level of exertion persistent coughing and irregular breathing plus needing a lot of sleep  we do know patients take a considerable period potentially months to recover  but it is hard to generalise some people spend relatively short periods in critical care while others are ventilated for weeks  will coronavirus affect my health longterm  we dont know for sure as there is no longterm data but we can look at other conditions  acute respiratory distress syndrome called ards develops in patients whose immune systems go into overdrive causing damage to the lungs  there is really good data that even five years down the line people can have ongoing physical and psychological difficulties says mr twose  dr james gill a gp and lecturer at warwick medical school says people also need mental health support to improve recovery  youre finding breathing difficult then the doctor says we need to put you on a ventilator we need to put you to sleep do you want to say goodbye to your family  ptsd posttraumatic stress disorder in these most severe patients is not unsurprising there will be significant psychological scars for many  there remains the possibility that even some mild cases may leave patients with longterm health problems  such as fatigue  how many people have recovered  getting an accurate figure is difficult  as of 1 may johns hopkins university reported more than 1021000 people had recovered out of 32 million people known to have been infected around the world  image copyright getty images image caption a covid19 gives prostration of thanks on leaving hospital in morocco  but countries use different recording methods some are not publishing recovery figures and many mild infections will be missed  mathematical models have estimated between 99995 of people recover  can i catch covid19 again  there has been much speculation but little evidence on how durable any immunity is if patients have successfully fought off the virus they must have built up an immune response  reports of patients being infected twice may just be down to tests incorrectly recording they were free of the virus  the immunity question is vital for understanding whether people can be reinfected and how effective any vaccine may be  follow james on twitter

writer lionel shriver described communicating with friends and family during lockdown summarising many of our frustrations  while the coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges in all areas of our lives the lack of human contact is one of the hardest but for some it has been a time to get creative about how we keep in touch and has prompted a return to a more traditional medium letters  as the lockdown was introduced in the republic of ireland in late march the countrys postal service an post sent each household two free stamps and postcards to encourage people to write to each other it has since reported an increase in nonbusiness persontoperson mail  riona nolan a 17yearold student from county carlow used the opportunity to cut back on social media and instead put pen to paper  you

and also writes to her grandmother  image copyright riona nolan image caption riona nolan took advantage of an posts free postcards  riona says it is a far more personal authentic form of communication its also a welcome change from the bills and taxes that people usually receive through the letterbox  but what does she write about when we are all stuck inside  i told her about how i was baking  i asked for any recipes she might have says riona i was talking about how much the weather has improved since lockdown  i said how much i miss her and i was telling her about all the things i cant wait to do when i see her again  dear future self…  letters are not only a form of communication they can act as a museum piece for the future as i discovered while seeing out lockdown at my parents house on one rainy day i dug up a case of letters belonging to my grandmother who died six years ago the scrawled handwriting described historical events such as ve day and the queens coronation but most importantly captured my granny at her most alive  reading these letters encouraged me to write my own letters to friends i wrote to a friend from school who said she recognised my handwriting as soon as the envelope landed on the doormat despite not having seen it in more than 15 years  alison lagarry and lucia mock lecturers in education at the university of north carolina at chapel hill asked their students to write letters to their future selves as a way of documenting these strange times the letters are then posted online so fellow students can read them and reply  in one short swoop jampacked streets transformed into ghost towns writes one student in their letter the world began to mirror much of your life directionless  the letters expose these students innermost fears and anxieties in a way social media might not lucia says this is because there is always an element of performance in our onscreen lives  letters encourage us to be vulnerable alison says but its also a format in which we feel comfortable saying more personal things  the letters also show what the students have learned from the crisis in order to build a more positive and grateful future  from a person who is living in limbo learn to not wait for moments to come to you says another letter dont wait for your graduation or prom to make memories with your best friends  dance in the rain and hug your friends every chance you get  i wanted to say thank you  before the lockdown kicked in in south dakota 11yearold emerson weber already had what her dad hugh called a serious letter writing habit she exchanges letters regularly with about a dozen of her friends decorating the envelopes as if they are a piece of art  i write about my brother finn and i share a joke at the end she says i always include something ive been doing or a piece of art and a bit of personal stuff something i saw that i liked a little bit about my love for taylor swift  during the pandemic emerson decided to use letters as a way to thank key workers  including the postman doug the united states postal service usps has come under fire during the pandemic after us president donald trump called it a joke insisting he would not help to bail out the struggling organisation unless it dramatically increased the price of sending packages  but emersons story shows that the service is still highly valued by the people who use it  you may know me as the person that lives here that writes a lot of letters  decorated the envelopes she said in her letter to doug well i wanted to thank you for taking my letters and delivering them you are very important to me i make people happy with my letters but you do too  image copyright hugh weber image caption postman doug has had his work cut out delivering to the webers home in recent weeks  she was sure it would end there but doug showed the letter to his supervisor who wrote to emerson thanking her she also shared the story in a regional newsletter for the usps  just days later doug arrived on emersons doorstep with two boxes of letters addressed to her from mail workers all around the country  they were very personal says emerson they included a joke or two like i do they told me about their families and where they work and what their job was in the postal service  one maintenance manager from minnesota even sent rare vintage stamps to encourage emerson to start a collection  hugh says this was more than people just wanting to write to emerson writing letters made them feel seen allowing them to share snapshots of their lives  i work alone in a small rural post office  my kids all live far away  not a lot of people think about how hard we work…  emerson is half way through responding to the hundreds of letters she received and since hugh posted about her story on twitter shes been receiving even more  last week she got an extra special one when she opened the packaging a tag read to em from tay  image copyright hugh weber image caption love your pen pal taylor  inside there was a carefully decorated envelope and a letter from none other than her favourite singer taylor swift who said she had seen in emersons story an innate sense of empathy a curiosity about the feelings of strangers and the drive to try to brighten someones day swift also sent emerson some special wax seals to help her secure her envelopes  emerson encourages everyone to write a letter to someone they care about or someone theyre thankful for  its the simple things agrees hugh the basics the humanity connection

recent video shared on sunday rami makhlouf stares at the lens speaking quietly almost whispering some sentences  his beard is whiter than in the photographs of his pomp when he radiated wealth and power counting his billions as the money man not just of the regime but of his family which is about the same thing  makhlouf has not lost the sheen of wealth he is a man who will never be poor rare in syria where the un says 80 of the population live in poverty almost 10 million do not have enough to eat and half have lost their homes because of the war  he lives in a valley beloved of syrias superrich on the road out of damascus heading towards beirut  in the videos makhloufs jacket looks expensive and italian as he sits in a corner of his home in front of an artfully stacked pile of

business deal in syria the reason why some called him mr five percent  rare rebuke  rami makhlouf is a first cousin on the maternal side of president bashar alassad theyre about the same age in their

eu imposed sanctions on rami makhlouf in 2011 saying he bankrolled the assad regime  in an interview with the new york times in 2011 when the war was gathering pace he said that syrias ruling elite  the assads the makhloufs and a few close associates  would fight until the end they should know when we suffer we will not suffer alone  all that turned out to be true but his other promise was that they would stay united his videos show that has not happened  on social media he has posted a prayer asking god to end the injustice he is suffering as well as the three videos which contain criticisms of the regime such posts would land most syrians in jail  on 3 may he said mr president security apparatuses have started to infringe on peoples freedom those are your people your

165m euros in back taxes for a man of his means that is not a lot of money even his son mohammad who is based in dubai is described as a billionaire in gushing online profiles  as his sons took down photos from instagram that celebrated their lavish lifestyles makhlouf shared on facebook a correspondence that claimed to be an offer to pay what was owed  but it is increasingly clear that his estranged cousin bashar is after much more of the multibillion dollar makhlouf business empire than a relatively trifling sum in back taxes  syrias coffers are bare after almost a decade of war that has destroyed much of the country  hand of russia  in his most recent video posted on sunday makhlouf apologised to his staff at least 28 of his employees were arrested by syrias security agencies in

security men can do  image copyright afp image caption syriatel is syrias biggest telecommunication company with 11m subscribers  a number of theories are circulating about makhloufs fall some say he had become too big and too rich for his boots  the first signs of pressure emerged last summer when he was forced to shut down his charitable network bustan which had spawned a militia of about 20000 men  the theory focuses on the presidents wife asma al assad who grew up in london and is seen by syrians as a force in the regime running her own large charitable organisation  another theory centres on relations with the kremlin  corruption in syria has been criticised in russian media outlets associated with president vladimir putin who is assads most important ally and protector  his decision to intervene in syria in 2015 has all but won the war for the assad regime  the theory goes that assad does not want to lose putins protection and rami makhlouf is an obvious sacrifice because for many syrians he is a symbol of the corruption that runs root and branch through the country  russian businessmen close to putin must also have their eyes on contracts that makhlouf might have regarded as his own  history of rifts  the fact is noone outside the ruling family really knows exactly what has happened behind the regimes closed doors  bashars father hafez the first president assad made

hafez was ill with heart problems rifaat sent tanks from his paramilitary force onto the streets of damascus in a bid to grab power the attempt failed  rifaats fate was not jail or death but exile

cutbacks  the international energy agency expects global oil supply to fall to a nineyear low this month as producers around the world reduce output in response to prices that dropped by more than twothirds in april before starting to stabilise  but even before the coronavirus pandemic hit the industry was experiencing a supply glut  driven by the us boom  that had depressed prices and prompted strains in oilproducing texas and elsewhere the wall street money that helped power the fracking growth had grown harder to come by while big firms were promoting investments in renewable energy  forecasters at ihs markit say supply is unlikely to return to 2019 levels until at least 2023 there is a chance that 2019 will have been the high point for global output should the pandemic permanently reduce energy demand  for example by increasing telework and reducing business travel  this is a transformational crisis for the world and what happens to oil will be shaped by the broader forces of change that are coming out of covid19 says jim burkhard the firms head of oil market research  theres enough of these variables in play where you dont have to have a doomsday view of the world to consider that oil demand could have peaked in 2019 thats not our base case but it is our alternative scenario  i see it going away completely  in the us several large us companies have

and economic development in poor countries will drive continuing demand for oil  some people who dont understand the way the industry works  think now is the time to transition entirely to renewables there is definitely room for renewables and we need to increase those but we dont go zero to 60 she says  its important that we dont give up on the ingenuity that created the shale boom thats what put us in the great position that were in as the worlds largest producer  we need to maintain that  but the best days of the industry may be over mr bloxsom says pointing to the scarcity of young people

 its a year since ukraines best known comedian was sworn in as president  volodymyr zelensky won by a landslide on the back of bold promises to reform the country and end the war of attrition in

others who did  on the far left of the picture is alex danylyuk a former finance minister hes credited with helping clean up ukraines banking sector  mr danylyuk was at mr zelenskys side throughout the later stages of the election campaign and after the vote given a powerful job in charge of national security  the next man across  the man with the stubble  is rouslan riaboshapka his background is in law and fighting corruption he was handed the job of prosecutor general perhaps the most important of all the roles beneath the president  ukrainian presidents have consistently used the prosecutor general and his office as a tool to pursue their enemies and to reward their friends cutting corrupt deals with oligarchs in return for favourable tv coverage or a share of illgotten gains it was the rotten heart of a rotten political system  mr riaboshapka promised to be independent and different he immediately embarked on an ambitious attempt to clean up the prosecutors office  the appointment of mr riaboshapka mr danylyuk and several other wellrespected reformers was seen by ukraine observers both at home and abroad as a clear sign that president zelensky intended to try to deliver of his ambitious promises  youve probably guessed it by now but the dreamteam didnt last long alex danylyuk stayed four months rouslan riaboshapka seven  i met up with alex danylyuk in kyiv this week he resigned from mr zelenskys team in september last year after falling out with the presidents chief of staff also now departed  mr danylyuk told me he had no regrets about backing the former comedian and doesnt doubt his good intentions or desire to change things  so what went wrong  he zelensky surrounded himself with very weak opportunistic people mr danylyuk says the comedian brought with him incompetent people who now run major government institutions  a reshuffle at the start of march saw almost all recognised reformers purged from office among them mr danylyuks fellow dreamteamer rouslan riaboshapka  hes now in france so i caught up with him via skype and his assessment of whats taken place is bleak  mr riaboshapka tells me he had big fish in his prosecutorial sight meaning ukraines rich oligarchs but that after initially backing far reaching reforms and deoligarchisation president zelensky dramatically lost his nerve  instead of choosing to fight the oligarchs mr riaboshapka tells me with a sigh he chose peace and consensus with them  image copyright getty images image caption ivan bakanov was given the task of running ukraines sbu state security

250,after the wall fell,“by any standard this is a profoundly shocking case  noone should go to work and die in 21st century britain”  daniel lemberger cooper the families’ lawyer works for imran khan  partners the firm that represented the family of the murdered black teenager stephen lawrence  he maintains the tragedy at shredmet is only a small part of a wider problem the men’s deaths he warns have implications for anyone employed in similar jobs  the industry the men were employed in  waste and recycling  is the second most dangerous in the uk between 2014 and 2018 almost eight in every 100000 workers died this rate is 17 times the national average according to a 2019 hse report  it is among the uk’s most lucrative industries worth an estimated £7bn a year to the economy in recent years it has enjoyed a boom demand has been driven by rising metal prices a shortage of landfill sites and laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in them  mr cooper says the recycling industry “exploits migrant labour for enormous profits”  daniel lemberger cooper said the mens deaths raised issues for every worker in britain daniel lemberger cooper said the mens deaths raised issues for every worker in britain  “there is a now huge demand for recycling and the industry is getting bigger and bigger and these workers will be needed more and more” he says  “the five men were honest hardworking and decent human beings  “the conditions in which these workers were employed of precarious employment zerohours contracts temporary and agency work the socalled gig economy and exploitation and issues of low pay and long hours are spreading throughout the economy” he adds  “this is an issue for every worker in britain”  leading safety experts say the standard of the uk’s health and safety enforcement has declined over the past decade  after years of cuts there are fewer inspectors carrying out fewer inspections leaving many workplaces unsafe they say  shredmet had not been inspected by the hse since the 2010 accident in which an employee injured their arm  lawrence waterman chairman of the british safety council says the hse has been underresourced since the days of the coalition government  in 2010 the government imposed 33 cuts on the hse then in 2012 the prime minister david cameron stated the uks excessive health and safety culture was costing businesses billions and he intended to kill it off for good  after the conservatives won the general election in 2015 further cuts followed in the spending review later that year  lawrence waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe lawrence waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe  “it’s not just resources that have had an impact” says mr waterman  it’s the political hangover of now two prime ministers ago who wanted to kill health and safety with a feeling that red tape ruled and we were being told how to live our lives  “well the other side of that is that five guys never came home to their families  “hanging over businesses and the government is the need to be honest and place more value on looking after people at work”  hilda palmer from the hazards campaign which promotes workplace safety says a disproportionately large number of those killed or injured at work are immigrants  “unfortunately if you look at the names of the people that are killed they are mostly foreignsounding names  eastern europeans and now west african” she says  “i also know of a case involving some peruvians it seems it’s the new wave of migrants that get drawn in  the most vulnerable”  flowers left at the site of the accident in 2016 flowers left at the site of the accident in 2016  she says legislation enforcement and trade unions have all been “attacked through the cuts”  “that creates an environment for cowboys to flourish” she added “if employers see checks being done prosecutions fines and notices being issued that reminds them to act”  the conservatives declined to comment but vince cable the former liberal democrat leader who was a member of the coalition cabinet says the global financial crisis was to blame  “austerity was going to happen whatever government came in” he says  “the cuts labour chancellor alistair darling had were the same as what the coalition did and this was as a result of the huge financial crisis and reduced revenue that the country found itself in”  laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling  the dead mens families remain bewildered that three years after the accident the hse has still not decided whether or not to charge shredmet  mr waterman says the slowness of the hse investigation is due to its underfunding the hse aims to complete 80 of fatal investigations within one year but in 201819 just 65 were  “when you look at that it’s not unreasonable for the families to feel that justice is being denied” mr waterman says  “if the families of the five guys were pluggedin middleclass agitators there may have been more pressure being felt to keep the hse focused on finding out what happened”  “if immediate legislative change is not enacted there are going to be more injuries and further deaths”  the hse says the families’ demand for a speedy conclusion is “understandable” but it needs to ensure its investigation is “thorough”  “as with many complex challenging criminal investigations relating to multiple fatalities following new lines of inquiry and forensically examining evidence can mean investigations take longer than families would understandably hope” a spokesman says  “since the inquests concluded our time and energy has been fully focused on reviewing the case bringing together evidence heard by the coroner and concluding the criminal investigation  “we are working hard to resolve any delays and have endeavoured to give regular updates to the families where possible”  the families lawyer believes they are the victims of a legal system that does not treat deaths at work with the same seriousness as other fatalities  “the criminal justice system fails to treat deaths and injuries at work – unlike deaths in almost any other setting – as the possible outcome of serious crimes and this must urgently change” mr cooper says  he wants the government to legislate to prevent the exploitation of workers  “a fitting tribute and legacy to those that died would be that immediate steps are taken by government to ensure that we learn the lessons of why these men died so that noone else suffers like they have” he says  “if immediate legislative change is not enacted there are going to be more injuries and further deaths the government and employers will have blood on their hands”
251,the uber driver evicted from home and left to die of coronavirus,image copyright mary jayaseelan  the last time mary jayaseelan spoke to her husband rajesh he was about to be hooked up to a ventilator in a covid ward  rajesh was being treated in northwick park hospital in london the city where he worked as an uber driver for most of the year mary was 5000 miles away in their family home in bangalore india with their two young sons until that point he had repeatedly told her he would be fine that he was feeling ill but she was not to worry hed get better  at 44 years old he was young and otherwise healthy  but on that call he broke down and admitted mary im feeling a bit scared  rajesh jayaseelan died the following day  rajesh and mary got married on 24 february 2014 and rented a home in hulimavu south bangalore that they shared with his 66yearold mum for most of the year rajesh rented a room in harrow north london and drove an uber vehicle in the city hed work from late in the evening to the early hours of the morning  the busy hours  so he could save enough money to spend a few months with his family in india  he enjoyed working as a driver although he didnt realise that his precarious gig economy job would leave him vulnerable in the global health crisis that would later emerge  hed been living in london onandoff for 22 years and would come back to india for a few months at a time mary says he loved london he always used to talk to me about how beautiful london was and so clean ive never been to london so he would describe it to me  they were very happy rajesh loved his wife and playing with their two sons aged six and four when he wasnt in india he would videocall them every day  he was also a really good singer mary says full of pride he sang a lot of hindi songs  he was also a humble gentle person his close friend sunil kumar adds sunil and rajesh first met in 2011  they were both from bangalore so mutual friends there put them in touch when sunil moved to the uk they would help each other navigate the uks various bureaucratic systems loaned each other small amounts of money when needed and sunil and his wife would have rajesh over for meals at their home in hertfordshire  sending him back with several days worth of leftovers of delicious south indian food  although rajesh loved london he didnt plan to stay forever  he wanted to be reunited with his family in india renting their home in hulimavu was relatively expensive so during his last stay in bangalore at the end of 2019 he and his wife took out a loan and bought land to build their own home the loan was no problem they thought  rajesh would go back to london and put enough money aside to pay it off the next time he travelled to bangalore he told his wife it would be for good  he came back to london on 15 january less than two weeks later the first cases of coronavirus were reported in the uk  image copyright mary jayaseelan image caption rajesh and mary on their wedding day in february 2014  although the virus had reached britain at this point rajesh wasnt too worried shops and restaurants were still open people were still going into work and then going out for everyone including uber drivers it was business as usual and not much changed for another month  then march came around and the virus was passing from person to person within the uk the number of cases  and by now deaths  was increasing every day people were told to selfisolate for seven days if they had any symptoms  even mild ones such as a fever or a persistent cough  on 23 march prime minister boris johnson announced a nationwide lockdown lasting an initial three weeks meaning that most businesses would close and people would only be allowed outside for one form of exercise a day and for essential trips to the shops unless they were considered essential workers  like many uber drivers rajesh continued to work at first but he quickly developed flulike symptoms and had to stop his last job was on 25 march  a dropoff at heathrow airport  his symptoms became much worse and he was admitted to the hospital with dehydration while there he was tested for the coronavirus  it came back positive  staff told rajesh to go home selfisolate and to come back if his symptoms got worse he did as he was told and went home to his room but things were about to get even worse  the landlord sent rajesh out of the house for something and when he came back the landlord had changed the locks so he couldnt get in mary says he tried knocking on the door and asking the landlord to speak to him but he wouldnt open the door  his landlord didnt know about his positive diagnosis  but he told him that as an uber driver he might bring the coronavirus back into the house and that it wasnt a risk he was willing to take  with nowhere else to turn rajesh was forced to sleep in his car for several nights  he had no food in there nothing to eat at all mary says  at this point he called his friend sunil for advice  image copyright mary jayaseelan  that was the last call he made to me sunil says he didnt go into details about what was happening to him but because i work in the nhs he was asking me questions like how safe are we is it better to go to india… things like that he was asking me if i knew any routes if there was any possible way he could go  he wanted to go to india and be with his family but by that time there was a complete lockdown in india too  sunil told him the best thing to do would be to stay at home not to work and to look into the financial support for selfemployed workers the government had just announced or the 14 days assistance offered by uber  rajesh agreed and explained he needed to find a new place to live because his landlord said he was high risk but sunil says he didnt say that hed already been kicked out he may have been embarrassed  rajesh then went back to trying to call his landlord to plead with him to let him stay there was no answer  after days of searching he eventually found another room in a shared house in harrow the new landlord made him pay £4000 upfront  money he didnt have and mary says he had to borrow  what if this happens to me  if your landlord kicks you out of your home without giving you notice or locks you out of your home it is likely to be an illegal eviction  a criminal offence in all uk nations  this is still the case during the coronavirus pandemic under the coronavirus act notice periods for evictions have been extended to three months  this means that for most private and social tenants even if they receive an eviction notice theyre likely to have the legal right to stay in their home andy parnell helpline adviser for housing charity shelter tells the bbc  but he says sadly there are some groups not protected by the recent changes to the evictions law including lodgers with livein landlords  lodgers have fewer rights than private renters with liveout landlords and landlords dont need to go to court to evict a lodger but they are required to provide reasonable notice before asking them to leave the property  people in rajeshs situation should call the local councils homelessness team as soon as possible and all councils have an emergency outofhours number if you dont have anywhere to sleep you should go to the councils office in person bringing id and any proof of immigration status with you  earlier this month shelter also told renters in this situation to stay put  once rajesh was back indoors he didnt want to risk being evicted again he hid himself away and avoided contact with his new landlord and all the other tenants not even daring to try and cook a meal for himself his health became worse with every passing day the only social interaction he had were daily phone calls with his wife where he would alternate between reassuring her that he would be fine and crying  it was during one of these calls that mary noticed he was struggling to breathe  he was wheezing a lot in that room and every day it was getting worse she says one night i told him to go to the hospital he didnt want to call an ambulance because he didnt want others there to know he was ill in case he was evicted again  rajesh drove himself to the hospital despite being severely out of breath when he got there he was diagnosed with pneumonia  the next morning he called me from the hospital for a video call  but when the children saw him they started crying because of how ill he was mary says he turned off his video and told me he didnt want them to remember him looking so unwell they would speak only a few more times  on 11 april the doctors caring for rajesh called mary and explained that he was in a critical state and they didnt think his condition would improve they arranged a video call for her and the children to see him one final time he was unconscious he died two hours later  while coronavirus doesnt discriminate has been repeated often during this pandemic it is evident that the virus is worse for some than others one group hit particularly hard are gig economy workers  the gig economy is where people take on shortterm or freelance work instead of permanent jobs these include privatehire cab drivers like rajesh as well as food delivery workers and couriers last year about 47 million people in the uk worked in gig economy jobs while according to a 2018 study 60 of the global population is in insecure work  research by the world economic forum and other bodies shows these workers are disproportionately affected by the pandemic  a combination of being classified as essential workers requiring them to continue interacting with strangers a lack of guaranteed paid sick leave that makes it harder to selfisolate low and insecure pay making it more likely for them to be living in dangerous and insecure housing situations and no entitlement to risk assessments or protective equipment  ayako ebata from the institute of development studies says because people in insecure work heavily rely on their daily wages they are under a lot of pressure not to lose their jobs or take time off even when there are significant health risks  its not because theyre ignorant or uninformed its because the whole system is forcing them to make decisions that eventually prove detrimental to their livelihoods and health she says  image copyright mary jayaseelan  dr alex wood a sociologist at oxford university focusing on the gig economy and insecure work agrees  and says a lack of workplace protection makes the problem much worse  people have been told by these platforms that they dont need to worry about rights and protections because when the economys fine there isnt really any risk he says in reality when you have these crises its the workers who pay  despite many of them now being classified as essential  now drivers in the uk are calling for greater protection from the government united private hire drivers uphd an independent trade body for privatehire drivers has this week called for an urgent judicial review on the matter  what the government is saying now is that its not safe for you to go to a barbershop but its somehow safe for you to ride around in an uber james farrar from the uphd says  race is a risk factor too according to multiple recent studies bame people in the uk like rajesh are disproportionately more likely to be in insecure work than their white counterparts  research from the trade union congress tuc last year found that ethnic minority workers are a third more likely to be in insecure work a report released last month by carnegie uk trust ucl and operation black vote also found that bame millennials in particular were 47 more likely to be on zerohours contracts  another notoriously unstable form of work  at the same time recent studies show that bame people in the uk are disproportionately more likely to become critically ill and to die from coronavirus ethnic minority patients make up 34 of those in intensive care despite making up only 13 of the population  early research suggests this is down to a combination of risk factors  an increased incidence of highrisk underlying health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension as well as social factors and systemic inequality  coronavirus is making a lot of the inequalities in our society that we had previously turned a blind eye to very clear dr wood says  after learning that her son had died rajeshs mother became ill she suffered hypertension and a spike in her blood sugar level and has been confined to her bed shes been inconsolable since mary says  faced with a loan for the house upcoming medical bills and childrens school fees mary is trying to find work as a cleaner in their area but the lockdown is making it much more difficult to get on top of their finances  sunil is helping them with money where he can and has set up an online fundraiser for them hes also looking into whether he can pursue legal action against rajeshs first landlord and marys relatives in bangalore have set up a fundraiser for her in india uber also contacted the bbc to offer their condolences  but more than anything mary is struggling to come to terms with how quickly everything has changed for her family  now that rajesh is gone our life has become very difficult she says i dont know what well do without him
252,dyatlov pass,on the snow mobiles we are now on the final leg of our journey going on a steep track uphill we pass pine trees and birch trees laden down with snow i also notice some animal footprints there are reindeer wolverines and lynx in these forests the sky is blue but our guide warns that the weather is unpredictable and can change at any minute  further on we rise above the forest where there are just a few dwarf pines and flinty rocks poking through the snow we are on the eastern slope of kholat syakhyl which i’m told means mountain of death the swirling winds sting our faces and clouds descend quickly limiting vision to only a few metres  yet on the night of 1 february for some inexplicable reason the students pitched their tent here our guide alexander agrees that it seems like a strangely exposed place to camp “maybe they had climbed up this far and didn’t want to lose any height” he says  he adds that their tent was erected in a shallow pit which had presumably been dug to shelter the group from the wind  when mikhail sharavin from the search party eventually stumbled on the tent nearly a month later it was 300 metres from the top of the mountain  today sharavin is an 83yearold widower living in an isolated ramshackle house an hour’s drive outside yekaterinburg he is skinny bald and hollow cheeked but his eyes light up with pride when he tells me how he found the tent  one tent pole was sticking up above the snow and there was a flashlight resting on top of the canvas which remarkably still worked when he switched it on  the following day on 27 february his worst fears were confirmed when he and some others in the rescue party found the first of the bodies  “we approached a cedar tree” says sharavin “and when we were 20 metres away we saw a brown spot – it was towards the right of the trunk and when we got closer we saw two corpses lying there the hands and the feet were reddishbrown”  one of the two bodies was yura doroshenko next to him was yuri krivonischenko who played the mandolin and loved telling jokes he had bitten off a piece of his own knuckle both men were stripped to their underwear  closer to the tree the search party saw the remains of a camp fire and thought it looked as if somebody had climbed the tree to break off the lower branches to use as kindling  igor was found next he was dressed but shoeless and lying face down in the snow hugging a birch branch zinaida kolmogorova lay nearby and from the position of her body it seemed as if she had been desperately trying to scramble back uphill towards the tent  there was a long bright red bruise on the rightside of her torso which looked as if it was made by a baton  my guide alexander tells me officially it was stated that the skiers had died of hypothermia and frostbite but some of the other bodies had serious injuries that had nothing to do with them being too cold  rustem slobodin a longdistance runner and one of the shyest in the group was found on 5 march with a fractured skull his body was better dressed than the others found so far he wore a long sleeve undershirt and sweater two pairs of trousers four pairs of socks and one felt boot on his right foot his watch had stopped at 0845  the mystery deepened when the remaining four bodies were found in a ravine in may nearly three months later once the snow had melted nikolai thibeauxbrignolle the son of a french communist repressed by stalin had a fractured skull aleksandr kolevatov the nuclear physics student who had worked at a secret institute in moscow had a wound behind his ear and an oddly twisted neck  lyudmila dubinina the ardent young communist and semyon zolotaryov the oldest member of the group had suffered multiple broken ribs he had an open wound on the right side of his skull which exposed the bone there was another gruesome detail  both had empty eye sockets and lyudmilas tongue was missing  back in sverdlovsk tatyana did not attend her brother igor’s funeral – her parents thought it would be too traumatic for her  “but i saw a photo of him in the coffin afterwards” she says “it was just terrible he looked completely different to what he looked like before my mum said that she only recognised him from the gap between his teeth his hair was grey”  she says that the students’ parents believed that the deaths were somehow related to the military  “what went on up there is hard to say the families were told ‘you will never know the truth so stop asking questions’ so what could we do don’t forget in those days if they told you to shut up you would be silent”
253,i stole a plane to get out of the navy,for two years the bbcs emma jane kirby has been investigating the story of sgt paul meyer a homesick american mechanic who stole a plane from a us airbase in england in 1969 to fly home to his wife in virginia the story resonated with dutch reader theo van eijck who says he too stole a plane while serving in the forces but he survived to tell the tale  theo van eijcks little house in somerset is a treasure trove of curiosities toy witches swing on tiny broomsticks from the ceiling of his sitting room a family of ceramic cats peers down inquiringly from the higher shelves and a couple of skulls sit grinning on the sideboard  but the most fascinating items of all are spread out on van eijcks coffee table  dutch newspaper clippings from 1964 with showstopping headlines reporting the antics of a young sailor who stole a grumman tracker propeller plane from his military base in malta and flew it to benghazi libya  its me laughs van eijck now whitehaired and aged 76 thats me right there in the photo and i was just 21  his wife hands me a mug of coffee and shakes her head in mock despair as he translates the stories for me  arrogant little man she jokes wagging her finger at him good job i didnt know you back then  back then theo van eijck was just a young man who dreamt of flying in fact hed had fantasies about flying since he was seven years old he wasnt he admits the greatest student in the world and feared he would never make the grades needed to join the air force as a pilot but then he heard about a scheme in the dutch navy whereby a young man could enter the service as a trainee electrician and if he did well could apply internally for the navys pilot training course aged just 19 and full of optimism van eijck didnt hesitate he signed up immediately for eight years  he picks up a blackandwhite photograph of himself in the cockpit of a small plane from the coffee table and hands it to me from under a heavy dark helmet i see a boyish face grinning in utter delight impatient to stop posing and eager to take off  oh it started well he agrees when i remark upon how elated he looks in the old print i got selected for the pilot scheme and i loved it  but in early 1964 with around 40 hours flying time stamped proudly into his log book the exhilarated young van eijck went to a party at his barracks in holland and got rather drunk his commanding officer was at the party and also rather the worse for wear he suggested to van eijck that they should talk frankly about the quality of the pilot training scheme which was conducted jointly by the belgian air force and the dutch navy and he invited van eijck to be honest it was he assured him an offtherecord discussion  and so perhaps naively 21yearold van eijck spoke openly he needed to be trained on a proper plane he insisted a grumman tracker submarine destroyer that would be deployed on naval aircraft carriers not the twinengine training planes the belgians were using to teach them the planes they were being taught on were theo grins selfconsciously as he remembers the words he used quite frankly crap  find out more  up to that point van eijck had maintained a perfect flying record but the very next day after the party he had his report card marked with an orange warning sign which meant he was at imminent risk of being failed furious at the injustice he wrote something cocky about the slowness of the training programme on the classroom blackboard while waiting for the instructor to arrive that move saw him jailed at his barracks for a weekend but seeing a skirting board was loose he managed to use it to slide back the bolt across his cell door and escaped when his absence was discovered he was immediately kicked out of the pilots scheme  van eijck was encouraged to appeal against the decision by superiors who admired his gumption but the officers inadvertently gave him the wrong forms to fill in when he finally got a response three months later he was told he had not followed correct procedure and it was now too late to take further action he was no longer to train as a pilot and must serve out his remaining six years in the navy as an electrician  i come from a big family says van eijck who is number nine in a line of 12 brothers and sisters and in the family we knew that right was right and wrong was wrong and this was wrong it just wasnt fair  depressed and despondent with his dreams of flying now shattered van eijck pleaded to be discharged from the navy but his request was repeatedly refused so he started plotting to find a way to extract himself from the force once and for all  i told absolutely noone he smiles coyly if i had told someone it would not have worked  just like sgt paul meyer theo van eijck decided his ticket to freedom was to steal a plane he found a handbook for a grumman tracker plane and hid it in his locker while his friends went out drinking or headed to bed van eijck secretly studied he befriended the qualified pilots and chatted to them about instrument flying about engine startups about takeoffs  image caption the grumman tracker  little did they know why i was interested he sniggers but from holland the route was difficult  i didnt want to end up in east germany with all that political trouble and then one day they asked for volunteers to go on a twomonth exercise in malta with the british navy and i thought from malta i could fly anywhere  in malta van eijck hung around the aerodrome chatting to the aviation mechanics watching them work in the early mornings and evenings he continued to study his now wellthumbed tracker handbook on the last weekend before he was due to fly home he politely attended the farewell party on the base but while his fellow servicemen succumbed to the temptations of the freely flowing liquor the young van eijck was careful to stay completely sober  and thats where my story matches sgt paul meyers he says because the next morning i got up early and i borrowed a bike and biked to the runway sgt meyer told the guard his name was capt epstein i told the one guard on duty i was called jansen  which is like smith in dutch  so he had no idea who i was and he helped me open the doors of the hangar  van eijck had planned his theft meticulously he says even locking up the guards pistol and bike and removing the microphones from the telephone in his office to ensure that if he was rumbled too soon the guard would struggle to get backup  van eijcks blue eyes twinkle as he remembers the thrill of that morning  so i started the engine switched the radio on and the control tower started asking who i was what i was doing i didnt answer i taxied and then…  he rubs his hands together theatrically and shows me his open palms like a magician delighting in performing an elaborate disappearing trick  and then… i was gone  image copyright getty images  and so was the dutch navys grumman tracker submarine destroyer aircraft armed with two torpedoes and heading for north africa  i did worry a bit about the torpedoes admits van eijck but i didnt care because i just wanted out of it no way was the navy going to get me back  flying at 5000 feet over the mediterranean to conserve fuel van eijck was completely alone in the sky  i know how sgt meyer must have felt he says because its what i felt it was the best thing ever youre doing something that everyone says cant be done and its all you all you in this big machine and youre more powerful than anyone else all lonely in that big sky and  he tails off suddenly and i realise hes crying  noone can take it away from you he says choking on his words it was marvellous so powerful i can still feel it now and i was totally convinced i can do this  i remind van eijck that as sgt meyer sat in the cockpit trying to work out where he was going and what he was doing he called his wife on the radio to calm himself i ask van eijck if he thought of his own family as he flew into the unknown  my mother he says quietly yes i thought of my mother a week or so before i had sent her a present it was a silver cross and she guessed i was up to something my mother  van eijck is struggling now to master his tears and asks to pause for a moment so he can drink his coffee the wind chimes suspended from the ceiling knock gently against one another in the breeze slipping in from the open window filling our silence with a jangled staccato music the yellowed newspaper cuttings on the table flutter and curl  image caption dutch newspapers referred to van eijck as a joyvlieger  a joyflyer  for fiveandahalf hours 21yearold theo van eijck flew that plane wondering where might be the safest place to attempt a landing at tripoli the british army still had a presence and nervous of trouble he flew to benghazi where he saw a landing strip with a few huts on either side the strip was full of sheep he says and he had to circle low over it a few times to make sure the animals scattered and cleared the runway for him his landing he recalls proudly was immaculate and he took pleasure in the thought that this would be reported back to his commanding officers  i thought if i can land nicely those navy guys must see i can fly  he picks up his flight log book from the table and shows me the scrawled entry in his own large hand from may 1964 where he defiantly recorded his illicit flight in the hijacked plane on the opposite page someone has overruled the entry writing firmly and in an indignant hand not to be totalled  image caption  and someone objects not to be totalled  strangely the first man who came running out of one of the huts next to the landing strip was a dutch expat who was stunned  and rather alarmed  to see a military plane land on his runway exhausted but still exhilarated van eijck poured out his story however as he related his plans for the future  release from the navy a new civilian life a good job  he noticed his fellow countryman frown and began to realise that perhaps he hadnt thought his plan all the way through the dutchman warned him that he was in big trouble and that if returned to europe he would certainly go to jail  on his compatriots advice van eijck gave himself up to the libyan police whom he remembers roaring enthusiastically up the air strip on harley davidson motorbikes delighted to be taking a dutch hijacker into custody claiming again on the advice of his countryman to have fled europe because he objected to its liberal views on homosexuality and women van eijck was offered political asylum and protection  when the dutch military came to reclaim its awol recruit  and of course to get its stolen plane back  he sometimes refused to see them when he talks now about those power games giggling and grinning its clear that van eijck still relishes the fact that he managed to get one over on the very authorities who had cheated him of his dreams  after a week of negotiations with the dutch ambassador van eijck agreed to a deal he would return to the netherlands a passenger rather than a pilot and would serve a 12month jail term in a state prison for desertion in return he would receive an honourable discharge from the navy  in some of the newspaper clippings on the table van eijck is shown in his immaculate navy uniform standing outside the court in the netherlands his white sailors cap pulled down low over his forehead at first glance he looks like the model sailor  respectable neat and disciplined but study his face closely and you will see just a hint of defiance in his eyes perhaps the faintest traces of scorn across his lips  image copyright anp image caption theo van eijck enjoys a cigarette outside the court  i got what i wanted explains van eijck i wanted to get out of the bloody navy and i got that and i still dont regret what i did  flick past the ignominious page in his flight log book and you will see it is crammed with the details of further flights made in his native holland or in south africa where he lived for many years this time though they are licensed legitimate flights when he left prison van eijck qualified officially as a private pilot  it was all i wanted he shrugs i just wanted to fly  he brings me back to the story of sgt meyer and my investigations into what made him crash in the channel he is convinced that meyer had a lot less experience than he did with instrument flying and rather than being shot down by pursuing british american or french fighter jets he is convinced he just made a simple pilot error  you see they sent three planes after me he says but they went in the wrong direction so they didnt find me but i spoke to the pilots afterwards and they were told only to try to make me talk to them on the radio and to follow them they were never given instructions to shoot me down  and remember i had two torpedoes on board  image copyright alamy image caption theo van eijck after his return to the netherlands  he picks up the helmeted photograph of himself in the cockpit in the halcyon days before he was kicked out of the dutch navys pilot training programme  if you ask me now what i think about it i think what the hell were you doing you bloody fool how did you get such a stupid idea in your head  he smoothes back his white hair  i still cant believe sometimes that i bloody did it  the breeze strengthens and the wind chimes above our heads begin to spill their fractured music again theo van eijck grips my hand and looks at me with wild dancing eyes  but it was marvellous my god it was marvellous  you may also be interested in  in january 2018 greek pilot vasileios vasileiou checked into a luxury hilltop hotel in kabul the intercontinental was popular with

258,japan’s forgotten indigenous people,“this is our bear hut” the short vivacious woman shouted through a handheld loudspeaker her smile creasing her forehead with deep wrinkles a blue hat was perched on her head and her short tunic embroidered with pink geometric designs was tied sharply at the waist she pointed at a wooden structure made of round logs raised high above the ground on stilts  our coverage during coronavirus while travelling is on hold due to the coronavirus outbreak bbc travel will continue to inform and inspire our readers who want to learn about the world as much as they want to travel there offering stories that celebrate the people places and cultures that make this world so wonderfully diverse and amazing for travel information and stories specifically related to coronavirus please read the latest updates from our colleagues at bbc news  “we caught the bears as cubs and raised them as a member of the family they shared our food and lived in our village when the time came we set one free back into nature and killed the other to eat”  having treated the bear well in life her people believe the spirit of the sacred animal which they worship as a deity will ensure the continued good fortune of their community  kimiko naraki is 70 but looks decades younger she is ainu an indigenous people who now live mostly on hokkaido japan’s northernmost island but whose lands once spanned from northern honshu the japanese mainland north to sakhalin and the kuril islands which are now a disputed part of the russian federation the ainu have long been of interest to anthropologists because of their cultural linguistic and physical identity but most travellers will not have heard of them that’s because although they were the earliest settlers of hokkaido they were oppressed and marginalised by japanese rule for centuries  the ainu have had a difficult history their origins are murky but some scholars believe they are descendants of an indigenous population that once spread across northern asia the ainu called hokkaido “ainu moshiri” “land of the ainu” and their original occupation was hunting foraging and fishing like many indigenous people across the world they mainly lived along hokkaido’s warmer southern coast and traded with the japanese but after the meiji restoration about 150 years ago people from mainland japan started emigrating to hokkaido as japan colonised the northernmost island and discriminatory practices such as the 1899 hokkaido former aborigines protection act displaced the ainu from their traditional lands to the mountainous barren area in the island’s centre  “it’s a very ugly story” said professor kunihiko yoshida law professor at hokkaido university  forced into agriculture they were no longer able to fish for salmon in their rivers and hunt deer on their land yoshida said they were required to adopt japanese names speak the japanese language and were slowly stripped of their culture and traditions including their beloved bear ceremony due to the wide stigmatisation many ainu hid their ancestry and the longterm effects are clear to see today with much of the ainu population remaining poor and politically disenfranchised with much of their ancestral knowledge lost  among other nefarious practices japanese researchers ransacked ainu graves from the late 19th century to the 1960s amassing huge collections of ainu remains for their study and never returning the bones  recently however things have started to look up for the ainu in april 2019 they were legally recognised as an indigenous people of japan by the japanese government after many years of deliberation which has resulted in a more positive appreciation of ainu culture and renewed pride in their language and heritage  it is important to protect the honour and dignity of the ainu people and to hand those down to the next generation to realise a vibrant society with diverse values said government spokesman yoshihide suga as reported in the straits times  naraki continued showing us around the ainu kotan village still smiling she pointed to a wooden cupboardlike structure “this is the toilet for the men” she said giggling next to it was a smaller teepeestyle hut “and this one is for the women”  i want to tell the world that japan has indigenous people  naraki leads tours of this kotan to teach visitors about her culture it is part of the sapporo pirka kotan ainu culture promotion centre japan’s first municipal facility featuring indigenous people where visitors can experience ainu handicrafts watch traditional dancing and imagine traditional ainu life when this area was a vast wilderness and the people lived on and with the land located approximately 40 minutes by car from downtown sapporo hokkaido’s capital city the centre was opened in 2003 to teach both other japanese and foreign visitors about ainu culture and spread their message to the world  “97 of ainu are underground but the people who come here to events are very proud of their culture” said jeffry gayman an educational anthropologist at hokkaido university who has been working with the ainu for 15 years  the pride is especially evident in the centre’s small wellkept museum where ainu artefacts such as traditional clothing and tools are carefully displayed upstairs are rooms where visitors can join workshops on ainu embroidery or learn how to make the traditional ainu musical instrument mukkuri a bamboo mouth harp by hosting events members of the community are able to educate the wider world on their history and situation  “if i try to tell people about ainu rights and empowerment noone is interested but when people see our dancing or music it makes them interested in learning more about us” explained ryoko tahara an ainu activist and president of the ainu women’s association  you may also be interested in  • japans mysterious lake of the gods  • the indigenous communities that predicted covid19  • japans formula for life satisfaction  although this centre is a significant step in sharing ainu culture nationally and internationally noone lives here the kotan is a replica to show people what traditional ainu life was like only a few isolated neighbourhood pockets of ainu people remain scattered across hokkaido with most of the estimated 20000 ainu there are no official figures assimilated into cities and towns around the island  however travellers who look carefully will be able to see traces of their culture everywhere many place names in hokkaido have ainu origins such as “sapporo” which comes from the ainu words sat dry poro large and pet river due to its location around the toyohira river or “shiretoko” – a peninsula that sticks out from hokkaido’s northeastern tip – which can be translated as “of the ground” siri and “protruding point” etuk  and ainu pride is visible at events like the annual marimo festival at lake akan and the shakushain festival in shizunai and in groups like the ainu art project a 40member group that share ainu culture through their ainu and rock fusion band and handmade arts and crafts restaurants such as kerapirka in sapporo serve up traditional ainu food and act as a hub for the local community  “and you can see ainu values in any settings where ainu people gather whether that be inside their home at a local town gathering or an event but you need to know what you’re looking for” said gayman explaining that “generosity and hospitality” are core ainu principles “they’re lighthearted people” he said  the ainu have also become more prominent on the national stage with activist kayano shigeru elected to the japanese parliament in 1994 where he served five terms and the hugely popular manga series golden kamuy pushing ainu culture into the national spotlight over the last couple of years  “in the last few years people have become more interested in the ainu it has become a hot topic in japan” said tahara “that makes me proud that people will know about the ainu but there is still work to be done”  the latest step forward for this community is the symbolic space for ethnic harmony in shiraoi hokkaido a new complex currently under construction by the government to showcase ainu culture made up of a national ainu museum the national park for ethnic harmony and a memorial facility it was scheduled to open in april 2020 in time for the olympics but has been delayed due to covid19  the recognition is very symbolic but not so meaningful  however many experts believe that the recent recognition of the community is not enough saying it is merely lipservice by the government with the new ainu bill failing to provide japan’s indigenous people with clear and strong rights  “the ainu still cannot fish their salmon and dams are still being built that submerge sacred sites” said yoshida “there’s no selfdetermination no collective rights and no reparations it’s just a cultural performance”  “the recognition is very symbolic but not so meaningful” he added with a sad laugh noting that japan is far behind the world standard in treatment of indigenous people “it’s a shameful situation that’s the reality”  as i followed naraki on her tour of the kotan it seemed clear however that public interest in ainu culture is strong groups of japanese people and other visitors who’d arrived by busload from sapporo jostled for pictures in front of the pu the hut for storing food which is located directly opposite the porociset where the village chiefs lived in order to keep a stern eye on the village’s communal larder “the elders would resolve any disputes in the village” naraki said if no one could agree they would discuss for three days and three nights and then make a decision  she explained how the ainu’s lives were tied to the land kotans would be constructed along rivers or by the sea where water was plentiful and safe from natural disasters food was foraged or hunted with staple proteins including salmon deer and bear they would pick wild grasses vegetables mushrooms and berries such as kitopiro alpine leek and shikerepe berries of the amur cork tree never picking everything at once and always leaving the roots so the plants could keep growing food was simple with animal oil kelp and salt the only flavourings and millet their main grain clothes were made with animal or fish skin or woven with tree bark or nettle fibres  living in harmony with nature is a way of life that many ainu would like to return to “eventually what i want is to get back some land so we can hunt and fish freely as well as do our traditional farming” tahara told me increasing numbers of ainu are also starting to relearn their language which is linguistically isolated and declared as critically endangered by unesco  what are your other hopes for the future i asked tahara  “i want to tell the world that japan has indigenous people people don’t know” she said “i want us all to respect each other to treat each other respectfully and live peacefully in this country and of course i would like our ancestors’ bones returned bring them back to the graves they were taken

go home  they werent always alone  some had young children and others had pregnant wives and the life they had built for themselves packed into their ragtag bags  many never made it here the bbc tells

all of us  indeed it was sanju that encouraged rajan to push himself  i used to do an eighthour shift in a factory sanju motivated me do something more so we bought a food cart and started selling snacks from 1600 to 2200  she pushed me to think big she used to say that having our business was way better than a job job had a fixed salary but business allowed us to grow  two years ago all the

died on the spot rajan and nitin escaped with minor injuries  it all ended so quickly rajan says we were so close to our village we were so excited but i have nothing left now  just a big void  he

the lockdown began and the cousins both found their savings quickly ran out  lallu ram called his family to say they were coming home  at least he would now get to spend time with his children he said  and so lallu ram and ajay kumar joined the desperate scramble to find a way home to the village in uttar pradeshs allahabad district some 1400km away  but the price demanded by lorry drivers proved too much instead inspired by the migrants walking home they saw on the television they packed small bags and began the journey on foot with four friends  image caption many migrants say they dont want to come back to cities  the covered around 400km in the first 48 hours  hitchhiking in lorries along the way but the journey was more difficult than they had imagined  it was really hot and we would

his children  the familys only breadwinner is gone says ajay kumar nobody helped us my cousin didnt have to die  but it was a choice between hunger and the long journey  we poor people often have to

sigh of relief maybe everything was going to be all right after all  but three days later on thursday 14 may the number of new covidpositive patients had shot up to 30  its just one figure and in normal times we might discount it as random variation however these are times of alertness and every flicker of the covid dashboard needle triggers nervous anticipation of a possible spike  there is a delay between infection and symptoms usually about fivetoseven days so these cases would have been incubating since the week before  and possibly since the communal gatherings on ve day six days

289,coronavirus can india replace china as worlds factory,image copyright getty images image caption india feels chinas weakened global position could be a blessing in disguise  with covid19 infecting millions across the world china is facing an unprecedented global backlash that could destabilise its reign as the worlds factory of choice  its neighbour india has sensed an opportunity and is keen to make inroads to a space it hopes china will vacate sooner rather than later  chinas weakened global position is a blessing in disguise for india to attract more investment transport minister nitin gadkari said in a recent interview the northern state of uttar pradesh which has a population the size of brazil is already forming an economic task force to attract firms keen to ditch china  india is also readying a pool of land twice the size of luxembourg to offer companies that want to move manufacturing out of china and has reached out to 1000 american multinationals bloomberg reported  this outreach has been an ongoing process deepak bagla chief executive of invest india the governments national investment promotion agency told the bbc covid will only accelerate the process of derisking from china for many of these companies  the usindia business council usibc a powerful lobby group that works to enhance investment flows between india and the us also said that india has significantly stepped up its pitch  we are seeing india prioritise efforts to attract supply chains both at central and state government level nisha biswal president of usibc and the former assistant secretary of state for south and central asian affairs in the us department of state told the bbc  companies that already have some manufacturing in india may be earlier movers in reducing output in plants in china and scaling up in production in india  image copyright getty images image caption indian government agencies are trying to woo multinationals from the us  but things are still at an evaluation stage and decisions are unlikely to be made in a hurry she added  in an environment where global balance sheets are fractured relocating entire supply chains is easier said than done  many of these companies are facing severe cash and capital constraints because of the pandemic and will therefore be very cautious before making quick moves independent economist rupa subramanya said  according to rahul jacob a longtime china watcher and former financial times bureau chief in hong kong the indian government putting together land banks is a step in the right direction but large companies are unlikely to move their operations just because land is made available  production lines and supply chains are far more sticky than most people seem to understand it is very difficult to pull them apart overnight he said  china offers integrated infrastructure like large ports and highways top quality labour and sophisticated logistics all of which are critical factors to meet strict deadlines that international companies operate on  image copyright getty images image caption can india match chinas integrated infrastructure capabilities  another reason india might not be the obvious choice for global multinationals is because it isnt well integrated with major global supply chains  last year delhi pulled out of a crucial multilateral trade agreement with 12 other asian countries collectively known as the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep despite seven years of negotiations decisions like these make it difficult for indian exporters to benefit from tarifffree access to destination markets or offer reciprocity to its trading partners  why would i make something that i want to sell to singapore in india being connected in trade agreements institutionally is as important as offering competitive prices parag khanna author of the future is asian told the bbc  regional integration is particularly crucial he believes as global trade begins to follow the sell where you make model where companies socalled nearsource rather than outsource production and bring it closer to demand  indias volatile relationship with foreign direct investment fdi and uneven regulation is also something that continues to bother global companies  from prohibiting ecommerce companies to sell nonessential items and tweaking fdi rules to disallow easier capital flows from neighbouring countries the fear is that india has used the pandemic to build protectionist walls around itself  in a recent address to the nation indian prime minister narendra modi made be vocal for local his rallying cry new stimulus proposals meanwhile have increased thresholds for foreign companies bidding for indian contracts  the more that india can improve regulatory stability the better its chances of persuading more global businesses to establish hubs in india says mr biswal  so then who if not india  as things stand vietnam bangladesh south korea and taiwan seem to be favourites to benefit from the backlash against china the latter two at the hightech end of the spectrum and vietnam and bangladesh at the lower end according to mr jacob  image copyright getty images image caption president trump has blamed china for not doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus  multinationals began moving production out of china into these countries nearly a decade ago due to rising labour and environmental costs the slow exodus has only gathered pace as uschina trade tensions have increased in recent years  since june 2018 a month before the trade war began us goods imports from vietnam have soared by more than 50 and those from taiwan by 30 according to calculations made by the south china morning post newspaper  india is seen to have lost out because it failed to create conditions allowing multinationals to supply not only the local market but also to use the country as a production base to export to the world  in recent weeks several states have begun making moves to address some concerns around the ease of doing business  prime among them being making contentious changes to indias archaic labour laws put in place to reduce exploitation  uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh states for instance have suspended significant labour protections exempting factories from even maintaining basic requirements like cleanliness ventilation lighting and toilets  image copyright getty images image caption some indian states have stripped away laws that gave labourers basic protections  the intention is to improve the investment climate and attract global capital  but such decisions could become counterproductive and hurt rather than help says mr jacob international companies would be very wary about this they have strict codes of conduct on labour environment and safety standards for suppliers  the 2013 collapse of the rana plaza garment factory in bangladesh that supplied retailers like walmart was a turning point it forced bangladesh to significantly improve factory infrastructure and safety to clinch more investment he cautions  india has to follow better standards these are white board ideas drafted on powerpoint by bureaucrats who are completely divorced from the reality of global trade  but with the us weighing punitive action against china japan paying its corporations to move out of the country and uk lawmakers coming under pressure to reconsider their decision to allow chinese telecoms giant huawei a role in building the countrys new 5g data network global antichina sentiment is increasing  the time is ripe say experts for india to undertake broadbased structural reforms and use these sweeping geopolitical shifts to modify its trading relationship with the world

the procedure with an nhs transplant team of experts and psychologists  i was probably in denial i try my best at everything i was just feeling upset with myself and i was scared id never had a proper operation before  you work towards it you have every test imaginable so they can match up the organ with you and its just about keeping busy and focused and trying to see the best in myself  and there are mixed emotions which can depend on how you feel each day  one distraction is her online fashion business which came about because she had struggled to find dresses to fit because her rib cage is

drilling rig where his father desperate for his wayward son to shape up sent him to work one summer  against my wishes i went and it changed my life says mr bloxsom now 63 years old and the president of fort apache energy a small company that operates oil and gas wells in texas and louisiana i was hooked  that was decades ago since then his home state of texas has more than doubled its crude oil output helping to turn the us into the worlds biggest oil producer  but as oil prices tumble  briefly falling below zero in a first last month  following a dramatic drop in energy demand because of the covid19 pandemic the industry is going into reverse  giants such as exxon and chevron and fracking firms such as diamondback energy have shut in wells and slashed investment in recent weeks helping drive down us crude oil production by nearly one million barrels per day from march to april  the third largest monthly decline in a century  mr bloxsom cut his typical output of 800 barrels per day by more than half others have gone even further  right now everything i have is shut down everything says bill d graham president of midland texasbased incline energy which has 80 wells that in more typical times would about 275 barrels per day  transformational crisis  the supply cuts are not unique to the us  image copyright afp image caption oil producers have started enacting major cutbacks  the international energy agency expects global oil supply to fall to a nineyear low this month as producers around the world reduce output in response to prices that dropped by more than twothirds in april before starting to stabilise  but even before the coronavirus pandemic hit the industry was experiencing a supply glut  driven by the us boom  that had depressed prices and prompted strains in oilproducing texas and elsewhere the wall street money that helped power the fracking growth had grown harder to come by while big firms were promoting investments in renewable energy  forecasters at ihs markit say supply is unlikely to return to 2019 levels until at least 2023 there is a chance that 2019 will have been the high point for global output should the pandemic permanently reduce energy demand  for example by increasing telework and reducing business travel  this is a transformational crisis for the world and what happens to oil will be shaped by the broader forces of change that are coming out of covid19 says jim burkhard the firms head of oil market research  theres enough of these variables in play where you dont have to have a doomsday view of the world to consider that oil demand could have peaked in 2019 thats not our base case but it is our alternative scenario  i see it going away completely  in the us several large us companies have already filed for bankruptcy with more expected in a sector where debt levels were already dangerously high services firms desperate to survive the crisis have cut more than 66000 jobs  almost 10 of total employment  with more reductions likely the petroleum equipment  services association industry group estimates  image copyright bill graham image caption bill graham says the crisis is likely to force out many small firms like his  as healthier businesses scoop up the assets of distressed rivals the industry is likely to emerge with fewer firms and fewer workers  the future for the small operator like me  i see it going away completely says mr graham  mr graham whose father started incline energy in 1966 says he managed to keep his five staff after securing government coronavirus rescue money but if the price his oil fetches  which for now is lower than figure traded on financial markets  does not bounce back above 25 by october those jobs are at risk  with the wells shut in and zero income were just going to have to play a waiting game and see how long we can last the 66yearold says  government bailout  us president donald trump has pledged his support for the oil industry and opened government storage facilities so that producers do not have to sell at a loss due to lack of storage as happened in april the federal reserve has also adjusted its coronavirus relief programmes to make sure energy firms qualify  image copyright getty images image caption storage shortages helped turn us oil prices negative last month in a first  but democrats backed by

deplorable to send good money after bad massachusetts senator ed markey wrote after the feds changes  leslie beyer president of industry group petroleum equipment  services association says many of her members are already working on renewables and cleaner energy technology she calls those who hope the pandemic will spell the demise of the industry misguided noting that global population growth and economic development in poor countries will drive continuing demand for oil  some people who dont understand the way the industry works  think now is the time to transition entirely to renewables there is definitely room for renewables and we need to increase those but we dont go zero to 60 she says  its important that we dont give up on the ingenuity that created the shale boom thats what put us in the great position that were in as the worlds largest producer  we need to maintain that  but the best days of the industry may be over mr bloxsom says pointing to the scarcity of young people at conferences  i have told all four of my kids do not go into the oil patch he says do something else

305,the best trees to reduce air pollution,cities usually come at the price of green space since prehistoric times humans have busily cleared forests to make way for settlements but increasingly greenery has been edging its way back into modern urban landscapes and for good reason vegetation helps cities become better habitats for wildlife and for people and it helps to make city air safer  trees have a remarkable range of traits that can help reduce urban air pollution and cities around the world are looking to harness them in january 2019 the mayor of london announced that 7000 trees would be planted before the end of the following year meanwhile china’s hebei province home to beijing has been working on a “green necklace” of plants that could help reduce pollution from factories that surround the capital and paris is planning an urban forest that will encompass its most iconic landmarks in an effort to adapt to climate change and also improve the city’s air quality  while trees are generally effective at reducing air pollution it isn’t as simple as the more trees you have in an urban space the better the air will be some trees are markedly more effective at filtering pollutants from the air than others to make the most difference in air quality in a street or city it has to be the right tree for the job  you might also like  and of course trees are only a way to filter pollution better is to reduce emissions of pollutants in the first place notes david nowak a senior scientist at the us forest service who has been studying plants’ contribution to air quality for 30 years “but trees can be of great help” he says  trees can improve air quality in direct and indirect ways indirectly they can help by shading surfaces and reducing temperatures if buildings are shaded by trees it reduces the need for conventional air conditioning and the emissions of greenhouse gases that come with it plus lower temperatures decrease risk of harmful pollutants like ground level ozone that commonly spike on hot days in urban areas
306,dark web scammers exploit covid19 fear and doubt,image copyright getty images  theyre exploiting the fear uncertainty and doubt people are experiencing during the pandemic and using the anxiety and desperation to get people to buy things or click on things they wouldnt have otherwise says morgan wright a former senior adviser to the us department of state antiterrorism assistance programme  hes talking about the scammers and criminals that inhabit the dark web who have found a new angle  anxiety over covid19  mr wright who is now chief security adviser at security software company sentinelone used to teach behavioural analysts at the us national security agency nsa about the exploitation of human behaviour  he is now seeing some of those techniques being used on the dark web an encrypted part of the internet that can be accessed using popular networks such as tor  the tor browser is privacyfocused meaning it can obscure who is using it and what data is being accessed it offers bad actors a way to operate with a degree of impunity as law enforcement find it much more difficult to track down criminals that use it  image copyright morgan wright image caption mr wright used to teach behavioural analysts at the us national security agency nsa  since the beginning of the global pandemic marketplaces on the dark web have seen a rise in covid19 related products and services soughtafter n95 masks gowns gloves and the drug chloroquine have all been listed on these marketplaces last month security software firm intsights found blood allegedly belonging to recovered coronavirus patients was even being offered for sale  criminals hope a heightened sense of fear will make people rush to buy these products and as a result these items are not cheap an australian institute of criminology report found the average fake vaccine was being sold for about 370 £300 while one supposedly sourced from china was selling for between 1015000 £812000  one of the reasons for the rise in such sales may be because many fraudsters are having to turn from their normal methods of making money on the dark web  such as selling fake flights booked using stolen airmiles  because these industries are currently dormant  many criminals also see an opportunity  as the majority of people are working from home there is a greater chance of lax cyber security in place  there was suddenly a huge shift on the dark web of talking about vulnerabilities in collaboration software when they realised people were going to be working from home says intsights chief security officer etay maor  more technology of business  phishing scams have also been on the rise these are where fraudsters pretend to be a different organisation or person by email hoping the person will provide some login details or personal data which can then be used to steal money or someones identity  the phishing attacks started with those pretending to be from the nhs and then extended to secondary organisations that are related to covid19 like banks or hmrc emailing about funding grants or being furloughed says javvad malik security advocate at training company knowbe4  now there are covid19 related phishing templates making their way into all of the phishing kits that are available on the dark web  meaning people can imitate apple or linkedin with a set of standard templates he adds  in addition many services and products including phishing kits are being offered at discount in coronavirus sales  there are people who have been specialising in phishing pages shady vpns or spamming services for a number of years who are now offering discounts because they believe its the best time to make money and spread these kits says liv rowley threat intelligence analyst at blueliv a computer and network security firm  image copyright blueliv image caption intelligence analyst liv rowley monitors dark web scammers  the dark web was designed by the us naval research laboratory with the idea of enabling human rights activists and people within the military to talk and collaborate in a secure anonymous way  while the introduction of bitcoin enabled criminals to make money on the dark web there remains a huge number of users that opt to use it for its initial purpose  speaking to others anonymously on forums  according to mr malik these forums have often been used to fuel conspiracy theories around the virus  conspiracies about 5g being the vehicle of this virus or bioweaponry or that bill gates is the man behind it tend to crop up on the dark web he says  as social media companies and other news outlets crack down on misinformation many others may be pushed onto the dark web these forums often act as a gateway to marketplaces for people to plug their products or services to a targeted audience this could be a way for fraudsters to make further money in the months to come  image copyright javvad malik image caption conspiracy theories flourish on the dark web says javvad malik  the flipside to this is that many journalists activists and citizens may be using the dark web to communicate in countries where there is a lot of censorship tor versions of many news outlets including the bbc and new york times may be used if the original sites are blocked by governments or states for instance  netblocks a digital rights advocacy group says that many countries have cut access to the web in different ways as they seek to control the flow of information about the coronavirus outbreak  two ransomware groups had said they would not attack any hospitals or healthcare organisations during the pandemic but as foreign secretary dominic raab outlined in a recent press briefing there is evidence that criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations that are responding to the pandemic  including hospitals  these organisations are targeted because of how vulnerable they are at this time and because of the likelihood that a ransom would be paid says charity wright cyber threat intelligence adviser at intsights  the coordination and orchestration of many of these attacks often begin on the dark web  image copyright intsights image caption dark web scammers are targeting healthcare says etay maor  we are seeing more offerings on the dark web specifically for healthcarerelated information and for targeting healthcare facilities and doctors theres even a database someone has created on the dark web with all kinds of information about medical staff says etay maor from intsights  at its core the dark web may still be being used for the same reasons it was intended to be used for  from a privacy and security perspective but criminals are using this to try to exploit a global crisis for financial gain  thats the doubleedged sword that as a society we havent quite worked out how do we safeguard freedom of speech and ensure privacy but at the same time track down and stop people abusing those freedoms says javvad malik

335,climate change scientists fear car surge will see co2 rebound,image copyright pa media  daily global emissions of co2 fell by 17 at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to covid19 say scientists  the most comprehensive account yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys  but the authors are worried that as people return to work car use will soar again  they fear co2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis  they are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real durable changes on transport and personal mobility  in the uk transport secretary grant shapps has pledged £250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure other countries are also looking at similar plans  the lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to covid19 have had a significant impact on the carbonproducing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do  road transport has declined hugely as has aviation  however now that the uk is beginning to return to work mr shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport should walking or cycling not be an option  if you cant walk or cycle but you do have access to a car please use it rather than travelling by bus train or tram he said  industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed  now in detailed analysis researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of co2  theyve calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97 of global emissions  during the peak of the crisis in early april daily emissions dropped by 17 compared to the previous year meaning around 17 million tonnes less co2 were emitted every day  the key to the fall has been cars surface transport emissions have declined by 43 the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined  while the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact it only accounts for 10 of the decrease during the pandemic  china has been responsible for the biggest drop followed by the us europe and india  if some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year then global emissions will likely drop by 7  if prepandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by midjune the annual fall would be around 4  but the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound especially on the roads could see a carbon surge  analysis  roger harrabin environment analyst  lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants too one of the uks leading experts prof frank kelly from kings college london said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised  fully two years before us authorities exposed the scandal  he told radio 4s the life scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road  prof kelly said he reported it to the department for environment food and rural affairs defra but they didnt publish his findings he said work undertaken subsequently in the us led to legal action against car makers that had installed defeat devices to fool regulators  the government didnt deny the account a spokesperson said we are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our clean air strategy has been commended by the world health organization as an example for the rest of the world to follow  meanwhile on the covid19 crisis he said levels of the pollutant no2 had fallen by up to 60 in london since the fall in traffic under lockdown  levels of another pollutant sooty particles remained at harmful concentrations  a big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before once everybody goes back said prof corinne le quéré from the university of east anglia who led the analysis  the researchers say that fundamental systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change  when it comes to transportation there are huge opportunities according to prof le quéré  she says that after the global financial crisis in 2008 some governments like china us and germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables  image copyright getty images image caption airlines have been hit hard economically but the slowdown in flying hasnt hugely impacted emissions  here now in 2020 were very close to the same situation in electric mobility she told bbc news  battery prices have come down we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies  so if these two things can align then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow  grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change  a letter signed by 155 major companies representing 24 trillion £196 trillion in market capitalisation calls for a netzero emissions response to the covid crisis  corporations including carlsberg iberdrola edf and coca cola europe say they want governments to prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy  image copyright getty images image caption electric cars may be the best way forward for transportation scientists believe  the authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action they point to the fact that while emissions of co2 may be temporarily reduced all the while co2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere warming the planet  it will take a a dramatic shift to change that  i think very much that we are at a crossroads and at this point like the uk prime minister boris johnson said it could go either way  he was talking about his own health but here were talking about the health of the planet  it could go either way  the study

339,nature crisis moths have secret role as crucial pollinators,image copyright getty images  long seen as annoying creatures that can leave holes in your clothes moths have been badly misjudged say scientists  new research suggests they play a vital role as overnight pollinators of a wide range of flowers and plants  the study says that the moths transport networks are larger and more complex than those of daytime pollinators like bees  the authors believe there is an urgent need to stem declines in moth numbers  over the past decade public anxiety about the role of our pollinators has focused squarely on bees  the falloff in their numbers linked to changes in land and widespread use of pesticides has helped raise environmental awareness of the critical role these creatures play in the food chain  moths though have not evoked similar sympathies  theres this big misconception that all moths come and eat my clothes thats not what happens at all said dr richard walton from university college london ucl the lead author of the new study  image copyright getty images image caption a magpie moth was one of the species examined in the study  some of them happen to be visiting flowers and can be an important part of the pollination process  to find out how vital a part the moths play dr walton and colleagues monitored moth activity around ponds in agricultural areas of norfolk  they found that 45 of the moths they tested were transporting pollen which originated from 47 different plant species including several that were rarely visited by bees hoverflies and butterflies  the scientists found that while bumblebees and honeybees are critically important they tended to target the most prolific nectar and pollen sources not so with moths  from what we see from our work moths tend to be generalists meaning theyre not specifically visiting a narrow group of flowers said dr walton  theyre kind of visiting any type of flower that they can access these tend to be the open cupshaped flowers like bramble they can access things from the legume family the clover family was also very important  hairy bodies  previous studies on moths have tended to focus on their ability to transport pollen via their proboscis or nose this new work looked at the pollen collected on the moths distinctly hairy bodies when they sit on flowers while feeding  image copyright magnum photos  the researchers believe their study shows that moths complement the work of daytime pollinators and help keep plant populations diverse and abundant they serve as a form of backup for biodiversity which in turn supports crop yields  the vital role played by the moths has come under increasing threat as they have suffered steep declines in numbers since the 1970s this is largely due to changes in land use and the increasing use of pesticides  this has a knockon effect for birds that feed on moths such as the cuckoo its decline is kind of tied to moth declines said dr walton  bats will feed on moths as well so theres ties to other creatures having declines in their own populations because their food supply the moths are going down as well you can see this kind of linkage play out  helping the moths will require the use of less pesticide and encouraging a wider diversity of plants in the landscape  but perhaps more importantly the public perception of moths needs to change  something thats out of sight is often out of mind said dr walton  image copyright getty images image caption pollination by bees is critically important but they are not they only species involved  we just see bees in the daytime and we see them visiting the flower so theyve got the better shift when when it comes to work in terms of being visible  but moths are by no means less important i think its vital to raise the profile of moths to help the public at large see the important part they play in our ecology  the study has been published in the royal society journal biology letters  follow matt on twitter

341,coronavirus bumpy ride as message gets more complicated,media playback is unsupported on your device media caption boris johnson speaks of the good solid british common sense to combat coronavirus  boris johnson wasnt short of words last night when he spoke to the country  but he was short on detail about exactly how the gradual easing of the lockdown will work in england in the coming weeks and months  it might not sound like much but a gap of even a few hours between saying changes were on the way and spelling out precisely what they were was enough to create lots of question marks among members of the public  and political anxiety too tensions with the devolved governments and interestingly private worries on the tory backbenches  through the course of the day however forests of paper emerged in government documents that have gone a long way to fill in some of the blanks  and its worth reading about all of the tweaks to the rules in england here  notably tonight the tuc the umbrella union organisation said the plans were a step in the right direction and with the help of the governments most senior scientists the prime minister had to answer some of the questions from the public directly on primetime tv  there are still anomalies but ministers have gone some way to answer some of the doubts  but in this new phase where lockdown is at the start of a phased withdrawal the message will continue to be more complicated for the government to communicate  the sequencing on this first outing of the new message and alert system has been bumpy too  and as part of this next era it will become more contingent on the public to make decisions for themselves  its easy for the prime minister to say its a case of british common sense harder to make sure that happens without division and discontent  the broad political consensus that has largely cushioned the government so far has been punctured  some of the latitude the governments been given in this emergency has gone

344,the man who bought 60000 oil and gas wells,image copyright billy brown image caption rusty hutson initially didnt want to work in the energy sector  the bbcs weekly the boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world this week we speak to rusty hutson jr founder and chief executive of us energy firm diversified gas  oil dgo  in the end rusty hutson jr couldnt escape the calling of the family trade  born and raised in a bluecollar household in the oil and gas fields of west virginia his father grandfather and greatgrandfather all earned their livings in the energy sector  they worked at the wells and on the pipelines putting in a hard shift of manual labour day after day year after year to provide for their families  during his summer holidays from high school and then college rusty would go to work with his dad  but when he became the first hutson to graduate from university in 1991 he decided he wanted to do something completely different with his life  image copyright dgo image caption rusty third left now employs 925 people  i decided that going into oil and gas was about the last thing i wanted to do he says i didnt want a part of it when i got out its really hard work  so armed with an accountancy degree from west virginias fairmont state university he went off to have a successful banking career for the next decade ending up in birmingham alabama  but as the years progressed rusty says it started to nag at him that he hadnt followed his dad into the family industry  west virginia was a tough state when i was growing up still is he says and there were two kinds of people  you either worked in coal or you worked in oil and gas it was a generational thing  if your dad and grandfather did it for a living then you did it  and as the years progressed i increasingly felt drawn back to that world i also had this desire to build something to do something entrepreneurial  so in 2001 aged 32 rusty bought an old gas well back in west virginia for 250000 £200000 he raised the money by remortgaging his home  it was a small old well it had been in production for years but it was like gold to me he says i spent the next four years still also working in the bank but any spare time i had id fly up to west virginia to work alongside the one well tender that i had back then  image copyright dgo image caption rusty says his first gas well felt like finding gold  fastforward to today and rustys company dgo now owns more than 60000 gas and oil wells across west virginia pennsylvania ohio kentucky virginia and tennessee a region called the appalachia employing 925 people it has annual revenues of more than 500m some 90 of its operation is natural gas with 10 oil  the companys business model is a very specific one  it doesnt do any drilling to find new oil and gas reserves instead it buys up old oil and gas wells that bigger producers no longer want because the initial large flow levels have fallen to low volumes  they dont want these old wells but the average remaining life on most of these wells is 50 years he says so we can come in run them very efficiently and make money  rusty says that dgo has been greatly helped by the socalled dash for shale in the us over the past decade whereby oil and gas firms gave up traditional oil and gas wells to switch to fracking instead  in very simple terms unlike traditional wells where oil and gas is sucked up fracking involves first injecting a high pressure mixture of water sand and chemicals into shale rock this fractures the rock and allows the removal of vast quantities of oil and gas that wasnt previously accessible  rusty says the industrywide move to fracking and its higher production volumes meant that dgo has been able to buy thousands of old but still productive traditional wells cheaply and rapidly expand the business  image copyright getty images image caption while the business is 90 gas it does have nodding donkeys at its oil wells  to help raise funds for continuing expansion in 2017 the company decided to go public and sell its shares on a stock exchange in an unusual move for a us firm rusty chose the london stock exchanges lses alternative investment market  we werent big enough at the time to float in the us he says and i didnt want to go down the private equity route because i didnt want to work for somebody else and try to earn back some of the percentage  more the boss features  dgo is now in the process of moving up to the main market of the lse  energy sector analyst james mccormack of cenkos securities says that dgos strategy of acquiring lowcost longlife lowdecline oil and gas production is a virtually unique proposition  he adds under rustys leadership dgo has grown rapidly since its ipo initial public offering in february 2017 increasing production 20 times and reserves 23 times  image copyright gaylon wampler image caption rustys dad pictured has a senior role at the company  fellow energy analyst carlos gomes of edison says that dgo is now the largest conventional gas producer in the appalachia region the company possesses longlife low operational cost mature producing assets that generate very stable cash flows he adds  the longterm plan at dgo is to keep buying wells to replace any that eventually come to the end of production and rusty says the firm is now looking to expand into other regions such as down in texas  in the more immediate term he says that he is relaxed about the big falls in oil and gas prices since the start of the coronavirus pandemic both because he has longterm hedges or agreements in place on what price he sells his production for and because his business operates more efficiently than its larger rivals  he can also turn to his dad for help and advice his father rusty sr is the supervisor for the companys northern west virginia operation  hes 72 and he just absolutely loves it says rusty does he try to tell me what to do oh absolutely

358,coronavirus can india replace china as worlds factory,image copyright getty images image caption india feels chinas weakened global position could be a blessing in disguise  with covid19 infecting millions across the world china is facing an unprecedented global backlash that could destabilise its reign as the worlds factory of choice  its neighbour india has sensed an opportunity and is keen to make inroads to a space it hopes china will vacate sooner rather than later  chinas weakened global position is a blessing in disguise for india to attract more investment transport minister nitin gadkari said in a recent interview the northern state of uttar pradesh which has a population the size of brazil is already forming an economic task force to attract firms keen to ditch china  india is also readying a pool of land twice the size of luxembourg to offer companies that want to move manufacturing out of china and has reached out to 1000 american multinationals bloomberg reported  this outreach has been an ongoing process deepak bagla chief executive of invest india the governments national investment promotion agency told the bbc covid will only accelerate the process of derisking from china for many of these companies  the usindia business council usibc a powerful lobby group that works to enhance investment flows between india and the us also said that india has significantly stepped up its pitch  we are seeing india prioritise efforts to attract supply chains both at central and state government level nisha biswal president of usibc and the former assistant secretary of state for south and central asian affairs in the us department of state told the bbc  companies that already have some manufacturing in india may be earlier movers in reducing output in plants in china and scaling up in production in india  image copyright getty images image caption indian government agencies are trying to woo multinationals from the us  but things are still at an evaluation stage and decisions are unlikely to be made in a hurry she added  in an environment where global balance sheets are fractured relocating entire supply chains is easier said than done  many of these companies are facing severe cash and capital constraints because of the pandemic and will therefore be very cautious before making quick moves independent economist rupa subramanya said  according to rahul jacob a longtime china watcher and former financial times bureau chief in hong kong the indian government putting together land banks is a step in the right direction but large companies are unlikely to move their operations just because land is made available  production lines and supply chains are far more sticky than most people seem to understand it is very difficult to pull them apart overnight he said  china offers integrated infrastructure like large ports and highways top quality labour and sophisticated logistics all of which are critical factors to meet strict deadlines that international companies operate on  image copyright getty images image caption can india match chinas integrated infrastructure capabilities  another reason india might not be the obvious choice for global multinationals is because it isnt well integrated with major global supply chains  last year delhi pulled out of a crucial multilateral trade agreement with 12 other asian countries collectively known as the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep despite seven years of negotiations decisions like these make it difficult for indian exporters to benefit from tarifffree access to destination markets or offer reciprocity to its trading partners  why would i make something that i want to sell to singapore in india being connected in trade agreements institutionally is as important as offering competitive prices parag khanna author of the future is asian told the bbc  regional integration is particularly crucial he believes as global trade begins to follow the sell where you make model where companies socalled nearsource rather than outsource production and bring it closer to demand  indias volatile relationship with foreign direct investment fdi and uneven regulation is also something that continues to bother global companies  from prohibiting ecommerce companies to sell nonessential items and tweaking fdi rules to disallow easier capital flows from neighbouring countries the fear is that india has used the pandemic to build protectionist walls around itself  in a recent address to the nation indian prime minister narendra modi made be vocal for local his rallying cry new stimulus proposals meanwhile have increased thresholds for foreign companies bidding for indian contracts  the more that india can improve regulatory stability the better its chances of persuading more global businesses to establish hubs in india says mr biswal  so then who if not india  as things stand vietnam bangladesh south korea and taiwan seem to be favourites to benefit from the backlash against china the latter two at the hightech end of the spectrum and vietnam and bangladesh at the lower end according to mr jacob  image copyright getty images image caption president trump has blamed china for not doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus  multinationals began moving production out of china into these countries nearly a decade ago due to rising labour and environmental costs the slow exodus has only gathered pace as uschina trade tensions have increased in recent years  since june 2018 a month before the trade war began us goods imports from vietnam have soared by more than 50 and those from taiwan by 30 according to calculations made by the south china morning post newspaper  india is seen to have lost out because it failed to create conditions allowing multinationals to supply not only the local market but also to use the country as a production base to export to the world  in recent weeks several states have begun making moves to address some concerns around the ease of doing business  prime among them being making contentious changes to indias archaic labour laws put in place to reduce exploitation  uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh states for instance have suspended significant labour protections exempting factories from even maintaining basic requirements like cleanliness ventilation lighting and toilets  image copyright getty images image caption some indian states have stripped away laws that gave labourers basic protections  the intention is to improve the investment climate and attract global capital  but such decisions could become counterproductive and hurt rather than help says mr jacob international companies would be very wary about this they have strict codes of conduct on labour environment and safety standards for suppliers  the 2013 collapse of the rana plaza garment factory in bangladesh that supplied retailers like walmart was a turning point it forced bangladesh to significantly improve factory infrastructure and safety to clinch more investment he cautions  india has to follow better standards these are white board ideas drafted on powerpoint by bureaucrats who are completely divorced from the reality of global trade  but with the us weighing punitive action against china japan paying its corporations to move out of the country and uk lawmakers coming under pressure to reconsider their decision to allow chinese telecoms giant huawei a role in building the countrys new 5g data network global antichina sentiment is increasing  the time is ripe say experts for india to undertake broadbased structural reforms and use these sweeping geopolitical shifts to modify its trading relationship with the world

380,coronavirus security flaws found in nhs contacttracing app,image copyright getty images  wideranging security flaws have been flagged in the covid19 contacttracing app being piloted in the isle of wight  the security researchers involved have warned the problems pose risks to users privacy and could be abused to prevent contagion alerts being sent  gchqs national cyber security centre ncsc told the bbc it was already aware of most of the issues raised and is in the process of addressing them  but the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required  specifically they call for new legal protections to prevent officials using the data for purposes other than identifying those at risk of being infected or holding on to it indefinitely  in addition they suggest the nhs considers shifting from its current centralised model  where contactmatching happens on a computer server  to a decentralised version  where the matching instead happens on peoples phones  there can still be bugs and security vulnerabilities in either the decentralised or the centralised models said thinking cybersecurity chief executive dr vanessa teague  but the big difference is that a decentralised solution wouldnt have a central server with the recent facetoface contacts of every infected person  so theres a much lower risk of that database being leaked or abused  health secretary matt hancock said on monday a new law is not needed because the data protection act will do the job  and nhsx  the health services digital innovation unit  has said using the centralised model will both make it easier to improve the app over time and trigger alerts based on peoples selfdiagnosed symptoms rather than just medical test results  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption watch what is contact tracing and how does it work  varied risks  the researchers detail seven different problems they found with the app  they include  weaknesses in the registration process that could allow attackers to steal encryption keys which would allow them to prevent users being notified if a contact tested positive for covid19 andor generate spoof transmissions to create logs of bogus contact events  storing unencrypted data on handsets that could potentially be used by law enforcement agencies to determine when two or more people met  generating a new random id code for users once a day rather than once every 15 minutes as is the case in a rival model developed by google and apple the longer gap theoretically makes it possible to determine if a user is having an affair with a work colleague or meeting someone after work it is suggested  the risks overall are varied dr chris culnane the second author of the report told bbc news  in terms of the registration issues its fairly low risk because it would require an attack against a well protected server which we dont think is particularly likely  but the risk about the unencrypted data is higher because if someone was to get access to your phone then they might be able to learn some additional information because of what is stored on that  ncsc technical director ian levy blogged thanking the two researchers for their work and promising to address the issues they identified  but he said it might take several releases of the app before all the problems were addressed  everything reported to the team will be properly triaged although this is taking longer than normal he wrote  an ncsc spokesman said it was always hoped that measures such as releasing the code and explaining decisions behind the app would generate meaningful discussion with the security and privacy community  we look forward to continuing to work with security and cryptography researchers to make the app the best it can be  image copyright getty images image caption isle of wight residents are testing the nhs covid19 app ahead of a planned national rollout  but dr culnane said politicians also needed to revisit the issue  i have confidence that they will fix the technical issues he said  but there are broader issues around the lack of legislation protecting use of this data including the fact theres no strict limit on when the data has to be deleted  thats in contrast to australia which has very strict limits about deleting its app data at the end of the crisis  meanwhile harriet harman who chairs the parliaments human rights committee announced she was seeking permission to introduce a private members bill to limit who could use data gathered by the app and how and create a watchdog to deal with related complaints from the public  i personally would download the app myself even if im apprehensive about what the data would be used for the labour mp told bbc news  but the view of my committee was that this app should not go ahead unless the government is willing to put in place the privacy protections

the news she had been expecting for some time  she would need a lung transplant  the 31yearold was born with cystic fibrosis a lifeshortening genetic condition that can cause fatal lung damage in 2016 she became more breathless and her condition worsened leading to her taking the tests to go on the transplant list  since learning she would need a transplant ms beattie has spent time preparing for the procedure with an nhs transplant team of experts and psychologists  i was probably in denial i try my best at everything i was just feeling upset with myself and i was scared id never had a proper operation before  you work towards it you have every test imaginable so they can match up the organ with you and its just about keeping busy and focused and trying to see the best in myself  and there are mixed emotions which can depend on how you feel each day  one distraction is her online fashion business which came about because she had struggled to find dresses to fit because her rib cage is slightly larger due to her condition  her sister rachel then 14 came up with the idea to so start their own brand and a decade on they work with teams in manchester italy and portugal  ms beattie said its about determination and never giving up i work hard with my treatment and keep myself stable and with the business its the same  its about never giving up its about coping with setbacks and knowing you can get through  ms beattie from manchester hopes the law change will improve her chance of finding a match but acknowledged that her survival relies on someone losing a loved one  organs come from someone who has died and talking about that side of it is scary but i think the more organ donation is spoken about the more its an open conversation  she saved a life  image copyright keith

as both heartwarming and bittersweet from the recipient of her lungs  a motherofthree whose life was saved by the transplant  both families exchanged letters in a process that brought comfort said mr astbury who is now an nhs organ donation ambassador  he described his daughter who would have turned 43 today as a mother who lived for her son and a peoples person who cared about everything  so much so she had decided to retrain as a social worker  pippas organs didnt go to waste mr astbury said she saved a life and we feel part of pippa is still living and still with us

facing pressure from councils and teaching unions to reconsider plans to reopen english primary schools to some pupils from 1 june  at least 11 councils have expressed concerns over safety and timing  teaching union nasuwt said it remained unconvinced reopening schools was appropriate or practicable  justice secretary robert buckland said no 10 was taking all concerns very seriously  he told bbc breakfast that 1 june was an important date for everyone to work towards but he said the government accepted there may be issues from employers that need to be addressed which might not mean that well see a uniform approach  for most pupils schools have been closed since 20 march  from 1 june children in reception year 1 and year 6 in england will be able to return to school if infection rates and the governments other tests at the time allow it england is the only uk nation to set a return date so far  schools in wales will not reopen on 1 june while those in scotland and northern ireland may

safety concerns but have not urged all their schools to reject the proposed timeframe  academies have the freedom to make their own decision unlike the two thirds of primary schools supported by local authorities  emma knights the chief executive of the national governance association which advises school governors told the bbc it would be hard for governors to ignore the position of their local authorities  she said as councils might be legally judged the employers of school staff governors would need a very strong reason to make a different decision  the decision to begin reopening schools came after the reproduction or r number  the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to on average  came down across every part of the uk  but multiple research groups including those at the university of cambridge show it varies across the country  it has come down most in london but is higher in the northeast of england  metro mayors in the northwest of england

a more cautious approach to the relaxation of the lockdown rules  meanwhile a survey of 29000 members of the teachers union nasuwt found just one in 20 thought it would be safe for more pupils to return next month  patrick roach the unions general secretary said the government had thus far failed to win the trust and confidence of teachers about the safety of reopening schools  he called for all the scientific evidence from the governments scientific advisory group for emergencies sage to be made available to teachers and schools as soon as possible  on tuesday deputy chief scientific adviser prof dame angela mclean told the no 10 briefing that an effective system for tracing new coronavirus cases needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed  asked whether this system will be in place by 1 june the justice secretary said he hoped it would but it wont necessarily be as widespread and as fullblown as we would like  acceptable level of risk  the doctors union the british medical association said schools should reopen as soon as it is safe to do so but warned a zerorisk approach is not possible  this is about safe being an acceptable level of risk the bmas dr peter english wrote in the daily telegraph  last week the bma said covid19 infection rates were too high for englands schools to reopen  attendance by primary school pupils will be voluntary and schools are reporting varied levels of interest from the parents  secondary schools are likely to stay closed until september but the government hopes those facing exams next year  years 10 and 12  will get some time in school before the summer holidays  image copyright getty images  a department for education spokeswoman said we want children back in schools as soon as possible because being

continues  however the idea of having fewer restrictions in place for travel between countries with low levels of coronavirus has been suggested  can i go on a foreign holiday  at the moment its unlikely  british nationals are being urged not to take any nonessential foreign travel and to return home from abroad if possible  various countries like the us have travel restrictions which prevent or limit foreign arrivals and many airlines are offering a reduced service or have suspended all flights  whats more the uk is planning to introduce a 14day quarantine period as soon as possible visitors and uk nationals returning home will have to selfisolate for two weeks upon arrival although people coming from ireland will be exempt  whats the chance that this will change  transport secretary grant shapps has told mps that the quarantine arrangements  expected to come into force in early june  would be a blanket solution at first  but he suggested that air bridges could be introduced this would be an arrangement where travellers from countries with low coronavirus levels could be exempt from quarantine  speaking to the bbc greeces tourism minister called for his country  which has not been badly affected  to be among those exempt from quarantine rules  can i go on holiday in the uk  people in england are free to drive any distance to other destinations in england like parks and beaches but are not supposed to stay overnight away from home including any second property they own  selfcatering cottages airbnb properties and uk campsites hotels and holiday parks will remain shut until at least the beginning of july  image copyright getty images image caption tourists are being asked to stay away from beauty spots like the lake district  many national parks

cannot travel for recreation into wales scotland or northern ireland  should i book a summer holiday  it is just not possible to say at this stage  hotels and holiday resorts in england may start to reopen at the beginning of july if the government considers enough progress has been made against its five tests  restrictions may also ease across the rest of the uk allowing people to travel more widely at home  image copyright getty images image caption it is possible english and scottish households maybe able to visit wales by the summer and vice versa  ryanair and british airways plan to ramp up their flights in july and easyjet hopes it will join them  all tui and first choice holidays are cancelled until at least 11 june  what are other countries doing  the eu has insisted there will be a summer season this year  the european commission has proposed a gradual lifting of travel restrictions throughout the eu  seasonal workers and citizens of countries with similar levels of infections could start to travel more freely first  the commission recommends people follow social distancing rules and use mandatory face masks while travelling and that there is controlled access to hotel and restaurant facilities in resorts  image copyright getty images image caption mallorca and the other balearic islands are heavily reliant on tourism  there would have to be enough hospital capacity to deal with any spike in cases and it is clear that if infections start to rise again restrictions may be reimposed  the plans are nonbinding so it will be up to individual countries to implement changes and its not yet clear what it might mean for uk travellers  what about going away in the autumn  again it is impossible at this stage to say if it will be possible  travel advice will need to have been updated but it depends on the diseases progress  image copyright getty images image caption easyjets planes are currently all grounded  holidays and flights booked against foreign office travel advice are unlikely to be covered by travel insurance if you are not able to travel after all  what about holidays already booked for this year  if your package holiday or flights have already been cancelled then you are are entitled to a full cash refund  however lots of people are struggling to get their money back and being offered vouchers or rebooked trips instead  if you are offered a voucher or a free rebooking instead of cash you can accept or refuse it but if the airline later folds the voucher may no longer be valid  if your airline or holiday company hasnt cancelled your holiday yet but you no longer wish to travel you may not be entitled to a refund  however some providers are allowing people to rebook trips for a later date at no cost

isolation  a diary written by an awardwinning chinese author documenting her life in wuhan in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak has now been translated into english  fang fang first began publishing online accounts of her experience in the city in january while it was still believed to be a local crisis  the 65yearolds diary entries were widely read providing millions in china with a rare glimpse into the city where the virus first emerged  earlier this year wuhan became the first place in the world to enter a state of complete lockdown that was then unheard of but has now become widespread the city was essentially cut off from not only china but the rest of the world  as the lockdown continued fang fangs popularity grew publishers then announced that they would collate her entries and publish them in several languages  but fang fangs growing international recognition has come with a shift in the way she is viewed in china  with many angered by her reporting even branding her a traitor  what was her diary about  in late january after china imposed a lockdown in wuhan fang fang  whose real name is wang fang  began documenting events in the city on chinese social media site weibo  in her diary entries she wrote about everything from the challenges of daily life to the physiological impact of forced isolation  publisher harpercollins says she gave voice to the fears frustrations anger and hope of millions of her fellow citizens  it notes she also speaks out against social injustice abuse of power and other problems which impeded the response to the epidemic and gets herself embroiled in online controversies because of it  in one column written by her published by the sunday times she details an instance where she went to pick her daughter up from the airport  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption learn how wuhan dealt with the lockdown  there were hardly any cars or pedestrians on the streets those few days were when panic and fright were at their height in the city we both wore facemasks she said  how did it come to international attention  during a time where news was being heavily filtered and independent news outlets were scarce fang fang quickly emerged as a reliable source of information boosted no doubt by her background as a wellknown writer  this country needs writers with a conscience like you the public has lost trust with much of the official media one user on weibo had reportedly said according to news site the independent  her reputation as well as her words quickly spread and it wasnt long before it found its way out of china  why did china turn on her  cybernationalism is common on chinese social media thousands of angry netizens stand ready to rear their head whenever china is criticised humiliated or subjected to some form of foreign insult and fang fang is far from the first chinese writer to face online backlash  in this case as the virus continued to spread across the world people started to become more critical of chinas response to the outbreak the heavy scrutiny and criticism meant many went on the defensive  it was in this climate that it became known that fang fangs works were due to be sold in the west  image copyright afp image caption wuhan has begun to return to normal after weeks of a strict lockdown  according to specialist news site whats on weibo this was when public opinion turned against it after it became known that an international edition of her diary was on presale through amazon  in the eyes of many chinese users a translated version of fangs critical account of the wuhan outbreak would only provide opponents of china with more ammunition says the report  she was quickly seen not as a bearer of truth but instead a traitor to china with some saying she was capitalising on her fame  and even possibly a tragedy  shes seizing this time of national crisis and taking advantage of it said one user on weibo this is contemptible  image copyright afp image caption authorities in wuhan are carrying out rigorous testing for further infections of the coronavirus  the anger against her is not helped by the fact that the book was published by us publisher harpercollins  at a time when the us and china are in the midst of a diplomatic spat  chinese state media have also made it very clear what their position is on fang fang  her global rise propelled by foreign media outlets has sounded the alarm for many in china that the writer might have become just another handy tool for the west to sabotage chinese peoples efforts said a piece by the global times  her diary only exposes the dark side in wuhan while ignoring the efforts that local people made and the support extended across the nation  how has her book been received  its hard to say as the book was only made available last friday  the new york times has praised its raw honesty saying she may live meekly during the lockdown but she writes bold sentences  a review by npr says the diary is a document of the trivial tragic and absurd during wuhans 76 days of lockdown but laments that the translation into english is unable to capture a multidimensionality found in her chinese diaries  on amazon however the book has been met with a handful of negative reviews one of which called the book totally fake information  another reviewer however praised the book saying her diary provided a window into what it was like to live in a city that the whole world was watching

424,trump is taking hydroxychloroquine white house confirms,donald trump on tuesday further touted his apparent taking of the antimalaria drug hydroxychloroquine as protection against coronavirus despite federal regulators warning of the potentially serious even fatal dangers  as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the us continued to rise and the death toll crept inexorably towards a landmark 100000 the highest in the world trump spent public appearances repeatedly talking about a dubious treatment and an economic comeback  the president claimed a recent united states study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a “trump enemy statement”  “if you look at the one survey the only bad survey they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape” trump said “they were very old almost dead it was a trump enemy statement”  there have only been limited studies on the drug in relation to covid19 so far  hydroxychloroquine trump and covid19 what you need to know read more  a spokeswoman for the president confirmed he is taking the malaria drug as a defense against covid19  the confirmation came hours after the house speaker nancy pelosi expressed alarm that trump was taking the drug since he is “morbidly obese” in her words  at the white house the press secretary kayleigh mcenany told cbs news trump was taking hydroxychloroquine  “i can absolutely confirm that” she said  “the president said himself he’s taking it that’s a given fact he said it the president should be taken at his word”  the story behind trumps miracle drug hydroxychloroquine – podcast read more  trump told reporters at the white house on monday that for “a couple weeks” he had been taking hydroxychloroquine which he first touted as a covid19 treatment in march before the food and drug administration fda warned that the drug could cause irregular heartbeats and other cardiac trouble  the fda has approved the drug for the treatment of malaria lupus and rheumatoid arthritis  “you’d be surprised at how many people are taking it … the frontline workers many many are taking it” trump said on monday  on tuesday mcenany told fox news “any use of hydroxychloroquine has to be in consultation with your doctor you have to have a prescription that’s the way it must be done”  the white house on monday issued a statement by sean p conley trump’s doctor which concluded “after numerous discussions he and i had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relevant risks”  trump then falsely claimed that evidence suggests hydroxychloroquine does not have negative side effects “what has been determined is it doesn’t harm you” trump said  in reality the food and drug administration has said hydroxychloroquine should only be used as a coronavirus treatment in hopsital settings due to “reports of serious heart rhythm problems” in virus patients who had received the drug  when a reporter mentioned the fda guidance trump said “that’s not what i was told”  but pelosi has expressed alarm  “he’s our president and i would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists especially in his age group and his shall we say weight group” the house speaker 80 told cnn of trump 73 on monday evening  “morbidly obese they say so i think it’s not a good idea”  trump is obese as the federal centers for disease control and prevention cdc defines the term but he does not appear to qualify as “extremely obese” the top category the ambiguity stems from unreliable data as trump tends to exaggerate his height and lowball his weight  the fda advised in april that hydroxycholoroquine and chloroquine “have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing covid19”  “while clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for covid19 there are known sideeffects of these medications that should be considered” the fda commissioner stephen hahn said in a statement then  the fda has not updated that guidance experts warned that trump’s claim to be taking the drug could lead to a spike in demand potentially making it harder for vulnerable patients who need the drug to fill prescriptions  after trump hyped the drug in march an arizona man died from ingesting a form of chloroquine used to clean fish tanks  “we saw trump on tv – every channel – and all of his buddies said that this was safe” the man’s wife who also ingested the drug told nbc “trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure”  on monday night a fox news host neil cavuto expressed his concern telling viewers “i only make this not to make a political point here but a lifeanddeath point be very very careful”  fox news opinion hosts laura ingraham tucker carlson and sean hannity swung behind the president but trump was angered nonetheless retweeting one twitter user who called cavuto an “asshole” he also bemoaned the network’s output since the departure of roger ailes who resigned as chairman and ceo in disgrace after being credibly accused of sexual harassment ailes died in 2017  hydroxychloroquine trump and covid19 what you need to know read more  last month trump who has refused to wear a mask as a basic prophylactic measure against the virus’s spread riffed from the white house podium that “powerful light” and “disinfectant” could be potential covid19 treatments prompting warnings from manufacturers of some cleaning products  those comments coincided with a spike in calls to poison control centers and prompted us disinfectant manufacturers to issue warnings that their products should not be ingested

430,new york gears up for contact tracing but experts warn of difficulties,both city and state aim to recruit thousands to trace contacts of those diagnosed with coronavirus as part of plans to reopen  new york faces enormous challenges in its attempts to implement one of the largest contact tracing schemes in the us as the city prepares to reopen after nearly two months of coronavirus lockdown  the new york governor andrew cuomo has said the state is recruiting an “army of people to trace each person who tested positive” for an “unprecedented nationleading contact tracing programme” the new york city mayor bill de blasio announced a new test and trace corps which he said would “lead the way in creating testing and tracing on a level we’ve never seen before in this city or this country”  contact tracing is considered to be a key pillar of safely lifting stayathome orders and involves asking covid19 patients to recall everyone they have had close contact with while they may have been infectious and asking those people to quarantine themselves to help prevent the virus from spreading in countries such as south korea and germany early contact tracing has been credited with successfully minimising outbreaks  but as new york authorities roll out their plans to hire and train thousands of contact tracers experts warn of the difficulties of pulling it off in thecity of 86 million in which the pandemic that has killed more than 20000 people  and de blasio who is hiring his own team of 5000 contact tracers – separate from the 6400 to 17000 being recruited by new york state – is facing mounting questions over its organisation  dr tom frieden former director of the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and former commissioner of the new york city health department said “there are enormous challenges in new york city – ranging from the extent of the outbreak here which is still very large to the mobility of population in metro areas  “this is the biggest health emergency in more than a century and new york city has had a heartbreaking number of deaths” he added  frieden who is now president and ceo of resolve to save lives which is working on the state’s contact tracing effort said other challenges include population density reliance on public transport and the amount of travel into the city  “all the things that we love about new york city … make it more susceptible and more challenging to do contact tracing”  large crowded housing including in nursing homes correctional facilities and homeless shelters is also an issue he said  new york state said contact tracing was already under way while new york city said it plans to have hired 1000 tracers by 1 june neither city nor state have said how much their programmes will cost other us states developing tracing programmes include neighbouring new jersey and connecticut as well as massachusetts and california  new york city said although previous experience in public health is preferred for tracers new recruits will be supported and trained by experienced “disease detectives” tracers they said will do most of their work on the phone  frieden said contact tracing is “not an easy job” and requires an understanding of patient confidentiality medical terms principles of exposure infection and symptoms as well as interpersonal skills and cultural sensitivity  the mayor has come under fire for putting nyc health  hospitals hh the city’s public healthcare system in charge of contact tracing rather than the department of health and mental hygiene dohmh which has historically done it – including for diseases like tuberculosis and hiv  a group of new york politicians including senator gustavo rivera have called on de blasio to reverse the decision such was the concern that the city council speaker corey johnson who said the plan “raises a lot of alarm bells” held a hearing on friday to investigate  frieden said the move was “a big mistake” adding “moving it to an agency that has no experience with it no legal mandate to do it no institutional memory of how to do it will make something that’s very difficult even harder”  avery cohen a spokeswoman for the mayor said it was done to “prioritise continuity speed and the ability to break down bureaucratic barriers” by “housing testing tracing and isolation under a single streamlined entity”  facebook twitter pinterest a contact tracer with turkey’s health ministry clad in protective gear visits a home in istanbul it is expected that new york’s contact tracers will do most of their work on the phone photograph emrah gürelap  new york state which is working with the former new york mayor and businessman michael bloomberg and johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health has specified that every region must have at least 30 tracers for every 100000 residents in order to reopen  it said all tracer applicants will take an online introductory covid19 contact tracing course devised by johns hopkins university and available free on coursera for which they will have to score at least 85  the contact tracing process will begin in labs which will report covid19 cases to contact tracers who will then interview the positive patient to identify everyone they may have had contact with over the past two weeks the tracer notifies and interviews each contact tells them to quarantine for two weeks and monitors them by text to see if they are showing symptoms  dr kelly henning who leads bloomberg philanthropies’ public health programme which is assisting in the hiring process said the initial interview with the person who has tested positive is key  “we recognise that it won’t be 100 effective but the goal is to get as many contacts identified and pulled into the system as quickly as possible to break those chains of transmission”  and if people refuse to cooperate henning said with a good rapport ongoing contact and education she has found “compliance is very high”  dr sungil cho a professor of epidemiology at seoul national university who is on the consultation committees of korea centres for disease control and prevention and seoul city’s coronavirus responses said “in the korean legal system the police give great help tracking credit card usage transportation paths mobile communication signals and cctv analysis just as any criminal investigation”  but in the us digital tracing technology such as the initiative by apple and google has prompted data privacy fears on thursday five democrats introduced a bill to protect the health data of consumers using contact tracing technology  katharina kopp deputy director of the center for digital democracy said “history has taught us that the deployment of technologies is often driven by forces that tend to risk privacy undermine fairness and equity and place our civil rights at risk”  facebook twitter pinterest a woman displays her phone to doorman to confirm using a mobile application to help contacttracing at the entrance to the upmarket shopping mall siam paragon in bangkok thailand on sunday photograph gemunu amarasingheap  at friday’s hearing dr mitch katz president and chief executive officer of health  hospitals said they are working on an app but that “we are absolutely committed that none of the data that is collected will be shared” when asked about quarantine enforcement he said “we believe that carrots are much better than sticks”  bloomberg has said the public health nonprofit vital strategies funded by bloomberg philanthropies is developing three smartphone apps for new york state but henning said initially the focus would be on using human contact tracers and that all information would be kept “fully private”  she said “the idea of using humans is the tried and true public health strategy so we have confidence that that will be a successful model – assuming we have the right number of contact tracers and they’re welltrained and wellsupervised”  amid record unemployment there has been no shortage of applications new york city said it had had more than 10000 people apply and the state has had over 30000  the online course which takes five hours to

431,hydroxychloroquine trump and covid19 what you need to know,as the us president reports he is taking antimalarial drug what are the risks and research  donald trump has reignited a controversy over the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine after telling reporters he was taking the latter to protect himself against coronavirus what do we know about these drugs  what is hydroxychloroquine  hydroxychloroquine which trump says he has been taking for about two weeks was developed as an antimalarial but it is also used to treat conditions like lupus an antiimmune disease and arthritis where it can help combat inflammation it has been licensed for use in the us since the mid 1950s and is listed by the world health organization as an “essential” medicine  what is the link to covid19  researchers have been interested in chloroquines as an antiviral agent for some time a study in virology journal in 2005 found that chloroquine inhibited the closely related sars virus in primate cells in lab conditions  however evidence for the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in recent human trials during the coronavirus pandemic has been at best inconclusive with some suggestions that it could worsen the outcome of severe cases  the who is looking at whether hydroxychloroquine could be an effective covid19 treatment while the us national institutes for health is also running a clinical trial to establish whether the drug administered together with the antibiotic azithromycin can prevent hospitalisation and death from covid19  in recent days enthusiasm about hydroxychloroquine has been boosted by a study which has yet to be peerreviewed that looked at the combination of hydroxychloroquine the antibiotic azithromycin and zinc supplements  it showed that patients who received the threedrug combination vs the twodrug combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were 44 less likely to die than the second group joseph rahimian a coauthor of the study pointed out that the study’s findings were limited to the possible promise of zinc not of hydroxychloroquine  the story behind trumps miracle drug hydroxychloroquine – podcast read more  what’s the state of the current evidence  in may the british medical journal reported on a randomised although still problematic clinical trial in china that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked with serious adverse events noted in two patients  a second study reported in the bmj last week on a french trial also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to covid19 overall 89 of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days compared with 91 in the control group  the us food and drug administration in a safety alert issued on 24 april warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious sideeffects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial  what are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine  there are a number of sideeffects the most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart other sideeffects include headache dizziness nausea vomiting stomach pain skin rash or itching or hair loss research published by the mayo clinic has suggested that “offlabel” repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to “druginduced sudden cardiac death”  although trump’s official physician has said he was in “very good health” at his last official checkup the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a bmi category of “clinically obese”  so why is trump taking it  despite there being no conclusive body of evidence that it can be effective when used to prevent contracting coronavirus the president apparently decided in conversation with the white house physician sean p conley that it was worth the risks  “after numerous discussions he and i had for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks” conley wrote  it is probably worth pointing out that conley a naval doctor trained initially as an osteopath and then in emergency medicine serving as research director at portsmouth navy department of emergency medicine prior to his assignment to the white house medical unit  for his part trump despite the fda and other warnings said “i think it’s good i’ve heard a lot of good stories and if it’s not good i’ll tell you right i’m not going to get hurt by it it’s been around for 40 years”  have we been here before  yes trump has a history of personally advocating for the use hydroxychloroquine which he has described as a potential “gamechanger” although it has been reported that trump has a small stake in a french company that makes hydroxychloroquine via an investment fund this seems to be about trump’s own hunches and his desire to be both proved right and protected against the disease  on monday he also claimed lots of doctors were using the drug prophylactically and cited letters he had received from members of the public as paul waldman a columnist in the washington post has suggested this is more about trump’s psychology than anything else  “trump compensates for his own insecurity by working to convince himself and everyone else that the experts don’t know what they’re talking about and he knows more than them about everything” waldman has written
432,no one had any idea contact tracers lack knowledge about covid19 job,they were hailed as stepping up to serve their country with all the “rigorous” and “detailed” instruction needed for such an important role – but a programme to train thousands of contacttracers to help control the spread of coronavirus has been described as shambolic and inadequate by recruits  people hired to contact those exposed to someone with covid19 and advise them to selfisolate have reported spending days just trying to log into the online system and virtual training sessions that left participants unclear about their roles  new contact tracers have been told to rely on a twopage script and a list of frequently asked questions both seen by the guardian when one taking part in a training session run by contact centre company sitel asked for guidance on how to speak with somebody whose loved one had died of coronavirus they were reportedly told to look at youtube videos on the topic  matt hancock the health secretary said on monday that 21000 contact tracers had been recruited across england surpassing the initial target of 18000 “they have rigorous training with detailed procedure designed by our experts at public health england” he said “they have stepped up to serve their country in their hour of need”  hancock claimed the government now had “the elements we need to roll out our national test and trace service the testing capacity the tracing capability and the technology”  but one man who asked to remain anonymous told the guardian he had spent three days getting paid but receiving very little information or training  he said he had applied for a job as a “work at home – customer service adviser” for £10 an hour which was advertised on the job website indeed he got an email checking he had the right software and then received a call to tell him what the job entailed and ask when he could start  he took part in a day of online training run by sitel on sunday logging on to a remote system where there was one trainer for about 100 other people “we had a chat box where we could ask him questions but the first hour and a half of the training was just people writing ‘i can’t hear anything’”  “the trainer said the problems were normal and he’d been taking the sessions since last wednesday” said the man “he was just being slammed with questions all the way through he was saying ‘guys i can’t answer all your questions there are too many of you’ he said at one point ‘does anybody know what this job is about’ no one really had any idea”  the people in the training were told they would be acting as agents in the contacttracing team working on behalf of phe “you will be acting as the first point of contact with the contacts of confirmed positive cases of covid19” they were told in a slide presentation seen by the guardian  they were told they would be calling up confirmed contacts of positive coronavirus cases recording their data and escalating “more challenging cases” – including people who refused to cooperate – to more senior call handlers  “after the full day of training people were still asking the most basic things someone also asked what they should do if they spoke to someone whose relative had died of the virus and he said we should look on youtube where there are lots of videos about empathy and sympathy when talking to someone” said the man  “then i looked at the rota and it said i was starting the next morning at 9am” he said he logged in first thing and received a message saying “sit tight and wait for us to instruct you” he did nothing all day but got an email assuring him he would still get paid and was told that he would be doing more training soon  one woman told the guardian she had been recruited to be a contact tracer and had spent three days trying and failing to log into the sitel system “matt hancock was saying last night that it was all ready to go” she said “it’s not”  responding to the complaints about contacttracing training a spokesperson for the department of health and social care – also speaking on behalf of sitel – said that recruits were being trained ahead of the rollout so were not yet expected to make calls  they said that all applicants were interviewed through a combination of online assessments and telephone screening and had to provide disclosure and barring service dbs and right to work information they added that a suggestion to use youtube for advice on how to deal with a bereaved person would be investigated and was not in line with their training  “staff are trained on data security customer service safeguarding vulnerable children and adults operating procedures and when to escalate issues among other matters” they said “only applicants that have passed the training modules and technical tests are allowed to move onto the next stage and start work”  the testimony from contact tracers is the latest sign of problems with the government’s attempt to establish an efficient track trace and isolate system to allow the country to return to something close to normal life  on sunday ministers were accused by labour of “misstep after misstep” after contact tracing applicants were told recruitment was on hold while the government considered an alternative app  emails sent by one of the privatesector companies handling the recruitment process kentbased hr go said “unfortunately earlier today the roles were put on hold this is due to a delay in the launch of the ‘track and trace’ app itself while the government considers an alternative app”  dhsc said the email was “wrong and could cause confusion” though a government spokesperson confirmed the next day that the rollout of the app would not take place by the middle of may as initially promised
433,uk plans for contacttracing in doubt as app not ready until june,plans to introduce coronavirus tracing have been hit by fresh uncertainty as it emerged that a mobile tracking app will not be ready until june  matt hancock the health secretary said last week that the app would be “rolling out in mid may” across england but on tuesday ministerial sources tried to downplay a system considered critical to control the disease as the country emerges from lockdown  play video 555 how covid19 contact tracing can help beat the pandemic  it came as the deputy chief scientific adviser acknowledged the decision to abandon trackandtrace in march was made because of a lack of testing capacity but said it was “the right thing to do” in the circumstances  prof angela mclean told the no 10 press briefing “the advice that we gave certainly took account of what testing was available it was what was the best thing to do with the tests that we had we could not have people in hospital with covid symptoms not knowing whether or not they had covid”  answering another question she added “at the time with the testing we had the right thing to do was focus it on people who were really sick in hospital so we knew who in hospital had covid”  george eustice the environment secretary appeared to back up her view saying “it’s undoubtedly the case that early on we were wanting to build that capacity”  nhs insiders said the deployment of the tracking app currently being trialled on the isle of wight would not take place until next month as developers iron out problems “this is a complicated thing to do and get right” one source said  it is the latest in a string of slippages that have followed hancock’s declaration by the end of last week the launch date moved back to the end of the month and on monday downing street said it would be ready “in a few weeks”  efforts have been further complicated by the government’s insistence on deploying a centralised tracing database which records a user’s contacts and the first half of their postcode if they declare they are ill  the nhs says it wants to be able to monitor for regional outbreaks but that approach is not favoured by tech giants apple and google – who say contact data should be retained only by a person on their phone  that has forced the nhs development team to develop a string of “workarounds” to try to make the system run smoothly a particular concern has been to ensure that the phone remains on – so the app can track connections – whilst not draining the battery  signs of the growing difficulties were acknowledged by thérèse coffey the work and pensions secretary on tuesday morning she conceded that children may start returning to primary school on 1 june before the app was ready “i’m not aware that’s been set as a condition that’s necessary for the phased reopening of primary schools” she said  a government source added that the app should be seen as “a support a digital supplement” to human contacttracing – and downplayed the significance of the new technology insisting “there’s been a bit too much focus on the app”  privacy watchdogs also warned on tuesday that the tracing app could hand a huge amount of personal information to the government  martha spurrier the director of liberty said “given the government’s record of sharing health education and police records with immigration enforcement it’s alarming that it has chosen an app design that prioritises data collection – including data not needed for contacttracing – over privacy”  labour mp harriet harman the chair of parliament’s joint committee on human rights called for mps to be allowed to vote on preventing government from using the data collected for other purposes – although hancock has insisted fresh legislation is not required to get started
434,heed lessons of 2008 crisis experts warn global leaders,global leaders must heed the lessons of the financial crisis of 2008 when they look to repair the damage from the coronavirus pandemic leading experts have warned to avoid entrenching disastrous social health and environmental inequalities and hastening climate breakdown  the 2008 global financial crisis and recession marked the last time the world experienced a convulsion comparable in scale to the coronavirus crisis though starkly different in its nature governments responded first with economic rescue and stimulus packages worth trillions in taxpayer cash followed in many cases by austerity programmes to cut back public spending  but the past decade has produced far greater levels of inequality than has been seen since before the second world war producing starker contrasts between the extremely rich and the rest in health job security education and other measures with poorer people suffering worst and the middle classes squeezed while the income of the top 1 soared  greenhouse gas emissions have also risen despite warnings from scientists and the paris agreement of 2015 threatening an even worse crisis if governments do not rapidly change tack the rise came despite some efforts to “green” the post financial crisis recovery with lowcarbon and environmental measures accounting for about 16 of the stimulus  to avoid a similar outcome this time leaders must ensure their response to the covid19 crisis looks to the good of the whole of society rather than just the economy and addresses the climate emergency as well said sir michael marmot who led the landmark uk review of public health that found life expectancy fell following austerity  “the scale of what is happening in the economy now is hugely greater than in 2008” he told the guardian “we need to bring the climate agenda and the health agenda together if we are not careful the steps we take now will increase inequalities further enough people are saying now that austerity is not an experiment we want to repeat”  marmot is one of the leading voices calling for a “green recovery” that would direct any economic stimulus towards measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as generating jobs and repairing the economy  the economic stimulus in the years after 2008 did produce some environmental improvements such as investments in renewable energy which have cut the cost of solar and wind power but the push to cut emissions was stymied by factors such as the sharp fall in the carbon price under the eu’s emissions trading scheme and china’s construction push  this time can be different argues lord nicholas stern one of the world’s leading climate economists and author of the landmark 2006 review of the costs of climate change “technology is completely different now we have seen the costs of key technologies such as renewable energy come right down we have altogether superior electric vehicle technology and we know more about air pollution and how many people it kills”  putting money into the fossil fuel economy would be a waste he added “that produces insecurity if we do things that leave stranded assets in fossil fuel businesses we also have stranded jobs”  yet talking about environmental measures in the midst of an economic crisis may not be popular and could be seized on by populist opponents of climate action the gilets jaunes protests in france were sparked by a rise in fuel taxes that had a particular impact on poorer workers in rural areas those protests had roots far deeper than just the fuel tax some extending back to the response to the 2008 financial crisis but some experts fear they show how green measures can be presented as contrary to working people’s interests  “the gilets jaunes show there is a lesson to learn” says fatih birol executive director of the international energy agency and one of the most influential global voices on energy economics “i am afraid there will be a divergence among policymakers – they will see a choice between either jobs or climate change it’s very important that we put policies in place that help to create jobs and stimulate a clean energy transition”  leading economists are hopeful however that those mistakes can be avoided and that the world will turn to “build back better” instead of pouring resources into fossil fuels  “focus on what we already know works” said birol that means clean energy such as wind and solar power and energy efficiency “then focus on technologies that are ready for the big time – hydrogen energy and batteries third we need sustained political support”  the green recovery now has a rigorous intellectual underpinning in the form of a paper by nobelwinning economist joseph stiglitz stern and others published earlier this month the paper examined the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and found that putting public money into green projects produced greater returns in both the short and long term than pouring cash into conventional highcarbon projects  that is crucial according to brian o’callaghan of the smith school for enterprise at oxford university and coauthor of the study because governments want “shovelready” projects that produce a lot of jobs quickly that do not need too high levels of existing skills or extensive training and that provide infrastructure that benefit the economy  retrofitting buildings working on cities to make them more friendly to cyclists and pedestrians digging trenches for broadband connections putting in networks for charging electric vehicles and planting trees are all examples of “shovelready” projects that could create jobs in the short term and reduce emissions permanently according to stern “these are things that can be done quickly and they are labour intensive”  “policymakers have time to design policy that both accelerates our economic recovery and reduces inequality” said o’callaghan “it is time to rethink economic stimulus this spending should be about more than just increasing next year’s gdp onceinageneration government spending could be used to reduce inequality and set up new industries for the coming decade”

438,coronavirus affects mental health too – heres what we know  anthony david,no aspect of our bodies or our lives is immune to the coronavirus pandemic this is certainly the case for mental health with some experts issuing dire warnings about an impending psychological “tsunami” whether through having mental health problems or our extraordinary attempts to contain them  while it’s too early to know what the longterm mental health effects of covid19 may be we can seek lessons from the sars epidemic of 200204 and mers in 2012 both caused by a closely related virus the publication in the lancet psychiatry of the first comprehensive synthesis of evidence on the psychiatric consequences of coronavirus infection – encompassing sars mers and covid19 – offers us some early insight  this systematic review led by the doctor and phd student jonathan rogers of 72 published studies involving more than 3500 patients found that a quarter of people hospitalised for coronavirus infections including covid19 have some kind of confusion or delirium this is most likely due to reduced oxygen reaching the brain or the effects of fever but could – in a few cases – reflect a more direct attack on the central nervous system neurologists are seeing rare cases of encephalitis most likely immune mediated  but what of common mental disorders around a third had depression or anxiety which tended to subside after the acute phase data from the postacute illness phase are more pertinent although based on sars and mers alone almost one in three cases in hospital went on to develop posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd that’s based on 402 people from four studies but followed up for nearly three years rates of depression and anxiety – which overlap with ptsd – were at roughly 15 one year after the illness and more than 15 also complained of fatigue mood swings and sleep disorders although the figures suggest large numbers of new psychiatric casualties these people had severe illnesses and any lifethreatening condition is likely to require some psychological readjustment  it isn’t all bad a few studies describe the phenomenon of posttraumatic growth – which i’ve seen firsthand colleagues who while pushed to their limit find they have never felt more vital or fulfilled  another longerterm outcome is suicide and some commentators have prophesied increased rates this is dangerous as even talking about suicide can weaken a troubled person’s resolve to resist taking their life and the effect can be contagious while there was a slight peak in suicides in older people during the sars epidemic in hong kong this might have reflected local cultural factors such as the stigma and shame some endured because they believed they were responsible for passing on the infection to loved ones of course isolation and fear will add to the despair of all vulnerable people caught up in the pandemic and strenuous efforts from mental health charities and community organisations to reach out and mitigate these effects have begun the 19thcentury sociologist emile durkheim surmised that social cohesion was a bulwark against suicide which explains the near universal fall in suicide rates in times of war  will the “we’re all in this together” effect pull us through the current phoney war possibly the bigger worry is that an aftermath of recession unemployment alcohol and indebtedness will be overwhelming for some  information from cases in hospital only gives us part of the picture but other emerging data from wellconducted population surveys can complete it for example the covid19 social survey led by social scientist daisy fancourt at ucl is publishing results week by week from a pool of around 100000 people this shows that levels of anxiety spiked around the lockdown but have since been gradually subsiding as we get more used to the situation mean levels of anxiety scored on standardised scales were well below the cutoff for even mild clinical disorder the survey does show that those already suffering from a mental disorder before the pandemic were made worse and for them it could be the difference between “just managing” and something else  there is revolution in the air now but history shows the old order will fight back  nesrine malik read more  for the half a million people with serious and enduring mental illnesses such as schizophrenia social isolation is the default if you live in a world where at best anything from religion to tv and the internet seem arranged to undermine your sense of self rather than offer a comfort or distraction imagine what it’s like to be in the midst of a pandemic one of my patients described how her nemesis the persecutory voice that followed her every thought announced that he was suffering from a virus “himself” eventually the voice that personification of threat fell victim to the disease my patient enjoyed a few days of blissful respite until – so she believed – the virus in a final posthumous categorydefying leap infected her too  if there’s a lesson from psychiatry at times like this it is to hang on to a kind of natural and shared immunity studies on “psychological debriefing” after traumatic events that is therapists carrying out assessment interviews immediately following a trauma show that not only does this not help it actually makes the situation worse sometimes increasing rates of ptsd perhaps such clinical efforts derail natural processes – biological psychological and social – that have evolved to deal with major adverse events of course some people will require more and competent clinicians need to be on hand to deploy all the treatments available but most especially those recovering or venturing out to work don’t need to be encouraged to emote in a certain way to list the pain and guilt most people will need a good night’s sleep personal protection reassurance that their efforts are appreciated or that they’ve come through the worst and above all the space to share stories with each other  • anthony david is director of the ucl institute of mental health and author of into the abyss a neuropsychiatrist’s notes

439,the uk government was ready for this pandemic until it sabotaged its own system,w  e are trapped in a long dark tunnel all of whose known exits are blocked there is no plausible route out of the uk’s coronavirus crisis that does not involve mass suffering and death if as some newspapers and conservative mps insist the government eases the lockdown while the pandemic is still raging the eventual death toll could be several times greater than today’s if it doesn’t and we spend all the warm months of the year in confinement the impact on our mental and physical health jobs and relationships could be catastrophic  we have been told repeatedly that the uk was unprepared for this pandemic this is untrue the uk was prepared but then it deprepared last year the global health security index ranked this nation second in the world for pandemic readiness while the us was first broadly speaking in both nations the necessary systems were in place our governments chose not to use them  the climate modeller james annan has used his analytical methods to show what would have happened if the uk government had imposed its lockdown a week earlier starting it on 16 march rather than 23 march his modelling suggests would by now have saved around 30000 lives reducing the rate of illness and death from coronavirus roughly by a factor of five  but even 16 march would have been extraordinarily late we now know that government ministers were told on 11 february that the virus could be catastrophic and decisive action was urgently required instead boris johnson told us to wash our hands and “go about our normal daily lives”  had the government acted in february we can hazard a guess about what the result would have been as the world has conducted a clear controlled experiment weighing south korea taiwan and new zealand against the uk the us and brazil south korea did everything the uk government could have done but refused to implement its death toll so far 263 it still has an occasional cluster of infection which it promptly contains by contrast the entire uk is now a cluster of infection  while other countries either closed their borders or quarantined all arrivals in the three months between the emergence of the virus and the uk’s lockdown 18 million people arrived on these shores of whom only 273 were quarantined even after the lockdown was announced 95000 people entered the uk without additional restrictions in fact on 13 march the uk stood down even its own guidance which had gently requested travellers from italy and china to selfisolate this decision taken as other nations were stepping up their controls seems baffling  similarly on 12 march johnson abandoned both containment and nationwide testing and tracking a week later the status of the pandemic was lowered which meant that the government could reduce the standard of personal protective equipment required in hospitals and could shift infectious patients into nonspecialist care again there was no medical or scientific justification for this decision  exercise cygnus a pandemic simulation conducted in 2016 found that the impacts in care homes would be catastrophic unless new measures were put in place the government insists that it heeded the findings of this exercise and changed its approach accordingly if this is correct by allowing untested patients to be shifted from hospitals to care homes while failing to provide the extra support and equipment the homes needed and allowing agency workers to move freely within and between them it knowingly breached its own protocols tens of thousands of highly vulnerable people were exposed to infection  in other words none of these are failures of knowledge or capacity they are depreparations conscious decisions not to act they start to become explicable only when we recognise what they have in common a refusal to frontload the costs this refusal is common in countries whose governments fetishise what we call “the market” the euphemism we use for the power of money  johnson’s government like that of donald trump and jair bolsonaro represents a particular kind of economic interest for years politicians of their stripe have been in conflict with people who perform useful services nurses teachers care workers and the other lowpaid people who keep our lives ticking whose attempts to organise and secure better pay and conditions are demonised by ministers and in the media  this political conflict is always fought on behalf of the same group those who extract wealth the war against utility is necessary if you want to privatise public services granting lucrative monopolies or fire sales of public assets to friends in the private sector it’s necessary if you want to hold down public sector pay and the minimum wage cutting taxes and bills for the same funders and lobbyists it is necessary if corporations are to be allowed to outsource and offshore their workforces and wealthy people can offshore their income and assets  the interests of wealth extractors are by definition short term they divert money that might otherwise have been used for investment into dividends and share buybacks they dump costs that corporations should legitimately bear on to society in general in the form of pollution the car and road lobbies or public health disasters soft drinks and junk food producers they siphon money out of an enterprise or a nation as quickly as possible before the tax authorities regulators or legislators catch up  years of experience have shown that it is much cheaper to make political donations employ lobbyists and invest in public relations than to change lucrative but harmful commercial policies working through the billionaire press and political systems that are highly vulnerable to capture by money in the uk us and brazil they have helped ensure that cavalier and reckless people are elected their chosen representatives have an almost instinctive aversion to investment to carrying a cost today that could be deferred delayed or dumped on someone else  it’s not that any of these interests – whether the daily mail or the us oil companies – want coronavirus to spread it’s that the approach that has proved so disastrous in addressing the pandemic has been highly effective from the lobbyists’ point of view when applied to other issues delaying and frustrating action to prevent climate breakdown pollution the obesity crisis inequality unaffordable rent and the many other plagues spread by corporate and billionaire power  thanks in large part to their influence we have governments that fail to protect the public interest by design this is the tunnel this is why the exits are closed this is why we will struggle to emerge  • george monbiot is a

440,when should british schools reopen heres what the science tells us,t  he big debate over the past few days has been whether it’s safe to open schools to children other than those those of key workers or classed as vulnerable however this isn’t quite the right question to be asking there will never be no risk in a world where covid19 remains present in the community it’s about how we reduce that risk just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers like driving and cycling what we should be asking is whether schools are safe enough to open to answer this of course you have to have data what is needed to inform decisions is information and realtime monitoring at the local level to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is those concrete numbers should be what drives policy not a set of abstract arguments even less an ideological battle  in the absence of this data the proposal to reopen schools in england on 1 june remains controversial among teaching unions the british medical association staff and parents alike our view is that schools should reopen as soon as possible but this must form part of a larger system of “test trace and isolate” strategies proper support and full transparency about the tradeoffs involved and the large scientific uncertainty  that scientific uncertainty surrounds two key questions the first is the degree to which children can transmit the virus to teachers and parents the second is the number of children likely to develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome several weeks after exposure to coronavirus a recent study in the lancet found a thirtyfold increase in children presenting with this condition in lombardy italy and the research team warned that other countries experiencing sarscov2 outbreaks would probably also see a rise in cases the numbers were small and the evidence suggests that the syndrome is likely to be uncommon but given that we still don’t have data on exactly how many children have been exposed to the virus we can’t make a calculation as to how rare it actually is  elsewhere we see that denmark norway germany and new zealand are starting to reopen their schools which raises the question of why those countries might be in a position to do so while the uk is not politicians desperate for answers point to a preliminary study from new south wales in australia that found that “close contact” in schools resulted in very little transmission however one major caveat is that research was conducted during a period when attendance had dropped to 5 enabling true physical distancing in addition early widespread implementation of community testing contact tracing and isolation of carriers across the country has helped to manage the number of cases australia is therefore easing its lockdown against a background of solid control of the virus the lesson from there and other nations with similarly effective regimes is that the uk needs to suppress the virus and ensure that public health infrastructure is ready to detect new infections and identify clusters rapidly  given the difficulties around maintaining physical distance in overcrowded state schools we need to identify innovative strategies involving the use of larger spaces phased reentry or both in denmark some schools have made use of spaces such as a football stadium that aren’t currently being used this may be a particularly useful tool in major cities with larger schools and class sizes germany has asked older children to return first while new zealand and israel have prioritised the return of children who are from vulnerable homes younger children who require adult supervision or pupils who have learning difficulties the decision to prioritise younger pupils – because the early years are fundamental to reducing educational inequalities – or to focus on older pupils – because they are better able to follow physical distancing rules and have exams and graduation ahead – is a political one  flexible thinking is key to balancing the competing demands of safety and educational need in the uk this could mean schools returning early from the summer holidays schools in new zealand and thailand have revised the dates of holidays for the remainder of the calendar year to make up for the teaching time lost during the lockdown all signs point to this virus hitting hard in the coming winter as flu season begins and activity moves largely indoors we should make optimum use of the summer months to get schools prepared and able to function alongside a strong public health infrastructure  given the higher number of coronavirus cases and active community transmission in the uk a conservative locally managed approach to schools reopening seems wise for example a system whereby the rate of transmission and the number of daily new cases in a given area must be below a set level before schools can reopen could be implemented – and then only if “test trace isolate” social distancing and hygiene and surveillance measures are in place these conditions should be agreed in consultation with teachers and school heads and public health child psychology and education experts  the tragedy is that the countries that moved the fastest and “crunched the curve” are those that never had to close schools or are in a strong position to reopen them quickly while the number of daily covid19 deaths grabs headlines we must not forget the children experiencing hunger from loss of school meals those living in abusive households and the widening educational deficit while many scientific and logistical questions remain what’s clear is that children especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds are truly paying the price for the uk

441,climate change is turning parts of antarctica green say scientists,scientists have mapped “the beginning of a new ecosystem” on the antarctic peninsula as microscopic algae bloom across the surface of the melting snow tinting the surface green and potentially creating a source of nutrition for other species  the british team behind the research believe these blooms will expand their range in the future because global heating is creating more of the slushy conditions they need to thrive  in some areas the singlecell lifeforms are so dense they turn the snow bright green and can be seen from space according to the study published on wednesday in the journal nature communications  biologists from the university of cambridge and the british antarctic survey spent six years detecting and measuring the green snow algae using a combination of satellite data and ground observation  facebook twitter pinterest study author andrew gray geotagging the snow algae blooms photograph dr matt daveyuniversity of cambridgesamsafp via getty images  the result is the first largescale algae map of the peninsular which will be used as a baseline to assess the speed at which the white continent is turning green due to the climate crisis and potentially offering sustenance to other species  they have already found the algae have formed close bonds with tiny fungal spores and bacteria “it’s a community this could potentially form new habitats it’s the beginning of a new ecosystem” said matt davey of cambridge university one of the scientists who led the study  he described the algae map as a missing piece of the carbon cycle jigsaw in the antarctic  antarctic temperature rises above 20c for first time on record read more  it identifies 1679 separate blooms of green snow algae which together covered an area of 19 sq km equating to a carbon sink of about 479 tonnes a year this is equivalent to the emissions of about 875000 car journeys in the uk though in global terms it is too small to make much of a difference to the planet’s carbon budget  almost twothirds of the green algal blooms were found on small lowlying islands around the north of the peninsula which has experienced some of the most intense heating in the world with new temperature records being set this summer the snow algae were less conspicuous in colder southern regions  scientists have previously observed an increase in green lichen and moss but these grow extremely slowly compared with algae in future they will also measure red and orange algae and calculate how the presence of such colourful forms might be affecting the heatreflecting albedo quality of the snow  “i think we will get more large blooms in the future before we know whether this has a significant impact on carbon budgets or bio albedo we need to run the numbers” said andrew gray the lead author of the paper
442,super cyclone amphan evacuations in india and bangladesh slowed by virus,the bay of bengal’s fiercest storm this century – super cyclone amphan – was bearing down on millions of people in eastern india and bangladesh on wednesday with forecasts of a potentially devastating and deadly storm surge  authorities have scrambled to stage mass evacuations away from the path of super cyclone amphan which is only the second “super cyclone” to form in the northeastern indian ocean since records began  but their efforts have been hampered by the need to follow strict precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic with infection numbers still soaring in both countries  many thousands of migrant workers are on the roads trying to get home from big cities after a nationwide lockdown destroyed their livelihoods  out at sea the vast weather system visible from space has winds of up to 240 kmh 150mph the equivalent of a categoryfour hurricane it is expected to ease slightly before crossing the coasts of west bengal and neighbouring bangladesh but could still be strong enough to “cause largescale and extensive damage” said the head of india’s weather office mrutyunjay mohapatra  in bangladesh residents of the island of bhola are moved to safety photograph district administration of bholaafp via getty images  the indian weather department forecast a storm surge of 10ft to 16foot 35mwaves – as high as a twostorey house – that could swamp mud dwellings along the coast uproot communication towers and inundate roads and rail tracks  storm surges can force a wall of water to cascade several kilometres inland and are often responsible for massive loss of life during the most severe cyclones  bangladesh’s lowlying coast home to 30 million people and india’s east are regularly battered by cyclones that have claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in recent decades  in 1999 the eastern state of odisha was hit by a super cyclone that killed nearly 10000 people eight years earlier a typhoon tornadoes and flooding killed 139000 in bangladesh  bangladesh authorities fear amphan will be the most powerful storm since cyclone sidr devastated the country in 2007 killing about 3500 people and causing billions of dollars in damage  the country has been working to bring 22 million people to safety while west bengal was relocating 300000 others  the catholic relief services crs aid group said people faced “an impossible choice” of braving the cyclone by staying put or risking coronavirus infection in a shelter  authorities in both countries said they were using extra shelter space to reduce crowding while also making facemasks compulsory and providing extra soap and sanitiser  “we are also keeping separate isolation rooms in the shelters for any infected patients” bangladesh’s junior disaster management minister enamur rahman told afp  although outside the predicted direct path of the storm there are fears for the safety of almost a million rohingya refugees from myanmar in southeastern bangladesh – most living in vast camps and housed in flimsy and makeshift shacks  the first coronavirus cases were reported there last week and by tuesday there were six confirmed infections  the un said emergency items such as food tarpaulins and water purification tablets had been stockpiled while authorities said the refugees would be moved to sturdier buildings such as schools  “heavy rains flooding and the destruction of homes and farmland will increase the likelihood of the virus spreading particularly in densely populated areas like the refugee camps in cox’s bazar” actionaid said  “it will also undoubtedly increase the number of lives and livelihoods already lost to this pandemic”
443,we give you 30 minutes malta turns migrant boat away with directions to italy,the armed forces of malta afm allegedly turned away at gunpoint a boat carrying migrants from their waters after giving them fuel and the gps coordinates to reach italy  exclusive footage is said to show an afm vessel refusing to rescue a small rubber boat carrying 101 asylum seekers reportedly in maltese territorial waters and instead providing them with the equipment to continue their journey to italy many of the migrants leapt into the water to try to reach the boat mistakenly thinking they were being rescued  “they came to us and said ‘malta has a virus called corona if you’ve heard about it we can’t take you there because everyone is sick in malta and malta is small and can’t take all of you’” one of the passengers who eventually made it to pozzallo in sicily on 12 april told the guardian “they gave us red life vests a new engine and fuel and told us they would show us the route to italy then they pointed guns at us and said ‘we give you 30 minutes’”  exclusive 12 die as malta uses private ships to push migrants back to libya read more  footage of the incident initially sent to alarm phone a hotline service for migrants in distress is destined to spark a row between italy and malta in early april both countries declared their seaports “unsafe” due to the pandemic closing their borders to migrant landings as a result boats carrying asylum seekers were left adrift in european search and rescue sar zones an unknown number died at sea of starvation dehydration or drowning  a report that alarm phone shared with the guardian states “over recent months and especially in april 2020 alarm phone has documented how the maltese authorities have orchestrated pushbacks from within the maltese sar zone sabotaged migrant boats failed to render assistance and to bring people to safety and left migrants to die off the maltese coast while organising their forced return to libya by private vessels”  when the flimsy and overloaded dinghy carrying the 101 migrants reached pozzallo there was amazement that such a small vessel with so many people aboard could make the 500km trip to italy from libya vessels of this size rarely carry enough fuel  the mayor of pozzallo roberto ammatuna argued “it is undoubtedly the new strategy of the traffickers who most likely transferred many desperate people from a mother ship to a smaller boat”  but a few weeks after their arrival in italy some of the 101 survivors have come forward to provide phone footage which raises serious concerns about the tactics of the afm  facebook twitter pinterest migrants being rescued on an inflatable dinghy belonging to the ‘ocean viking’ rescue ship last summer photograph anne chaonafp  the group had set off from zliten east of tripoli on the evening of 8 april after three days on the morning of 11 april they saw malta  “we saw commercial vessels big ones” said one of the survivors “they didn’t approach us at all around 5am when the sun started rising we saw malta we saw the buildings of malta everyone was happy and yelling’’  the migrants said they were intercepted by the vessel “they gave us life vests and around 20 or 25 people jumped into the water and almost drowned” said another survivor “so the maltese boat started turning around so we wouldn’t swim to the city they were likely to kill us they made waves they gave us ropes and told us to hold on to the ropes and tie them to our boat and go back”  according to the witnesses a second afm vessel arrived at the scene and an officer informed the dinghy passengers that malta was infected by the virus and unable to accept more people  “then one of the maltese officials said ‘ok we made a decision we won’t return you to libya’” said another survivor “he said ‘we will show you the route to italy’” we said ‘no we don’t have fuel’ they said ‘ok we will give you fuel’ they gave us five gallons 20 litres then we turned on the motor and it didn’t work we told the officials that the previous maltese vessel attached a rope to our boat to try pulling us back but it hit the engine many times and the engine broke they gave us a new engine a 45 or 40 yamaha”  the testimony matches photographs provided by the survivors in a photo taken before the encounter with the maltese a “parsun 60” motor can be seen afterwards “yamaha” is visible on the new motor which was allegedly provided at that point the maltese officials gave the migrants the coordinates to reach sicily  “we kept moving until the next day and around 10am we arrived in italy” said one of the asylum seekers  “does malta consider the manoeuvres driven by the afm vessel p02 in line with search and rescue operation standards and were the italian authorities informed about this case of 101 people in distress and about the presence of this boat before its arrival to the shores of sicily’’asks alarm phone  when contacted by the guardian the italian coastguard said malta did not alert them about the boat  afm and malta’s government did not respond to requests for comment  
444,palestinian leader mahmoud abbas ends security agreement with israel and us,declaration follows the creation of a new israeli government which is officially contemplating annexation of some areas of the west bank  the palestinian leader mahmoud abbas has declared an end to security cooperation with the israel and the united states citing the imminent threat of israeli annexation of parts of the west bank  “the palestine liberation organization plo and the state of palestine are absolved as of today of all the agreements and understandings with the american and israeli governments and of all the commitments based on these understandings and agreements including the security ones” abbas said in his speech  the plo voted to end cooperation with israel and the us in 2018 and left it up to abbas when to implement such a move the palestinian authority pa president has threatened to stop such cooperation several times before and it was unclear on tuesday what his declaration would mean in practice especially in terms of the future of the palestinian security apparatus  netanyahu takes office in deal that could see west bank annexation read more  “to pass the bar of credibility as a threat to show this is not the same as the umpteen threats that they’ve previously issued of a similar nature and that they never acted on the bar is very high” said daniel levy the president of the usmiddle east project “we will actually have to see palestinian action”  some reports from israel suggested that palestinian security officials had been ordered to stop talking to their israeli counterparts but palestinian officials have to coordinate with israeli officers even to move between areas within the west bank  abbas’s declaration follows the creation of a new israeli government which is officially contemplating annexation of some areas of the west bank apparently with the support of the trump administration  “i do think this moment is qualitatively different than any other moment in the past and that’s because israel does look like it is prepared to annex some part of the west bank” zaha hassan a human rights lawyer and visiting fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace said  “not only is there nobody to stop israel from moving forward but also the us is a partner to this plan”  according to israeli channel 13 television the israeli ambassador to the us ron dermer had been urging annexation before the us elections in november  “we must advance annexation now because we don’t know what will happen in the us presidential elections democratic candidate joe biden could win” dermer is reported to have said in confidential briefings in washington  “there is a window of opportunity now so it must be done now”  jordan’s king abdullah warned on saturday that israeli annexation could lead to “a massive conflict” between his country and israel and did not exclude a suspension of the 1994 peace treaty between them  abbas’s declaration could lead to the end of intelligence sharing between palestinian israeli and us security services but it gave no hint of what palestinian forces would do when israeli soldiers carry out incursions into palestinian areas or what it would mean for palestinian movement around the west bank between parts entirely administered by the pa area a jointly run areas b and israeli settlement zones area c  “what does it mean on the ground for pa security who – even to travel from area b to area b through area c – have to get permission from the israeli army does that mean that if everything is frozen that pa security can’t access certain parts of area b” asked khaled elgindy a fellow in the centre for middle east policy at the brookings institutions  “these are the kinds of questions that i think palestinians will be asking and then the israelis but i’m not sure there are clear answers”

448,coronavirus fallout to slow global growth in renewable energy,pace will slow for first time in 20 years with fewer windfarms and solar plants being built but rebound possible in 2021  the global growth of renewable energy will slow for the first time in 20 years due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic which will “hurt but not halt” the rise of clean energy  the world’s energy watchdog has warned that developers will build fewer wind farms and solar energy projects this year compared with a record roll out of renewables in 2019  but a rebound is possible in 2021 according to the international energy agency iea if critical government decisions made within the next few months support a green economic recovery from the pandemic  new figures from the iea predict that the world will grow its capacity of renewable energy by 6 or 167 gw this year the forecast growth is 13 less than the amount of new capacity which started up in 2019  the slowdown is likely to be more severe in europe the iea expects the amount of new renewable energy rolling out this year to fall by a third to its lowest annual growth rate since 1996  “countries are continuing to build new wind turbines and solar plants but at a much slower pace” said fatih birol the iea’s executive director “governments must not lose sight of the essential task of stepping up clean energy transitions to enable us to emerge from the crisis on a secure and sustainable path”  birol said the resilience of the renewables industry cannot be taken for granted and warned governments against reining in clean energy spending to weather the looming economic crisis wrought by the coronavirus  “the continued decline in renewable energy costs alone will not be enough to shelter the industry from the current crisis in my view the role of governments is more important than ever” he said “the decisions they make in the next few months will be a critical factor for the future of new renewable energy capacity build”  sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk  the uk government has promised to move ahead with an auction for renewable energy subsidy contracts next spring which will include bids from onshore wind and solar projects for the first time since the government lifted a block on financial support put in place four years ago  “many countries are now hesitating” birol said “but if support schemes are postponed or cancelled it will be a serious hit for the growth of renewables which we need badly to meet our climate goals”  the renewable energy industry will be the most resilient energy source through the covid19 pandemic according to the iea’s figures which predict that the impact of the virus will wipe out the growth in fossil fuel demand this year
449,taiwan president hits back at china amid covid19 success,taiwan will not accept attempts by china to “downgrade” its status its president has said in an inauguration speech that celebrated the island’s successful fight against the coronavirus and pledged to stand up to pressure from beijing  voters handed dr tsai ingwen a second term with a landslide win in january a vocal rebuke of beijing’s ongoing campaign to isolate the island  tsai who was sworn in on wednesday said both sides must find a way to coexist and called for stabilising relations with china which claims taiwan as its own and vows it will be brought under control by force if necessary  “we have resisted the pressure of aggression and annexation we have made the transition from authoritarianism to democracy” tsai said  “although we were once isolated in the world we have always persisted in values of democracy and freedom no matter the challenges ahead of us”  “we will not accept the beijing authorities’ use of ‘one country two systems’ to downgrade taiwan and undermine the crossstrait status quo” she said referring to the framework under which the troubled region of hong kong is governed by beijing  “we stand fast by this principle”  the comments drew a swift response from beijing which said china would never leave any room for “taiwan independence”  tsai’s remarks come as china prepares to host a key political event this week and after an international campaign to restore taiwan’s status as an observer to the world health assembly wha which beijing has blocked since 2016 just prior to monday’s wha meeting taiwan’s foreign minister announced with “deep regret and strong dissatisfaction” that they would put their bid on ice for now  beijing is facing growing international criticism over the virus which emerged in china late last year meanwhile taiwan’s global standing has been boosted by its response to the coronavirus pandemic which has been praised as effective without encroaching on the civil liberties of its citizens  taiwan responded quickly to the outbreak monitoring and screening incoming travellers from as early as 31 december enacting travel restrictions mandatory quarantine testing and phone tracking it also banned the export of face masks to ensure domestic supply after testing nearly 70000 people it has confirmed just 440 cases of the virus of which seven were fatal there have been no new confirmed cases in almost three weeks  recent months have seen an apparent uptick in provocative action by chinese forces in the seas separating the two regions including sending military flotillas and flybys towards taiwan and some calls for “reunification by force” from beijing  while analysts believe an invasion is not likely chinese state media has been quick to point out china’s military might  “what ultimately determines the direction of the situation across the taiwan strait is a contest of strength” said an editorial from the staterun global times published immediately after tsai’s speech  tsai had called on chinese leader xi jinping to help “prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences”  “cross strait relations have reached a historical turning point” she said “i also hope the leader across the strait will take on the same responsibility and work with us to jointly stabilise the long term development of cross strait relations”  just hours after tsai’s speech china’s taiwan affairs office said beijing would continue “to work together with people from both sides to deepen development” but that it would never tolerate any act separating taiwan from china or leave any room for any forms of independence  spokesman ma xiaoguang said reunification was “the natural trend of history” and they would not tolerate the interference of “external forces” in taiwan affairs the official xinhua news agency reported  tsai’s speech had also pledged growth and reform in taiwan several of her plans appeared to directly challenge china’s global interests including a pledge to develop a cyber security industry which integrated with the global 5g transformation china’s huawei technology company has come up against resistance and outright bans from some countries’ 5g networks because of security concerns  “we will strive to create a cybersecurity system and industrial chain which can protect our country and earn the world’s trust” she said  tsai noted the amount of attention taiwan had received over recent months and thanked citizens for their efforts in responding to the outbreak she said the island’s work during the pandemic had “changed the way the international community views taiwan” which presented both opportunities and challenges  “you have shown the world taiwan’s commitment to civic virtues even in times of greatest distress … this is is what solidarity feels like” she said “it takes more than fervour to govern a country”  prior to her speech us secretary of state mike pompeo said tsai’s “courage and vision in leading taiwan’s vibrant democracy is an inspiration to the region and the world”  pompeo’s remarks which were read out at tsai’s ceremony are the first to be delivered to a taiwanese president by a us secretary of state according to taiwan’s foreign ministry  the inauguration including dozens of wellwishes from foreign dignitaries and former leaders and politicians  the former us vicepresident joe biden who is hoping to challenge donald trump for the presidency sent his congratulations to tsai  “taiwan’s thriving democracy and response to covid19 are an example to the world america’s support for taiwan must remain strong principled and bipartisan”  the staterun global times quickly issued an editorial accusing pompeo of congratulating tsai to deliberately “challenge beijing”  “the us and taiwan want to play petty tricks at a low cost which is too naive we will make them feel pain in some places that they can’t think of” it said in a tweet  “washington and the tsai administration are so narcissistic that they think they can make the mainland uncomfortable and have nothing to do by saying a few words” it said  “what ultimately determines the

451,children of darfur revisiting those orphaned by the conflict,photojournalist paddy dowling travelled to sudan to find out what happened to those growing up in the midst of genocide  the darfur genocide claimed the lives of an estimated 300000 civilians forced 16 million people to flee their homes inside the country and a further 600000 refugees to spill across borders of neighbouring

darfur field office from 2007 to 2009 says humanitarian intervention for the most vulnerable including separated and orphaned children was part of the unhcr response “we work with affected populations and their host communities to provide shelter coordinate the work of partner agencies and ensure that idp camps and sites receive the attention they deserve”  “the protection of children cannot be in isolation of their communities who may continue to be exposed to risks even in displacement” she says “ensuring protection and solutions for idps in darfur is vital for a peaceful future for sudan”  international ngo qatar charity has worked with sudan’s governments past and present to protect the fatherless or orphaned young people in darfur through its “rofaqaa” sponsorship programme since the conflict began the scheme to date has ensured the provision of shelter food clean water access to education and protection to more than 3500 orphaned children in darfur and 12244 across sudan  however

453,peter gallagher one of the most toxic things in the world is success,t  he director robert altman used to tell peter gallagher the suave star of his 1992 movie the player “gallagher you’re so goodlooking it makes me sick” to hear gallagher impersonating the gruff auteur it was not quite a compliment but he was used to that  during a heated rehearsal for the real thing gallagher’s breakout role on broadway at the age of 29 another director mike nichols admitted to not being able to stand the sight of him “and we were close” says gallagher cheerfully speaking over zoom from his home in los angeles he responded by growing an “awful white goatee” until nichols pleaded for him to shave  critiques of gallagher’s performance often linger on his looks they seem integral to the cocksure ne’erdowells he plays from a vengeful spouse in altman’s short cuts to a lawyer sleeping with his wife’s sister in sex lies and videotape to the braggadocious “real estate king” in american beauty altman said he cast gallagher as a shortcut to character just his face communicating “handsome vain sleazy”  even at 64 gallagher continues to play bad guys an absent father in the sitcom new girl a threetime divorcee and whitecollar criminal in netflix’s grace and frankie “it has a lot to do with how i look” he agrees “when i was younger i had the kind of face that if i saw me walking down the street i’d say ‘what an asshole look at that rich kid who’s had everything handed to him fuck him’”  yet gallagher has little in common with his privileged parts from workingclass irishcatholic stock he carved out a 40year career in show business by “showing up” he says “the only thing i know is you’ve got to be willing to work harder than everybody else” even now quarantining at home gallagher is practising singing daily so as to “not completely go to seed”  the character he seems most like is sandy cohen the statesmanly patriarch of the 00s teendramedy the oc one of television’s greatestever dads “after bill cosby fell a few spots …” he jokes drily as a father to filmmaker james and musician kathryn gallagher says “i try to be sandy cohen i never ever wanted my kids to see me angry because i know that anger just stops a kid it chokes everything off”  gallagher’s own childhood was characterised by that emotional instability “the impression was we were always sort of living on the edge” he was born in new york city in 1955 the unplanned youngest of three he was close to his mother a bacteriologist but for much of his childhood she suffered from social anxiety and depression which he connects to her parents’ experience of emigrating to the us from ireland “she would be unable to get out of bed and i had to take care of her”  with kathleen york in the oc photograph channel 4  gallagher’s parents both of whom are dead fought constantly he remembers at age six seeing the family’s brandnew television sailing through the air “i used to pray for them to get divorced it was just so noisy sometimes”  later as an adult he saw the love between them and “that there was grace to be maybe had if you stayed the course” that has informed his own marriage to paula harwood a former producer turned interior designer whom he met in his first year at tufts university in massachusetts this month they mark their 37th wedding anniversary which is says gallagher “embarrassing for hollywood”  but his relationship with his father – a second world war veteran and advertising executive – casts a long shadow gallagher describes a distant dismissive figure “i would try my whole life to reach him just to get him to respond to me ‘dad what were you in the war’ ‘a general now go clean the gutters’ ‘dad what are taxes’ ‘you’ll figure it out’”  young gallagher took his father’s indifference as a personal failing in his career – he says in that cogent way that comes with therapy – he sought out surrogates such as nichols altman and his costars jack lemmon and peter o’toole lemmon gave gallagher a set of golf clubs o’toole took him to a football game  on stage following a script gallagher felt liberated finally confident he “wasn’t doing anything wrong” in fact he was getting enough right to land the part of danny zuko in grease on broadway from an open audition in 1978 yet he was not immune from the fickleness of show business he notes the irony of “the best creative experience i ever had” – 1984’s the real thing alongside glenn close and jeremy irons – precipitating his quarterlife crisis of confidence despite all his promise opportunities dried up now gallagher blames his agent then it coalesced with his “selfloathing lack of confidence” and childhood trauma “i started to question every morsel of my being until i couldn’t really function”  even in his depression gallagher recognised he was at a “transition point … i could keep banging my head against the wall and have a tragic outcome – or pay attention to what was going on inside” he quit the play and started over with therapy and acting classes “it was like a key into a lock”  focusing on the craft allowed gallagher to distance himself from the outcome – for better and worse what he identifies as his career low the 1992 broadway revival of guys and dolls was a critical and commercial hit but gallagher felt boxed in by the director prevented from giving his best that “rough treatment” led him to avoid musicals for 25 years  “when something works in show business it’s a miracle” says gallagher – so he has little time for big egos making it harder seeing someone get fired on a film set “just for a power thing” made a lasting impression “one of the most toxic things in the world is success i’ve seen people think they have all the answers like ‘if i’ve succeeded at this then there’s nothing i can’t succeed at’ you want to say ‘dude – you’re a member of the effin’ lucky club’”  given his consistent career it could seem surprising that gallagher never made it as a leading man in 1993 the new york times noted how “lady luck” was resistant to his “lubricious charm” gallagher puts it down to his inability with selfpromotion for years he wanted to prove that “it’s not who you know it’s how good you are” – but he laughs “that’s fucking stupid because who you know means a lot i just don’t have the confidence socially”  besides he says “i think the whole idea of stardom is kind of baloney i never really bought into it i wouldn’t have had the skills the way of thinking … i’ve seen the people who have achieved it and what they’ve done to get there”  there is more freedom to being a character actor he says more scope to surprise the benefit to playing bad guys is that the parts were often underwritten “they just wanted him to be an asshole … so it gave me a little elbow room” says gallagher in the 1995 romcom while you were sleeping he resisted the writers’ attempt to zhoosh up his character by making him an “awful person” instead of just poorly suited to sandra bullock “why burden the audience with someone to hate there’s just more opportunity in playing the character truthfully”  with laura san giacomo in sex lies and videotape photograph allstarvirgin  he served as a similar check on the oc at just 26 the showrunner josh schwartz was open to his input on “the parent stuff” says gallagher – so each week he and harwood would go through the script “aw jeez if i said that they should just send me to social services” “mischa barton who played troubled young marissa cooper spends the night with my business partner and i’m supposed to say ‘that’s cool’ no way”  for all the writers’ occasional “capriciousness” gallagher says the oc was successful because of “the organism of the ensemble” – and the timing post 911 the us had “run with the wrong ball” closing borders and embracing xenophobia “the most cowardly unamerican thing” sandy cohen was a corrective a principled public defender a new york jew married to a gentile californian “not afraid to welcome others into his home i thought that was the perfect story to be telling”  gallagher sees parallels with his latest project zoey’s extraordinary playlist which just concluded its first season on nbc e4 in the uk in the whimsical musical dramedy zoey hears others’ private thoughts as songs – highlighting for gallagher the importance of a sympathetic ear “in an era when we’ve been intentionally divided”  the trump presidency has special significance for bornandbred new yorkers he says sombrely “we knew his father was a white supremacist” he says but they didn’t take donald seriously until his attacks on the central park five a group of black teenagers who were wrongly convicted of the 1989 rape of a woman “we realised he was no longer funny there was a darkness and a willingness to do harm”  still it was a “nobrainer” to look to trump for buddy kane gallagher’s ludicrous character in american beauty “i thought who has the hugest opinion of themselves in real estate” gallagher was made heavier and older and approximated the “pouffey thing going on” with an old wig of cary grant’s “so when i was in bed with annette bening cary grant was on top of her”  twenty years on it is “heartbreaking” says gallagher to see the country “bamboozled by this con man … it really feels like they left the back door of the capitol open” he mimes a bandit egging others on “take anything you can and get the hell out before they catch on you want the parks”  and amid coronavirus the stakes have never been higher gallagher winces “it’s a little painful having been raised by a bacteriologist mother to hear someone blatantly disregarding science” his mother had helped to develop the romansky formula during the second world war revolutionising the administration of penicillin she died in 2004 after a 20year struggle with alzheimer’s disease  with jane levy in zoey’s extraordinary playlist photograph nbcnbcu photo bank via getty images  the experience informed his role in zoey’s extraordinary playlist he plays zoey’s father who is paralysed by progressive supranuclear palsy psp a somewhat similar brain disease “what gave me some relief was that psp doesn’t always find the same expression in people” says gallagher the series creator austin winsberg whose father died of psp was also a check “i knew that if i was screwing it up he’d go ‘no’ and if he was leaving because he had to cry i thought ‘i’m in the ballpark’”  gallagher has been gratified by praise from people with experience of psp or of caring for a parent – but some criticised his casting as an ablebodied actor what is his view that disabled parts should go to disabled actors that there is a limit to the experience that can be portrayed by acting gallagher flips the question “i would say people with disabilities shouldn’t be automatically excluded from playing any role” he notes that one episode features deaf actors and musical numbers in sign language and “hard and fast rules about who should do what” do not recognise the hurdles a project has to clear in order to get made he says with mounting and somewhat surprising impatience  the answer as he sees it is more and more diverse stories – and by that measure progress is fast he points to grace and frankie in which he plays jane fonda’s love interest “what an extraordinarily disruptive notion people older than 25 have life experience that deserves investigation and sharing” he says with goodnatured sarcasm “and my god – there are people 25 and under that want to watch”  it is the chance to be part of those stories that have “a place in the world” that keeps gallagher singing his scales in quarantine and he believes will see show business through the challenge of coronavirus “broadway was supposed to be over with 911 it turned out to be exactly what the world needed and what are people doing in quarantine they’re watching a lot of netflix because these stories are important”  and even the bad guys have a part days after 911 gallagher was asked to go to ground zero to boost the morale of emergency workers who had missed out on visits from the president and the yankees “the fires were still burning the smell of death …” gallagher’s last big picture had been american beauty “i’m thinking ‘what have i done with my life i’ve got to change jobs do something that counts” and all of a sudden one of the firefighters …” gallagher erupts in a newyoik holler “‘look who’s here ‘fuck me your majesty’ it’s the king’”  buddy kane was an asshole but they were still glad to see him

456,clicked back to life how netflix is reviving forgotten film flops,news last week that woody allen’s latest the amazondisowned a rainy day in new york was the world’s number one film at the box office spread fast mainly because of its inherent absurdity allen a figure associated more with critical acclaim than commercial success is currently outgrossing pixar’s onward with a film that might never see a us release a bizarro turn of events that felt indicative of what’s become a very surreal year in film  forget tiger king netflixs broken criminal justice docs are just as shocking read more  the overwhelming majority of global cinemas remain closed due to the ongoing pandemic and so allen’s blockbusting triumph was the result of having just opened in south korea a country that’s far ahead in the knotty process of restarting its economy without real box office numbers to analyse we’ve been forced to look elsewhere to find out what films people are watching and with its unparalleled dominance in the world of streaming the best place to look is of course netflix while the platform still refrains from any regular form of datasharing it drops the odd humblebrag when something hits big and has also implemented a daily top 10 feature which allows us to at least see what shows and films are the most watched even if we don’t know how many people are watching  while the list is often predictably led by the streamer’s latest highprofile original in large part a result of it receiving the most aggressive onsite promotion what’s become far more interesting to observe is the number of forgotten bmovies that have been nestling alongside granted a second life for an audience arguably far larger than they’ve ever had before in recent weeks the us top 10 has included teen horror house at the end of the street action thrillers sleepless and den of thieves factbased drama soul surfer single white female ripoff the roommate and scifi adventure lockout each of these films shares a number of characteristics a recognisable star lead a wide theatrical release and a middling or underwhelming performance at the box office so they land on netflix and are met with a vague awareness of the film but with a stronger familiarity attached to the actors propping them up the kind of combination that time and again has led to rental success in the past take 2017 for example what was the most rented title of the year wonder woman rogue one thor ragnarok nope it was the ben affleck thriller the accountant a film that did solid business theatrically but blew up at home consumers perhaps waiting for the most fitting price point for a film that didn’t demand the bigscreen experience  facebook twitter pinterest jamie foxx in sleepless photograph allstaropen road films  with netflix the psychology of what to watch is obviously very different with no cost attached to each individual film but with so much choice and with it being just one of many widely used services strong viewership for every new addition is by no means a guarantee higherprofile recent adds to us netflix including the curious case of benjamin button district 9 back to the future ace ventura pet detective and the artist all failed to make a showing in the chart what’s revealing is to then see what does cause people to click en masse and how a mostly forgotten film that might be part of a cheap bulk acquisition can gain a new fanbase an early sign of this came in 2015 when the netflix arrival of a very brady sequel led to an unusual viral afterlife for a comedy released almost 20 years earlier the film a wellreceived tongueincheek sequel to an update of the earnest family tv show made less then 22m at the us box office leading to the third film heading straight to the small screen its cultural impact was minimal but within weeks of landing on netflix two decades later it was responsible for a flurry of memes from an audience who were most likely not born when it came out sure jan remains in rotation now  we haven’t seen quite the same social media explosion just yet for any of the titles mentioned but without the standard may release schedule in place a thirst for the new is stronger than ever so now rather than rushing to see fast  furious 9 or black widow millions of americans are instead watching house at the end of the street a poorly reviewed 2012 thriller starring a prehunger games jennifer lawrence shot in 2010 and then shelved for two years the film eventually did average business on release but was promptly forgotten about as lawrence’s star continued to ascend but renewed interest it’s been in the us top 10 since being added to netflix on 7 may and trended on twitter soon after has led to film sites eager for content to post a deluge of clickbait pieces from looper’s the ending of house at the end of the street explained to screen rant’s house at the end of the street 2 will it happen spoiler it won’t the jamie foxx thriller sleepless has seen a similar trajectory lingering in the most watched for weeks after making only 20m in the us on release in 2017 see we got this covered’s an underrated jamie foxx thriller has been surprisingly popular on netflix  what’s encouraging for netflix is that these successes have emerged from smaller companies rather than big studios the reason this matters right now is that the increasingly fractured nature of streaming means that individual studios are taking back their own movies for their own platforms preexisting deals mean this hasn’t all happened automatically but soon disney will house all disney films and some familyfriendly fox titles hulu will have other fox movies including searchlight peacock will take universal films hbo max will have warner and new line titles and cbs all access will take paramount catalogue it’s one of the reasons netflix has been acquiring and producing so many “original” films to stock up to fill up their homepage with enough reasons to subscribe before the great drought begins this surge of clicks for films briefly leased from less prestigious companies those unlikely to launch their own platforms not only suggests to netflix that there’s life outside of the big studios but also helps them to figure out the formula for their own future original films  the platform’s two biggest success stories of late – spenser confidential starring mark wahlberg and extraction starring chris hemsworth now allegedly netflix’s biggest two film premieres ever – fall in line with the aforementioned bmovie hits reviews were tepid and plotting was simple but both were anchored by a recognisable star and millions were happy to press play without further expense given the muted box office clout of both actors outside of franchise fare wahlberg stumbled with deepwater horizon patriots day and mile 22 while hemsworth couldn’t turn bad times at el royale or in the heart of the sea into hits it’s unlikely these films would have made a dent theatrically yet scored over 85 million and 90 million online viewers apiece netflix has responded to the success by giving the green light to an extraction sequel another wahlberg action film described as a “bluecollar 007” and an actionheavy franchisestarter for another fallen star jessica alba rather than wait for bmovies to receive a second life years after a

neighbourhood trees heavy with fruit and the gentle scent of orange blossom and lemon oil on the breeze  for cornersmith’s alex elliotthowery the beginning of winter signals one thing lemon season  “my kitchen gets very busy at two times of the year – lemon season and tomato season lemon season stretches all throughout winter but as soon as you notice a massive price drop that’s when it’s time to go” says elliotthowery  time to go with what preserved lemons for a start plus marmalade pickles butters curds powders salts and basically any other flavour vehicle you can think of  lemon drizzle cake by anna jones photograph anna jonesthe guardian  elliotthowery harnesses the fruit’s bittersweet power at both her annandale cafe and marrickville picklery cooking school where she has created entire threehour class – when life gives you lemons – to foster a new appreciation for the underrated fruit  “lemons are the best flavour companion in the kitchen – they go with everything they can get a bit overlooked as they are so commonplace and cheap but they have so much hidden value” she says  “the first thing i teach is that every part can be used – the skin zest oils pips juice the insides – they are such a valuable ingredient”  in most parts of australia you’ll find three main kinds of lemon eureka is the standard likely to be found at the supermarket and ideal for preserved lemons or indianstyle pickles she says  quick lemon pickles photograph emma leethe guardian  meyer lemons are more delicate and thinskinned with less bitterness and pith and beloved by bakers for sweet applications finally there’s the gnarly bumpy bush lemon which is low on juice but great for salt preserving  “if you can get unwaxed lemons you’ve hit the jackpot – you’ll never find them at the supermarket” but lemon trees are common in australia’s suburban backyards “so knock on your neighbour’s door” says elliotthowery  “if you can’t get unwaxed but you want to preserve them pop the lemons in a sink full of warm water with a little bicarb and vinegar and give them a scrub and a rinse that will take some of the wax off”  how to maximise your lemon haul  it’s all about tucking your lemons into clever little applications you can use once the seasons is over and the supermarkets revert back to expensive or overseassourced produce  “before you juice a lemon you should peel it or zest it first then store it to last longer the zest can keep in the fridge for a few days in the freezer for a few months or you can put it in the oven to dehydrate and create a lemon powder”  “we put the lemon zest through butter a lot then cook a piece of fish in it – you really want to extract as much flavour as you can out of the parts that end up in the bin if you don’t have a lemon on hand you can still have lemon butter or strips of zest in the freezer or whatever”  if you want to pair lemon with some other citrus buddies marmalade is the way to go “marmalade uses the citrus skin it’s what differentiates it to jam – i like to make marmalade when i only have a couples of pieces of citrus because it uses the whole fruit”  thomasina miers’ sticky whisky marmalade brioche pudding photograph yuki sugiura food styling aya nishimurathe guardian  elliotthowery’s marmalade recipe just calls for 500g of mixed citrus with a handy chooseyourownadventure guide to flavour combinations with gentle herbs and spices try swirling lashes through lemon drizzle cake or sticky whisky marmalade brioche pudding for an instant hit of winter warmth  if you have a bit of patience the ultimate cornersmith recipe is for preserved lemons below  “preserved lemons are the thing you should make because they are expensive to buy but so easy to do – there’s so much salt in there nothing can go wrong” elliotthowery says  “people don’t know how to use them but you can add thin slices of preserved lemons to chicken soup mix with mashed avocado and chilli flavours or in a yoghurt raita with tomato and garlic it’s great in salad dressings marinades or potato salad or you can put it through hummus for a really bright zesty dip”  preserved lemons are expensive to buy and easy to do says elliotthowery photograph alex elliotthowery  preserved lemons  makes 2 x 500g jars  1kg lemons you may need extra for juicing if your citrus is dry – the very juicy lemons don’t need any extra juice  150g salt  in each jar of preserved lemons optional  1 bay leaf or alternatively 1 cinnamon stick and 2 cloves  1 allspice berry  5 black peppercorns  to sterilise your jars give your jars and lids a soapy hot wash and a good rinse or put them through the dishwasher put jars into a low oven 110c for 15 minutes once the lids are clean boil them for five minutes in a small saucepan then let them air dry  cut fruit into quarters or halves if very small put a tablespoon 20g of salt into the bottom of each jar put a few layers of lemon segments into the jar pressing down on the skin as you go to release the juices  photograph joey clarkmurdoch books  sprinkle another layer of salt then add another layer of segments slide spices into the side of each jar repeat the lemon layers and salt sprinkling until the jar is full remember to keep pushing down as you go  the fruit needs to be entirely covered in juice if your fruits haven’t released enough of their own juices squeeze a few extra lemons or limes and pour the juice over to cover  leave 1cm of head space between the top of the fruit and the lid you don’t want the salty fruit touching the top of the lid wipe the rim of the jar with a paper towel to remove excess salt seal the lid and let the jar sit in a cool dark place for six weeks  you know your lemons are preserved when the salt has completely dissolved into a gel like liquid once opened store in the fridge for up to a year  recipe extract from cornersmith recipes from the cafe and picklery alex elliott howery and james grant murdoch books rrp 4995

459,wild child by patrick barkham review – why children need nature,there is a certain grim irony in patrick barkham’s book coming out during lockdown his quiet but compelling arguments about the importance of kids getting out more and connecting to nature might appear slightly surreal at a time when children the world over have been so long stuck indoors barkham tells us how much the area over which children roam has shrunk over three generations little can he have imagined when he wrote wild child how much more constrained their lives were about to become  but precisely because of these extreme conditions wild child is a book that deserves to flourish a generation of children and parents is learning the harshest possible lesson about how precious our right to roam really is never have we valued our green spaces more as the passionate rows over the closure of city parks attests never have we thirsted so viscerally for the natural world with shops and entertainment venues closed many of us have taken the time to appreciate the bulbs coming up and the spring blossom on the trees in the absence of cars animals have been venturing into the streets much to the delight of children everywhere even if they have to watch it on youtube  one of the many inspiring things about this book is barkham’s insistence that you don’t need to live in the countryside to help your children enjoy and connect with nature often the wild spaces in our cities can be more interesting and ecologically diverse than intensively farmed agricultural land his three children’s love for the natural world is formed in a cemetery in norwich where they pick blackberries make friends with a stray cat and one memorable day spot two muntjac they dig a tiny pond in their back garden and soon find it brimming with insects snails frogs and newts  with these gentle tales of nature at its most accessible barkham who writes for the guardian is actually asking parents to think critically about our education system with its narrow focus on academic achievement and testing he volunteers in a “forest school” nursery where he sees how an outdoor setting fosters children’s resilience creativity and mental health the heroes of this book are a new generation of outdoor educators who are finding ways to reconnect children with nature in the face of a system that seems wilfully blind to its benefits  thanks to our involuntary crashcourse in home schooling parents today will be becoming more tuned in to what works for our kids – and what doesn’t inevitably this will inform what we want from schools it may open up possibilities for real change wild child gives us some bold and inspiring ideas about what an education system that is truly fit for the 21stcentury might look like  • wild child coming home to nature is published by granta rrp £1699 to order a copy go to guardianbookshopcom free uk pp on all online orders over £15

462,universities beware shifting classes online so quickly is a doubleedged sword,w  hen lockdown began universities had to shut up shop like any other nonessential service but something extraordinary happened universities around the world went online almost overnight showing remarkable determination to continue providing their students with lectures seminars and tutorials  but can this rapid shift to online teaching and learning actually work in the long term several problems have already emerged online teaching needs more than just the basics lecturers need access to a computer that supports teaching software and a reliable internet connection meanwhile for students even basic hardware and software are far from guaranteed in many homes as families share equipment and internet providers struggle with increased traffic  there are also structural issues with internet privacy and security online teaching potentially exposes students to unreliable data protection laws in many countries neither freedom of speech nor privacy can be guaranteed for students’ ideas and personal data this is no small matter for universities given they are meant to be sites of free academic discussion and debate online universities can hardly be free when the internet itself is unfree  the problem is exacerbated when universities rely on large corporates like microsoft for online platforms such as teams universities have little control over how online platforms are run and priced in the overnight dash to online teaching they have also shown little caution in both contributing to profitmaking of corporates and compromising data on servers universities themselves do not control imagine students agreeing to give up their ideas and information to be stored at an unknown location and with little control over how they are used in years to come knowingly or unknowingly universities may be contributing to surveillance capitalism  the hardware and software for online teaching are not insurmountable issues but they do require some deep reflection and open conversation should universities invest in homegrown opensource software can they provide foolproof platforms which do not compromise the security of students unfortunately this conversation has been sidelined even halted by the rush to go online but if online teaching is to continue beyond this pandemic this conversation should be had  there are also important questions to be answered about the best way to teach online we need to question the assumed value in simply going “live” on camera recorded lectures simply replicate the passive learning environment of classrooms and online seminars and tutorials fail to elicit meaningful student interaction  instead let’s reimagine online teaching for this we may have to get away from the concept of contact hours in lectures seminars and tutorials instead there should be longerterm engagement from students through discussion forums or weblogs which allow sustained freewheeling conversation  on my own human rights course we allow students to develop arguments in turn like chain novelists over the course of several days tutors act as moderators and respond to students outside of class hours in a way that gives them greater control of their own schedule and priorities more time does not necessarily contribute to more screen time this gives students more freedom to reflect and respond with deeper thinking and more sophisticated arguments than is possible in a classroom setting  in fact the greatest value of online learning can be in building a community more importantly it can diversify the student community by reaching out to learners who aren’t able to be part of a residential university environment both locally and internationally this includes mature students returning to university to learn new skills people with disabilities or those from disadvantaged backgrounds    open and free higher education will be particularly important as we rebuild our society postcoronavirus pandemic cultivating healthy and curious minds may be no small contribution in a public health crisis let’s hope the shift to online gives universities a renewed sense of public purpose
463,immigration bill shows uk ministers value strawberries more than people needing social care  karolina gerlich,over the past few weeks i have been kept awake by worries about care workers  more than 130 in england and wales have already died working on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis having been let down by shortages of personal protective equipment ppe a lack of testing and little recognition that they are putting their lives at risk every day  as someone who’s been a care worker for the past 12 years and still works one morning a week this makes me angry and very anxious for the future of social care  selfisolating uk care workers face debt and hunger warns charity read more  there has never been a question in my mind whether care work is high or low skilled supporting people to live the lives they want is one of the most difficult jobs there is  care work is a very rewarding but hard profession that requires skills and values not everybody has empathy love and care care staff are always putting people they support before their own needs and doing whatever it takes to deliver the best quality of care possible during this crisis care workers have had to take on new responsibilities such as certifying causes of death or delivering wound care that would previously have been carried out by district nurses that is on top all of the other duties care workers perform seemingly in the shadows with society oblivious to their contributions  the government’s new immigration policy which was voted through the house of commons on monday night seems to ignore all of that  it classes care workers as “low skilled” and while special exemptions have been made for visas for fruit pickers none have been made for care workers  to me that means that the government values strawberries more than it does elderly and vulnerable people and others who need care to me it says that the amazing work care workers do every day is still not understood recognised or respected i am furious and saddened that yet again social care is being ignored and pushed to the back of the queue in terms of its importance to the economy and society  care work is not glamorous but it is fulfilling the deep misunderstanding of the profession and the sector as a whole has led to decades of underfunding by different governments and lack of parity with the nhs one cannot exist without the other with the social care workforce larger than that of the nhs and right now both sectors are working against the pandemic that has taken over the country  the majority of the social care workforce is on low pay living pay cheque to pay cheque looking after people while worrying about paying bills and feeding their children  those who are shielding and selfisolating are having to make tough decisions between doing the right thing and their finances  applications for my charity’s grants have increased 1000 week on week compared with last year we have been desperately fundraising to support as many people as possible low pay and lack of respect reinforce the notion that care work is unimportant and that the needs of care providers for staff from overseas are not a priority  sign up for society weekly our newsletter for public service professionals read more  this cannot continue on thursday when people “clap for carers” we are asking them to shout loud and clear that care workers are essential highly skilled and of huge value to society most of all we want to demand that care workers are finally acknowledged as professional highly skilled and essential to all of us for the sector to receive the funding it needs and to be allowed to recruit far and wide to ensure everybody gets the help they need  remember one day it might be you in need of care and there may not be enough care workers around to support you you will have your strawberries but where will be the support for your wellbeing
464,will donald trump end up in prison he could be a step closer …  arwa mahdawi,obamagate obamagate donald trump seems to think that if he yells “obamagate” often enough and loud enough it will magic a scandal into existence and send his archnemeses barack obama and joe biden to jail  on monday the us attorney general william barr burst his boss’s bubble and dismissed the possibility of a criminal investigation into obama or biden because you know they didn’t do anything wrong trump responded to barr’s statement in his usual fashion sulking like a petulant child and saying “well if it was me they would investigate” before continuing to babble incoherently  it may be wishful thinking but i have a feeling that one reason trump is so keen to accuse obama and biden of criminality is because he is starting to get nervous about going to jail himself last week biden pledged that if elected president he wouldn’t use his executive powers to pardon trump of potential crimes this wasn’t the first time the presumptive democratic nominee has said he wouldn’t go easy on trump in october biden told an iowa radio station that it had been a mistake for gerald ford to pardon his predecessor richard nixon after watergate in 1974 pardoning trump biden said “wouldn’t unite the us” and would send the message that some people are above the law  of course as it stands the us president is above the law in 1973 amid the watergate scandal the department of justice adopted the position that a sitting president is “constitutionally immune” from criminal prosecution a position it reaffirmed in 2000 as long as he is president trump is safe  when he leaves office however it is another matter there are a host of charges he might face these include obstruction of justice charges in relation to the russia investigation illegally withholding military aid to ukraine in order to pressure them to investigate his political rivals and soliciting campaign donations from foreign nationals – all of which trump denies according to the investigative site the intercept the laws trump has potentially broken in his interaction with ukraine and china as president could land him 10 years in prison  and it is not just trump’s conduct as president that has opened him to potential legal trouble there is also the matter of his financial and tax dealings which are the subject of numerous lawsuits  importantly how long trump stays in power has a bearing on any potential legal liability the statute of limitations on obstruction of justice charges for example is only five years so if trump gets another term he will run down the clock on that honestly if you want to do the crime without doing the time it really pays to be president  if trump ever goes to jail it will be one of the happiest days of my life not everyone is so enthusiastic about “locking him up” however earlier this year the then democratic presidential candidate andrew yang said that if he were president he wouldn’t investigate trump “if you look at history around the world it’s a very very nasty pattern that developing countries have fallen into where a new president ends up throwing the president before them in jail”  look i understand that the us where people die because they can’t afford diabetes medication doesn’t want to be like a “developing country” nevertheless there is a very nasty pattern into which authoritarian regimes have fallen where the leader does whatever they like with no repercussions i am not sure the us wants to be like that either  i have no idea what the chances of trump ending up in prison are but i am pretty sure he is not happy that there is even a small possibility he might swap the white house for the “big house” but his approval ratings are dropping and the chances of a president biden are rising that means trump is going to do everything he can to win reelection in november he is not just fighting for another term he is also fighting for his freedom he is fighting to avoid the possibility of a trumpgate  • arwa mahdawi is a guardian columnist
465,its time to dismantle factory farms and get used to eating less meat  gene baur,slaughterhouses are a breeding ground for disease and hotspots for coronavirus and dozens closed after thousands of workers became ill president trump ordered these operations open and shielded them from legal liability for exposing disempowered workers to intolerable risks at the same time the government is spending 200m per month to support the meat and dairy industries while agribusiness lobbies for more stimulus money to return to killing as normal industrial animal agriculture harms people animals and the earth and it should not receive government bailouts it should be dismantled and replaced to put it bluntly it’s time to get used to eating less or no meat  factory farms and slaughterhouses demand a continuous supply of low paid deemed expendable workers to perform dangerous and difficult tasks to meet this need agribusiness has obtained regulatory accommodations to exploit immigrant and prison labor still the industry has faced chronic labor shortages and their killing capacity could not keep up amid the recent spate of coronavirus infections in slaughterhouse workers causing slaughterbound animals to back up in the supply chain millions of these innocent creatures have been euphemistically “depopulated” meaning killed and discarded these deaths are tragic but so are the billions of needless deaths that occur in the normal course of business we can live well without exploiting and consuming other animals  more than 9 billion farm animals are pushed through factory farms in the us and every year hundreds of millions die before even reaching the slaughterhouse the industry considers individual animals and workers for that matter to be expendable as long as the system is profitable chickens raised for meat for example have been genetically altered to grow four times faster and larger than normal which causes painful maladies and results in millions of birds who die before being sold for slaughter these early deaths are considered acceptable to the industry because the profits generated by the faster growing chickens outweigh the costs  industrial animal agriculture harms people animals and the earth and it should not receive government bailouts  as we look to a postpandemic world we should envision a more resilient and sustainable food system one that doesn’t commodify sentient life we can feed more people with less land and fewer resources through plant based agriculture which would significantly lighten our ecological footprint and free up millions of acres of land since we use ten times more land in the us for animal agriculture than for plant farming shifting to eating plants instead of animals would enable natural ecosystems wildlife habitat and biodiversity to return it would allow the earth to regenerate and heal and reduce threats from the climate crisis and future pandemics which have been linked to our abuses of other animals and the environment  the inflexible supply chains exposed during the pandemic should be shorter and more nimble with consumers connected more closely with the source of their food and farmers the widespread interest in gardening spurred by the pandemic is encouraging home gardens could supply more food than we realize like victory gardens which grew 40 of our nation’s produce during world war ii urban farming farmers markets community supported agriculture programs and community gardens can provide nutritious food and meaningful jobs in diverse settings and were spreading before the pandemic hit these deserve more government and institutional support instead of factory farms and slaughterhouses  agribusiness is using its undue influence to obtain billions of stimulus dollars being spent in the wake of this pandemic and has exploited government programs to fund factory farming for decades a study released in 2018 found an astounding 73 of dairy industry income in 2015 more than 22bn came from the government in 2018 and 2019 agriculture received 14bn and 16bn respectively for lost trade on top of the billions it already gets each year the industry has also had preferential access to scarce resources like water at below market cost and exemptions from labor environmental animal welfare and other laws that allow it to avoid liabilities so it can externalize costs born of its irresponsible conduct this needs to stop  instead of killing animals exploiting workers and despoiling the environment we can feed ourselves sustainably and help heal the earth through communityoriented plantbased agriculture farmland that is currently growing monocrops with petrochemicals for animal feed can switch to producing legumes grains fruits vegetables pulses nuts seeds and other crops directly for human consumption suburban lawns can be turned into gardens and in urban settings food is already being grown on empty lots in school and church yards on rooftops in food forests in containers and planting boxes and even in abandoned buildings reconfigured into vertical farms this is a positive trend that should be encouraged  as we look to the future let’s seek to create a new “normal” without factory farms and slaughterhouses government policies that have enabled abuses should be redirected to support a healthier more diversified system that sustains vibrant communities and produces food that is nourishing instead of returning to the broken status quo that causes so much pain and suffering for both people and animals and for our part it’s time to get used to eating less or no meat

468,uefas aleksander ceferin football with fans will come back very soon  sebastián fest,the most important official in european football talks to the guardian about the coronavirus fallout how clubs could face a “luxury tax” and why he believes footballers are not greedy below is an edited transcript  how would you describe the current situation and your feelings about it there’s a lot of work still to be done i was in switzerland last week for the first time in two months and had meetings from 9am to 11pm there is so much information to take in and so many calendar issues – and so many millions and millions dozens of millions of dollars that we will lose it is then hard to fall asleep at night you would be quite irresponsible if you could fall asleep immediately after a day like that the situation for uefa is not that alarming we’re not in a dangerous situation but we still care about the clubs and the leagues and the stakeholders so it is a lot of work  footballs leaders put squabbles aside to strike heartening tone in a crisis read more  how and when did you decide to postpone euro 2020 in these kinds of situations do you wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it it’s even worse i couldn’t even fall asleep until 4am at that time in the morning i made the decision about euro 2020 and then fell asleep for a couple of hours  would you bet a million dollars that euro 2020 will be played in 2021 yes i would … i don’t know why it wouldn’t be i don’t think that this virus will last for ever i think it will change sooner than many think  what gives you that impression it’s a serious situation but it is going down now and we are being more cautious we know more about the virus and in general i’m an optimistic person i don’t like this apocalyptic view that we have to wait for the second and third waves or even a fifth wave … people you know are likely to die one day but do we have to be worried today i don’t think so we are ready and we will follow the recommendations of the authorities but i’m absolutely sure personally that good old football with fans will come back very soon  football didnt change after the second world war or first world war and it will not change because of a virus either aleksander ceferin  is this going to change football for ever i don’t think that anything will change for ever it’s a new experience and when we get rid of this bloody virus things will go back to normal football didn’t change after the second world war or first world war and it will not change because of a virus either people have said many times that the world will not be the same after … this might be true but my point of view is why not think that the world will be better after this virus why not think that we will be smarter or finally understand how fragile we are how unprotected we are towards nature so there are always lessons to be learned  what are your thoughts about the suggested new 24team club world cup you said earlier this year that this could mean the death of football what i meant by that was mainly because of the way it was presented it was presented as if a fund would buy the competition and that the whole competition would be sold we didn’t have any more information than that and even now i don’t have much more information but as far as i know the fund is gone and to be honest i don’t know in which direction this idea is going for now we didn’t discuss it much i don’t even know when exactly a cwc would be played so i don’t think there is anything to worry about for now  do you still want to launch this third european competition the uefa europa conference league or has this situation made you think twice about it we will do it absolutely  in 2021 or will you delay it we will not postpone it  what about financial fair play and its future are you still committed to the current rules and how important is it that the clubs get sanctioned if they disobey the rules if they don’t follow the rules they will always be sanctioned but of course we are always thinking about how we can improve our regulations and if necessary adapt to new times this will not happen very soon but we are thinking of improving ffp modernising it and doing something more about the competitive balance we are also considering some sort of “luxury tax” if it is possible so there are many ideas but trust me during these difficult times we have stopped thinking more or less about changes that will happen in the future now we have to steer our ship on to the right course and we are close to doing it then when things calm down we will go back to the old tasks  facebook twitter pinterest manchester city’s riyad mahrez in action against real madrid ‘there are too many people commenting on different topics that they do not have a clue about’ ceferin says of city’s ban from european competition photograph alex livesey  danehousegetty images  before the covid19 crisis there was the case and sanction of manchester city is uefa still supporting the chamber’s findings are you still fully behind the guilty verdict and the twoyear ban look the decision was made and now the case is at the court of arbitration for sport and cas will decide that’s absolutely all i can say for two reasons firstly the independent bodies made the decision i didn’t and secondly i really don’t know the case well enough and i don’t like people who comment about matters that they don’t know well there are too many people commenting on different topics that they do not have a clue about  so the possibility of a deal or a settlement outside court is not an issue for you i don’t want to comment on this case any more    let’s switch to women’s football how close are we to equal pay for women and men in football this is the onemilliondollar question rather than if the euros will be held next year i think it is hard because there is a big difference in the revenue between what men’s and women’s football bring uefa is investing a lot into women’s football and we’re very happy with it  women’s football is increasingly popular… but with equal pay it’s really very hard to say something now  at the start of the coronavirus crisis the fifa president gianni infantino said this was a chance to reorganise and reduce the amount of football being played do you agree i don’t know i tried to understand what he meant with that but for sure it’s strange that on the one hand you say you want to reduce football and on the other hand you propose a new competition called the club world cup is that reducing the amount of football  facebook twitter pinterest aleksander ceferin right with gianni infantino president of fifa and theodore theodoridis general secretary of uefa photograph alexander hassensteinuefa via getty images  have you had the chance to discuss it with infantino no i didn’t have a chance and we don’t discuss much to be honest we haven’t talked much during this crisis … but when the time comes we will discuss it but i don’t want to speak about his opinion in the media when there is something official then i will ask for answers    a lot has been made about players’ salaries do you think that players should be a bit more humble and bit less greedy and that clubs should be a little bit wiser with their spending i don’t think players are greedy they are not greedy the market decides the prices and if you or i would get an offer to be paid 20m per season i don’t think you or i would say ‘no no no i don’t want to be greedy give me 200000’ so they’re not greedy the market decides but now let’s see if the market response to this crisis means that the prices go down it’s possible that prices will go down but i don’t think it’s fair to say that the players are greedy that the players are not fair because their salaries are so high they also bring a lot of revenue and football is a big industry that pays a huge amount of taxes the player is also paying huge taxes so i don’t think that the right word is greediness or that the clubs should be wiser because it’s simply the market that decides how the prices are moving  sebastián fest is an

469,world watches with relief as bundesliga makes a safe return – for now,a resumption that passed off without any disasters was greeted with a generally positive reaction by the press though some fans are still to be convinced  there was said thomas müller “a tingling sensation because it was starting again” not nervousness he was quick to stress but an opening day of the season feeling as the bundesliga got back out of the blocks this time it was with an atmosphere of the ultimate juxtaposition – in echoey stadiums but with the whole world watching  “gedämpfte freude” – muffled joy – was how the headline in monday’s edition of kicker put it set across a photo of borussia dortmund’s players saluting a cavernous empty südtribune after their emphatic 40 revierderby win over schalke on saturday afternoon “it was spontaneous” said the midfielder julian brandt and that was key to a weekend which was a string of unusual occasions  eerie silence resounds as germany ushers in football’s new abnormal  barney ronay read more  it was brandt’s teammate erling braut haaland who had scored the first goal of the postlockdown bundesliga a typically instinctive finish that was followed by an untypical physicallydistanced celebration by the corner flag in signal iduna park’s southwest corner frankfurter allgemeine’s christian kamp joked that lucien favre bvb’s detaildriven coach had even mapped out every move of his team’s formation for the moments immediately after scoring  yes even the manner of postgoal festivities were examined forensically – when does an elbow bump go too far up the forearm some asked – with hertha’s delight at their 30 win at hoffenheim becoming a little bit too authentic their captain vedad ibisevic already implicated in the nowsuspended salomon kalou’s infamous facebook live video hugged the assist provider maximilian mittelstädt and his fellow forward matheus cunha after scoring the middle goal which is discouraged by the dfl but not a punishable

look after my team”  by sunday evening müller when substituted towards the end of bayern’s 20 win at union berlin got away with planting a gentle kick on the backside of the head coach hansi flick as an improvised salutation on his way to sit down substitutes sit in the stand not on the bench with three seats between each player müller also dryly remarked that there was a touch of “old men playing at 7pm” about a dialleddown occasion particularly at a stadium “where the mood can tip the scales” but even if bayern’s victory required more attrition than flick would have hoped it seemed as if there was at least some sort of conditional new normal as the sun began to set in the capital  the global reaction to the bundesliga’s return was generally positive with obrigado bundesliga from portugal’s a bola typical of the continentwide relief that the raising of the curtain had passed relatively setbackfree though spain’s el mundo deportivo commented that it “would have been good if a minute’s silence had been observed for the victims of coronavirus” the aspect not just of being entertained – and the general standard of play was way better than might have been expected after 66 days of unscheduled stoppage – but of viewing possible best practice is clear  facebook twitter pinterest hertha’s matheus cunha centre is congratulated by teammates vedad ibisevic right and maximilian mittelstädt after scoring in the 30 win at hoffenheim photograph thomas kienzleepa  eintracht frankfurt’s sporting director fredi bobic who called the restart “a historic day for the bundesliga” also told sky that the league could be a litmus test for all sports “we also received a tremendous number of calls from american clubs for information” said the former bolton striker “not only from football clubs but also baseball basketball and ice hockey they all want to know how we’re doing it and how we organised it “  for beyond the wetwiping of balls electronic sensors to

bundesliga audience this season whether this will continue in germany is open to debate dazn is offering a free month’s subscription and the dfl says it is “in talks” regarding forthcoming matches  yet just as the league’s ceo christian seifert talked of “earning” another round of fixtures with each successfully rolledout round under these hygiene measures the bundesliga has a long way to go to

return read more  seifert’s message has been that the country’s 36 professional clubs need the resumption to survive but there are a proportion of fans who don’t believe him – or think that what football has become is not even worth saving  some are seizing the opportunity to promote a favoured cause in the aftermath of schalke’s humbling in the derby their chairman clemens tönnies – who is lucky to still be in his role after a racism scandal last year – spoke to sky again about the possibility of restructuring the club’s governance model an idea which might find more eager ears in a time of financial uncertainty the 501 rule is also likely be examined by those who wish to bring the bundesliga more in line with the rest of europe  the coming week will present new challenges as the players return to their homes and families before the next fixtures beyond the hygiene protocol the longterm health of the bundesliga will also be under close scrutiny as it continues to spread its wings like never before  talking points  • there was more good news for bayern after they restored their lead to four points with their win in berlin karlheinz rummenigge told sky he was “cautiously optimistic” that contract talks with manuel neuer would reach a positive conclusion a feeling reciprocated by the goalkeeper weeks after the two sides had been poles apart  • there were some minor musical chairs in the top four with borussia mönchengladbach moving above leipzig into third with a 31 win at frankfurt – julian nagelsmann’s team were held by freiburg gladbach scored twice in the

477,have any football champions gone out of business faster than hallelujah fc  the knowledge,“hallelujah fc who were the first professional club in south korea won the inaugural kleague in 1983” writes kári tulinius “two years later they had ceased to be professional and continued as an amateur club until 1998 when they were dissolved despite the name they were never resurrected has any professional club been permanently dissolved so soon after being champion”  it turns out there are plenty of examples of champions who have tumbled into oblivion in doublequick time “there are quite a few in eastern europe and the baltic states” writes jack mey “unirea urziceni won the league title in romania in 2009 by the end of the 201011 season they had been relegated and were subsequently wound up in estonia lantana tallinn won the league title twice in 1996 and 1997 the club was disbanded in 1999 over the border in latvia fk vindava from the city of ventspils won the latvian

champions have suffered the biggest fall from grace  the knowledge read more  john morrow takes us to the emerald isle “it has been a regular occurrence in the volatile league of ireland especially in cork where the predominance of dublin clubs in the league meant crippling travel expenses cork united emerged in 1940 after the dissolution of cork city a separate entity to the current league of ireland members and took the league by storm winning three consecutive titles and adding two more in 1945 and 1946 a mere two years later however and they too were gone dolphin were a dublin club who won the title in 1935 but resigned in 1937 unable to compete with the more established city clubs”  dean whearty has another league of ireland example “sporting fingal – founded in 2007 and dissolved in 2011 – had 965 days between their first and last match in that time they won the domestic cup won promotion to the top division finishing fourth in their one and only season and lost a dramatic europa league tie 64 to maritimo”  it would appear the us is also a hotbed for champions who fell hard and fast “kansas city spurs founding members of the nasl won the championship in 1969 having the best record in the second part of the season they folded in 1970” recalls stephen moffit “in 1983 tulsa roughnecks were 20 winners of the soccer bowl against the toronto blizzard the nasl of course folded in 1984 the roughnecks played friendlies for one more season before ceasing to exist”  but dave mellinger can offer us two champion clubs who disappeared so quickly their crowning wins were mere whispers in the wind “in 2009 in the top tier of us wps the los angeles sol won the regular season which ended on 9 august this being the states there was also a playoff winner but we’ll ignore them for now before the next season started the team was dissolved – on 28 january 2010 only 172 days later the sol were tortoises however compared to what happened next the following season fc gold pride won the playoff championship on 26 september 2010 – they had won the regular season shortly before – and folded never to be resurrected on 16 november of the same year that’s a harelike 51 days

478,merger of equals johanna konta backs idea to combine atp and wta tours,johanna konta has cautiously offered her support to the idea of the atp and the wta tours merging  while discussions about the viability of a merger were pushed into the spotlight by tweets from roger federer in april – since when both atp and wta chief executives andrea gaudenzi and steve simon – have expressed support for it konta has underlined that it remains only an idea  ‘ive been going bananas without it’ tennis obsessives pick up their rackets again read more  “billie jean king beat him federer to that a long time ago” konta said “so i think it is something that has been talked about for a long time but having roger vocalise it drew attention to it i definitely think in the long run it makes sense for it to be one tour it makes logical sense but i also know there are a lot of moving parts to it and i know there will be a lot of people who won’t want it to happen but also a lot of people who do want it to happen”  a prominent member of the wta player council – which has convened frequently since the tour suspension – konta points out that “not so much” has been said since the initial discussion following federer’s tweets should anything come to fruition she stresses the need for equality  “for me for my comprehension i don’t understand how it wouldn’t be of equals because if we are then talking about that would it be us literally saying we are worth less than our male counterparts it would have to be a merger of equals because that’s what we are i wouldn’t see how right now in today’s age it would be allowed to be called anything else”  it is not difficult to understand konta’s caution this time last year her run to the semi‑finals at roland garros ended against marketa vondrousova after they were forced on to a half‑empty stadium away from the show courts following bad weather she said afterwards that she was tired of women having to “justify their scheduling or their involvement in an event or their salary or their opportunities” she understands the potential cost of the wta losing its independence  facebook twitter pinterest johanna konta played marketa vondrousova during the semi final of last year’s french open in front of a sparse crowd photograph richard sellerspa  as eloquent as konta has always been on general issues she can be less forthcoming about her own tennis she often projects her mentality cocooning herself in relentless positivity it can be difficult to know how she really feels one year later it is refreshing to hear an honest reflection of her parisian fortnight  sign your own balls tennis and golf take first tentative steps out of lockdown read more  “to make it to the semis for the first time since 2017 was something special but then there was bit of heartbreak for me … it was a tough match to lose because i had opportunities and my opponent played well definitely whoever was going to lose that match was going to hurt and it definitely hurt but i can look back and say i am a semifinalist at the french open and it’s something i can be proud of and who knows i may get another opportunity”  as for now konta’s ongoing knee injury is “getting there” but is something she will always have to manage she is open to contesting the planned lta national tournaments as the tour remains frozen now suspended until at least 31 july with the us open’s status to be declared in midjune she has started the johanna konta podcast to pass the time she misses strolling to her favourite cafe in battersea park  “i miss people being relaxed as well” the 29yearold player said “when you’re outside you can feel people being anxious i think there are quite a lot of angry people about although there are a lot of very kind people who are being more friendly than normal and want to interact but there is a lot of anxiety about”

481,canada police say machete killing was incel terror attack,authorities say they have evidence tying toronto attack in which a woman was murdered and two others injured to ‘incel’ movement  police in canada are treating a machete attack in which a woman was murdered and two others injured as an act of terrorism after discovering evidence suggesting that it was motivated by violent misogyny  the move is thought to be the first time that terrorism charges have been brought in a case connected to the socalled “incel” ideology  “terrorism comes in many forms and it’s important to note that it is not restricted to any particular group religion or ideology” the rcmp said in a statement announcing the updated charges on tuesday  the suspect who has not been named because he is a minor is alleged to have entered a massage parlour in downtown toronto in february brandishing a machete  he is alleged to have killed ashley noell arzaga a 24yearold mother injuring the owner as she tried to subdue him  police initially charged the suspect with first degree and attempted murder but on tuesday those charges were upgraded to “murder – terrorist activity”  the suspect appeared in court via video link on tuesday as prosecutors updated the charges  federal authorities started investigating the case after toronto police discovered evidence of “terrorist activity” tying the suspect to the socalled “incel” movement  incels – virtually all of whom are male – are selfdescribed “involuntary celibates” who subscribe to an ideology that the world is unjustly stacked against unattractive heterosexual men  in recent years a spike in killings in canada and the united states associated with the moment have led to greater scrutiny from law enforcement and security experts  the use of terrorism charges against the minor – probably the first for an act of violence not tied to islamic extremism – indicates the federal government views the movement as a growing threat in canada  authorities have so far been wary of deploying terrorismrelated charges in similar cases – even in the case of alek minassian the toronto man who killed 10 pedestrians and wounded 14 others when he plowed a delivery van on to a crowded sidewalk  ‘hate is infectious’ how the 1989 mass shooting of 14 women echoes today read more  after his arrest minassian told police officers that he was virgin who had never had a girlfriend admitted to using the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks asked how he felt about the death of 10 people he replied “i feel like i accomplished my mission”  minassian told his interrogators that he had been “radicalized” online and began to fantasize about starting his own “rebellion”  “i was thinking that i would inspire future masses to join me in my uprising as well” he said  minassian was due to appear in court in early april but fears of the coronavirus have delayed numerous trials

483,lockdowns trigger dramatic fall in global carbon emissions,carbon dioxide emissions have fallen dramatically since lockdowns were imposed around the world due to the coronavirus crisis research has shown  daily emissions of the greenhouse gas plunged 17 by early april compared with 2019 levels according to the first definitive study of global carbon output this year  the findings show the world has experienced the sharpest drop in carbon output since records began with large sections of the global economy brought to a near standstill when the lockdown was at its most stringent in some countries emissions fell by just over a quarter 26 on average in the uk the decline was about 31 while in australia emissions fell 283 for a period during april  “this is a really big fall but at the same time 83 of global emissions are left which shows how difficult it is to reduce emissions with changes in behaviour” said corinne le quéré a professor of climate change at the university of east anglia and lead author of the study published in the journal nature climate change “and it is not desirable – this is not the way to tackle climate change”  the unprecedented fall is likely to be only temporary as countries slowly get back to normal activity over the course of the year the annual decline is likely to be only about 7 if some restrictions to halt the virus remain in place however if they are lifted in midjune the fall for the year is likely to be only 4  that would still represent the biggest annual drop in emissions since the second world war and a stark difference compared with recent trends as emissions have been rising by about 1 annually but it would make “a negligible impact on the paris agreement” goals le quéré said  emissions must fall to net zero by midcentury or soon after to meet the goals of the paris agreement and keep global heating from reaching catastrophic levels according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change the fall in carbon resulting from the covid19 crisis reveals how far the world still has to go said le quéré  coronavirus world map which countries have the most cases and deaths read more  the experience of the crisis so far has shown that changes in behaviour by individuals – such as not flying working from home and driving less – can only go part of the way needed to cut emissions as even the lockdown measures left the bulk of emission sources intact she said adding that bigger shifts are needed to the way people produce and use energy  “just behavioural change is not enough” she said “we need structural changes to the economy and industry but if we take this opportunity to put structural changes in place we have now seen what it is possible to achieve”  emissions from aviation showed a dramatic decline of about 60 as international flights between many countries were grounded emissions from surface transport fell less sharply by about 36 power generation and industry accounted for about 86 of the total decline in emissions  despite such an unprecedented fall the impacts on the climate are likely to be small stocks of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which reached 4148 parts per million last year will rise further towards the danger threshold of 450ppm this year though perhaps at a slightly slower pace  “carbon dioxide stays in the air a long time so although emissions are smaller they are still happening and so carbon dioxide is still building up just a little more slowly” said richard betts the head of climate impacts research at the met office hadley centre who was not involved in the paper “if we want to halt the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere we need to stop putting it there altogether it’s like we’re filling a bath and have turned down the tap slightly but not turned it off”  the lockdowns have caused steep falls in energy demand but energy production has hardly been changed by the crisis noted mark maslin a professor of climatology at university college london who was also not involved in the paper  “the real lesson of this pandemic is that we must globally shift our energy production away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible if we are to ensure sustained yearonyear cuts to our global emissions” he said “the good news is that both of these will help to maintain the clean air and clear skies we have all rediscovered during lockdown saving many lives”  the comprehensive analysis was conducted by scientists from the university of east anglia stanford university in the us the cicero centre in norway as well as scientists in the netherlands australia france and germany  the researchers used measurements of economic activity energy generation industrial production transport and other proxies to estimate carbon dioxide output they concentrated their analysis on six areas power generation surface transport industry public buildings and commerce residential sources and aviation estimates were taken from 69 countries 50 us states and 30 chinese provinces representing 97 of global carbon emissions  although the rising concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere are regularly measured they are subject to large natural fluctuations so are unsuitable to the kind of snapshot analysis required to observe what is happening to global carbon output over a relatively short period

490,gillian anderson on a streetcar named desire i was hanging on to reality by a thread,a streetcar named desire is often seen as a play about sexuality but the young vic production draws our eye to the sibling bond between blanche dubois and her sister stella was there a focus on the sisters  i felt like i knew the play inside out until i started working on this production which peels away the onion layers on all the relationships between its characters firstly there’s something absolutely extraordinary about the complexity of williams’s drama which has so many layers benedict andrews who was the most fantastic director for this got it on a deep cellular level and created a platform where you could just keep ploughing through and investing in the joy and complexity of it  out of that came a whole new level between the sisters – not only the competition and jealousy between them but the guilt love shame and a gamut of other emotions sex came into both their lives at an early age – what was expected of them what they were used for and the discovery that their sexuality was their currency blanche uses it to the nth degree but it is also stella’s currency  magda willi’s set is designed on a revolving stage and the drama never stops moving what was the idea behind this perpetual movement  the movement starts when blanche takes her first sip of alcohol on stage to calm her nerves the minute she takes the sip the stage is moving she feels it and the audience feels it too it starts the real action and becomes a merrygoround that none of them can get off even at the end when blanche is taken away the stage continues to go round because stella is still trapped in the system  technically we understood that it would almost be like watching a film through a lens so that the audience could sometimes only hear our words and not see us and at other times be close up as we came closer towards them which added something powerful to watching it  what effect did the revolving stage have on your performance  at the beginning we were all really dizzy until we acclimatised there are times when blanche wears sixinch heels and at a certain point i had to see a chiropractor because i stepped off and yanked my hip and in a new york show vanessa kirby who plays stella got her leg caught in the revolve  facebook twitter pinterest trapped … vanessa kirby gillian anderson and ben foster in a streetcar named desire photograph tristram kentonthe guardian  what’s the biggest difference between playing a character on stage and on screen  when you’re creating a character for tv or film you’re not playing it 247 with a play you are doing it over and over and over again and this play got right into my gut when i performed it in new york i was either in my airbnb or on stage for the entire time part of that was about holding the character alive but it left me in a vulnerable state going into a corner shop to buy milk when you are blanche dubois is hard i felt like all the layers of my skin had come off you need to immerse yourself in a mental state to make the character truthful on stage and i don’t think i have ever immersed myself so deeply there were moments when i felt i was hanging on to reality by a thread and i needed to talk to people to ground myself so i wouldn’t disappear into the ether i’m not sure i would have the stamina to do it again  benedict andrews said something time and again that the play had elements of danger addiction guilt and sorrow which could be imagined like a shark swimming under the water every now and again the shark would come up expose its fin and be gone again we wanted the audience to know the shark was there that collective feeling is part of the experience of theatre and it’s why theatres are so vital these nt productions online are a way for theatre to stay alive but they are also a reminder that in order for theatres to open again they will need financial support and any help they can get in donations  how do you prepare for a role like blanche dubois – or your stage role last year as margo channing in all about eve – which have been made so iconic on film  it’s important not to watch anything remotely connected in the leadup to a part you don’t want to go in with preconceptions or any part of your mind relying on something with both blanche and margo it was important for me to go in with a blank slate i wanted to start from scratch you want your own interpretation but also you don’t know what vision the director will come in  i watched the film with vivien leigh when i was in college and then i made a point of watching it after i had finished playing blanche i thought leigh’s blanche was very vulnerable lost and weak in a way my blanche is vulnerable in a different way she comes with a lot of gusto and oomph  gillian anderson in a streetcar named desire – in pictures read more  how tricky were the quick costume changes which take place on stage  some days i couldn’t find my shoes some days i couldn’t do up the zip on the back of a pink dress that i pick up from the floor which blanche puts on in a drunken state i would be doing my monologue while holding the zip up with one hand halfway through the production we had to make a double of the dress because it was so ratty and had mopped up everything that had been thrown on the floor it was covered in potatoes and gravy and gunk in one performance its crinoline got caught in the leg of a chair and i was dragging the chair around with blanche yelling that somebody was after her and it added to the intensity of the moment the only way through it is to use it in the scene and keep going  you have said you’d always wanted to play blanche dubois is there another character you are burning to play  i had wanted to play her since i was 16 so she lived inside me for a very long time i was determined to play her and 30 years later at the age of 46 i did she really was the only one since doing her i’ve been trying to find other characters and productions that are as interesting and deep i’d like to do lady macbeth in the right production  you filmed a short prequel to streetcar entitled the departure and mentioned the possibility of a sequel too in 2015 is that something you are still considering  i did and it would be interesting but the question is how i would see blanche after the final scene in the play we don’t know what happens to her after she is led away by a doctor and nurse and i think it’s important that it hangs there for some people it might be important to imagine that she finally goes somewhere she feels safe and others might think it’s all downhill from there and she ends up growing old hearing imaginary voices in an institution
491,can virtual reality help get you through lockdown,from global exploration or robot warfare to virtual family gettogethers a vr headset could offer an alternative to going out  right now it feels as if there is no escape we’re stuck at home for most of the day our only respite coming from the odd stroll around the block  but make a list of the things you miss most from your prelockdown life and chances are you can probably do some form of them in virtual reality from travelling abroad to exercising outside and even visiting friends it’s all possible if you’re willing to strap on a headset  consumer vr technology although still not perfect has improved a lot in the past couple of years the most advanced headsets are the htc vive or its more livingroomfriendly variant cosmos from £500 valve index £920 and oculus rift s £400 all of which boast very high definition displays extraordinary responsiveness and intricate controller tracking – but they’re expensive quite complicated to set up and they need to be attached via cables to a highend pc  there are alternatives playstation vr £260 plugs into a ps4 console and provides a decent though comparatively low resolution experience with a really vast range of games including platformer astro bot rescue mission and epic space exploration sim no man’s sky  facebook twitter pinterest explore space or climb a mountain while your partner is watching tv  oculus quest an allinone headset with wireless controllers photograph facebookreuters  our favourite though is the oculus quest from £400 a powerful standalone headset that requires no connection to a pc and feels as comfortable and unintrusive as the tech currently gets it comes with two wireless controllers that track your arm movements accurately and the setup process is intuitive you simply use the controllers to draw out the usable space in your living room and an external camera makes sure you don’t get carried away and trip over your coffee table  apps such as altspacevr have let me meet strangers with weird avatars in virtual hangouts – as unsettling as it sounds  being freed from a bulky pc opens up the possibilities of vr as a casual home entertainment option it means you can sit on your sofa or in bed and explore space or climb a mountain while your partner is watching tv over the past fortnight i’ve been happily trawling youtube

weird avatars in virtual hangouts which has been as unsettling as it sounds  recently i may have taken my interest in vr technology a bit far by accepting a roto vr chair on loan from british tech startup roto vr it looks like a sports car seat mounted on a circular plinth but it comes with an ingenious headtracking device that you attach to your vr headset so that the chair rotates in the direction you’re looking  at first the movement is rather unsettling but as you get used to it it adds a rather wonderful sense of being physically present in a world which is perfect for virtual tourism apps as well as multidirectional games such as robo recall the headtracking rotation is also meant to cut down on vr motion sickness because it reduces the disparity between the screened activity and our body’s sense of where it is and what it’s doing there are also foot pedals to control forward and backward movement although few games currently support this feature it’s expensive at 999 £800 – roto vr says most of its preorders have been from universities businesses and arcades – but perhaps if the lockdown goes on much longer many more living rooms will have one  even without a

496,how to conduct a remote interview seven tips for schools hiring teachers,make sure you choose a quiet space to conduct an online interview photograph filadendrongetty images  as a result of the covid19 pandemic more schools than ever are recruiting new teachers online how can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process this handy sevenpoint guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom the teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their abcs from their hypotenuses – but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview  1 prepare your questions – and answers  an online interview is like any other – make sure you’ve set your interview agenda if you’re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you’ve decided who will ask what questions – and also who will answer any questions from your candidates key questions you should be prepared to answer would include what makes the school unique what does the school need to improve does the school provide personalised professional development how would pupils parents and other teachers describe your school and be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process  2 find a quiet space  when you’re conducting the interview make sure you’re in a quiet space with a background that is tidy and clear it’s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards simple stuff i know but you’d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning it could make the difference in a successful appointment  3 ensure your technology is up to date  it’s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you’ve got a reliable broadband connection check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call it’s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between zoom skype google hangouts or microsoft teams  4 prepare to multitask  learn how to speak to the camera lens make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera the screen and the microphone when you are not speaking for example you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises if you take time to rehearse this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down  5 offer to let candidates speak to colleagues  once you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school select a range of teachers who best represent your school to show your potential as a good employer for example a member of the support staff the school receptionist a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school you’re looking to give an indication of the school’s culture this may be difficult to achieve remotely but it’s not impossible plan to have this in place now  facebook twitter pinterest try and involve pupils either with a pupil interview or an online lesson photograph richard drurygetty images  6 offer a pupil interview if possible  technology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process if you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online it’s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise of course during a pandemic going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching facetoface watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom how do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens can they question hold to account and provide feedback to pupils online  the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview read more  7 can you offer a virtual tour  one of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school doing this remotely presents a significant challenge but again those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve beyond the school website most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site with photo galleries and online videos it’s worth making sure your school’s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public as well as pupils and parents and prospective teachers with most schools open during covid19 in a limited capacity there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently onsite to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities classrooms and office spaces this will allow potential candidates to ask questions or gain a perception of potential employment opportunities  appointing teachers during a pandemic is difficult but it’s not impossible to ensure your school isn’t missing key appointments when all schools resume full service it is critical that your school considers remote recruitment ideas now  if you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to

497,the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview,recruiters say that both the interviewer and candidate should treat a remote interview like a traditional facetoface interview photograph cavan imagesgetty imagescavan images rf  candidates in their dressing gowns dogs and children running about partners in the background watching tv or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector david stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews “when people are working at home because it’s your personal space a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting” stone the founder of mrl consulting group says “it’s amazing what you see going on in the background”  holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept particularly for companies that have built remote international teams nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process with an influx of artificialintelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years there are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice facial expressions and speech patterns during video preassessments scoring them against an ideal profile for that role graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems  but for many companies still recruiting during the global covid19 lockdown moving the process online can be a daunting prospect stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional facetoface meeting as much as possible “get up get showered put a suit on” he says “pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet” some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person he adds “you’ve got to try and get past that build rapport put them at their ease get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax”  ellie wilson the cofounder and operations director of virtalent has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago she’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online “we can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours” she says “i certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand i ask the same questions to a candidate that i would if they were sitting right in front of me for me nothing changes – i try to extract the information that i need to be assured that this is the right person for the job can i see this person working with us working with our clients do they give me confidence”  while recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process that doesn’t have to be via a bespoke hr platform – video conference tools such as zoom skype and microsoft teams work just as well “if they’re going to be working remotely you also need to be reassured they have the right setup at home” she adds “i check that they have a dedicated desk area they have an appropriate seat and it looks free from distraction”  facebook twitter pinterest recruiters may use a video interview to check that candidates have suitable workspace at home photograph drazengetty images  candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand think about getting the lighting and camera angle right test microphones and put phones and any push notifications on silent says flexible working consultant and executive coach marilyn devonish “when speaking look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them” she adds rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen zoom has a “hide myself” option which can help she recommends interviewees also do a practice runthrough with friends or family “think about making sure your personality comes out so if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated selfstarter that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera” candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge  looking to teach at a new school here’s how to find the one that’s right for you read more  recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying “things like saying ‘right’ ‘ok’ ‘great’” devonish adds “if the sound drops this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say ‘i’m sorry i missed that’ both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly” a clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time including the necessary passwords and access links and always have a plan b “let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails they can call you and if something does go wrong watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure”  stone believes the covid19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward “this episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur” he says “we’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too just having a laptop delivered to their house they’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives”  if you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiterstheguardiancom and if you are seeking a new role at a school

498,teacher training how do you prepare to teach a new class during lockdown,it’s important when teaching remotely to make sure that every student is treated as an individual photograph damircudicgetty images  if you are a teacher looking to move between schools during the coronavirus lockdown how can you make the most of the online education experience with your new class this is interesting new territory for many teachers but there are thousands and thousands of teachers and pupils already learning remotely in virtual schools – can they offer insights  at a virtual school lessons are delivered in line with each person’s personalised curriculum exactly as you would expect in a physical school space pupils are taught how to interact with teachers their peers and lesson content using whiteboard technology quizzes voice and video as well as receiving and sending assignment tasks how should you introduce yourself to a new class if you are meeting them online for the first time if we consider how teachers deliver excellent classroom teaching practice in a physical space how they prepare should not be approached any differently in an online environment  flipped learning  “flipped learning” is a term used to describe how teachers can provide material for pupils to learn outside of the classroom although this is traditionally considered homework or coursework and typically completed without the teacher increasingly this approach to enhance learning outside of the classroom has been set and completed online during lockdown teachers will be focusing on core curriculum content meeting the needs of vulnerable pupils as well as enhancing student engagement mixing between activities types of assignments and differentiation techniques to support a range of pupils one factor that must be considered for teachers who are working remotely is how they can mix online teaching and learning with traditional methods that would be used in the physical classroom a good tip for teachers working online especially from home is to have a simple whiteboard behind the camera and teach just as you would in a physical classroom space doing this over a sustained period of time will definitely present a new challenge but it’s possible with wellthoughtout curriculum plans and a simple range of equipment  blended learning  blended learning first developed in the 1960s was a method of instruction using technologymediated methods with flipped learning being the norm during lockdown what can teachers learn from other educators who are already working in blended learning environments – teachers working in virtual schools or online tutors  if we look towards barak rosenshine’s 17 recommendations for effective teaching these can quite easily be reapplied to online teaching delivered through at least video conferencing at the start of every lesson review the last lesson with a simple retrieval exercise this supports longterm retention can easily be deployed with a simple quiz or competition and is a guaranteed way to get a lesson off to a flying start  when presenting new material successful teachers teach by giving a series of short presentations using many examples teachers should also provide guided practice by modelling various techniques where teachers present too much material at once this will confuse pupils working online without sufficient verbal and nonverbal cues means it will be critical for teachers to regularly check student responses  one way that teachers can do this is to ask a large number of questions feedback can be provided by giving prompts modelling and guiding pupils as they develop independent practice and asking simple questions such as “who where why and how” to help shape pupils’ thinking when teachers check frequently to see if all students are learning this processes information into longterm memory developing schematic concepts to support retention teaching remotely whether using microsoft teams google suite or other platforms gives teachers a significant array of strategies to deploy at this interesting time  finally research recommends that teachers should try “scaffold learning” helping pupils to problemsolve by thinking out loud and providing cognitive support this can be achieved by completing the work alongside pupils doing this online may require teachers to use “breakout spaces” by waiting to provide individual feedback in live video conferencing lessons  facebook twitter pinterest teachers delivering lessons from home should have a simple whiteboard behind them and teach just as they would in a physical classroom photograph jovanmandicgetty imagesistockphoto  flexibility and personalisation  every student should be treated as an individual online as all teachers would in a physical space and with teachers working remotely they will need to learn how to use technology as well as adapt content to meet individual needs if you are meeting your pupils for the first time i would recommend sending them a survey asking them to complete simple questions so that you can elicit initial information about their interests abilities and hopes you can then start to plan which interventions you will use in your lesson planning and delivery  to help support increased teacher workload my key recommendation would be that if teachers are able to connect with the pupils online it is important to allow students to engage in a weekly and monthly review of their learning to support longterm memory often this manifests itself when a pupil says “we’ve done this before” but effective teachers will remind pupils that this is a retrieval practice exercise to assist with longterm retention  safeguarding and security  if you are joining a virtual school then i would assume the various safeguarding procedures are already in place however if you now find yourself teaching pupils online for the first time having never met them physically you should doublecheck to ensure that your new school has considered data protection child protection internet security and the various online safeguarding procedures for teachers and pupils  how to conduct a remote interview seven tips for schools hiring teachers read more  when teaching from your own home environment it is worth reflecting on your own safeguarding procedures for example if you have not yet physically reached your new school have you received any induction or has the designated safeguarding officer spoken with you about induction procedures of the students in your register which have specific learning needs that require initial conversations with your special needs coordinator or associated form tutors all these balances and checks would be done physically on entry to a new school just because you are doing this remotely doesn’t mean that they should not happen  creating a supportive online environment  what should teachers consider when meeting their pupils online many schools will assign homelearning tasks through software or an online curriculum portal which parents can access other schools will have their teachers and pupils log on to a secure platform to complete assignments submit work and interact with the teacher through voice or text some schools will be offering live video lessons with pupils teaching from the home environment or from their school classrooms  if we look towards countries such as south korea and singapore where teachers have an almost celebritylike online presence it’s common to find them sharing videos teaching lessons through youtube or having millions of viewers on instagram  if you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiterstheguardiancom and if you are seeking a new role at a

remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years independent and english language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via
