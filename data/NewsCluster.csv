2,The speech Modi has not made but should,"Beloved brothers and sisters,  We have been struck by the worst tragedy since Independence. We shall overcome, with courage and resilience. But we must also change course in the light of experience.  Colleagues and experts advised me to announce a Rs 20 lakh crore package spread over every possible vote bank. I was sceptical. For instance, providing Rs 3,500 crore for the relief of migrant workers sounded good, yet meant just Rs 250 each for 14 crore migrant workers, half the minimum daily wage in major cities. All the new financial measures will not prevent bank bad debts from doubling.  I was advised to finance the package through the RBI, banks, concessions and promises, not budgetary borrowing. Experts said our fiscal situation was perilous, and rating agencies might downgrade India to junk status if it announced a big fiscal rescue. Advisors also suggested gradual re-opening of the economy, keeping hot spots mostly shut.  After much thought, I have rejected this approach. Let us be strong and not dictated to by rating agencies, especially since other emerging markets are far worse off. The foreign direct investment we seek is not driven by credit ratings. So, I have decided to boldly expand the fiscal deficit by 5% of GDP to help needy people and enterprises. RBI will print the required sums.  Many measures suggested by my advisors are sensible. Others are just spin, reflect decisions already announced or expand ongoing schemes. That’s okay, good politics tries to raise morale at minimal fiscal cost.  The fundamental problem is that we are being ravaged not so much by Covid as our own lockdowns. The cure is proving worse than the disease. Lockdowns are killing enterprises, livelihoods and people on a massive scale. By contrast, Covid deaths are under 3,000, against 80,000 in the USA.  Alas, this is not because we are world leaders in prevention or containment. Millions of households sleep four or more people per room, making isolation and social distancing difficult. Our low fatality rate may reflect resistance got from dozens of other rampant diseases, from TB and flu to measles and pertussis. Maybe we get resistance from high temperatures, or from the most polluted air and water in the world.  Bottom line: fatality numbers today make Covid look only a modest health risk. Yet to combat it, we have imposed terrible misery through draconian shutdowns. Ten million Indians die every year of various causes. TB alone claims 450,000. We do not respond by locking down the economy: we learn to live with the diseases.  Covid was initially feared to be as infectious as the Spanish flu of 2018 that killed millions. But today, India’s Covid fatality rate is peanuts. This may partly reflect incomplete data, partly the lockdown’s effect. But maybe we have also been guilty of panicky over-reaction to a not-so-deadly virus.  Every death is a tragedy, but a Covid death is not more tragic than a TB or influenza death. Since we live with those, why not with Covid too? Soumya Swaminathan of the World Health Organisation warns that we may have no choice: we may never have a fully effective vaccine for Covid, as is true of HIV and influenza. We may ultimately have to live with all these diseases.  Critics say that other developing countries have announced a bigger stimulus up to 20% of GDP. This is misleading. Despite additional government spending, the GDP of these countries is crashing, so they are more sedated than stimulated. Lesson: the biggest and only sustainable stimulus is to get the economy to boom again, and that means phasing out lockdowns.  This will carry risks of Covid spreading. But in any case, it will eventually spread till we get ‘herd immunity’. Our policy of lockdowns in red zones is not working. The number of red zones seems to be expanding fast — from 130 to 180 districts that create two-thirds of GDP — and the answer cannot be to keep extending lockdowns. We must revive economic growth.  Let us shift focus from lockdowns that hurt a billion people to massive testing, tracing and isolating Covid-infected people. This will require a major change of mindset and administrative effort. In our crowded conditions, I fear we will meet only with partial success. But when no ideal solutions exist, let us shift from seriously flawed lockdowns to less flawed measures.  Beloved brothers and sisters, a great calamity has laid low all countries, even the mightiest. Let us not worsen that calamity through panicky over-reaction that is costlier than the disease. Changing course entails sacrifices. But deep in my heart, I do believe that we shall overcome some day."
3,"In an increasingly selfish world, self-reliance is the only route for India","The Great War of 1914-18 that led to more than 20 million deaths, changed international politics unrecognisably and triggered another, more horrible World War 21 years later, began with the brinkmanship of great powers going awry. However, when it began in August 1914 with jingoistic fanfare all over Europe, few people anticipated its devastating magnitude. Indeed, the conventional wisdom was that the boys would be home for Christmas.  History may or may not repeat itself this year. The global war against what Boris Johnson described as the “devilish illness” may be another transformative moment. Alternatively, it could be — to borrow historian A J P Taylor’s phrase — another “turning point” when “history refused to turn”.  The signs, alas, are ominous. Last Thursday, WHO dashed hopes of life returning to pre-March 25 normal when it announced that Covid-19 “may just become another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away.” Unless some scientist stumbles into discovering a wonder vaccine, the world is destined to live with a permanent uncertainty of infection and, possibly, premature death. Just when human endeavour seemed to have pierced the frontiers of knowledge, the virus from Wuhan has stepped in to invoke the pre-modern fear of the unknown.  Whether PM Narendra Modi had been alerted to WHO’s admission of failure before his address on May 12 is unknown. His passing reference to having to live with the pandemic may suggest he was. What is, however, clear is that rather than joining in the dejection that this global setback is likely to produce — the WHO has already warned of the grave impact on the “mental health and wellbeing of whole societies” — he has chosen to plan for India’s future in the corona-infested world. His prescriptions may not be gospel and adjustments will possibly have to be made to cope with newer challenges. But at a moment when people are grappling for direction and both hope reassurance and hope, he has at least come out with a mission statement of the road ahead. In wartime, people expect decisive leadership. Modi has risen to the occasion.  At the heart of his approach is a belief that India has the resolve and resilience to cope with the disruption the pandemic is certain to create. The prolonged lockdown has led to enormous hardships and even trauma, particularly for those who were left stranded and jobless. However, considering the sheer scale of the exercise and that it had to be undertaken in extreme haste, the compliance has been awesome. True, there have been cases of truant behaviour — West Bengal is a sad example — but overall India’s record of 2,760 deaths and 86,678 infections (as of May 16) is worthy of appreciation. Sceptics in the West have been disabused of their fear that India will see a replay of the mass deaths that characterised famines of yesteryears. Of course, this can still happen if people lower their guard after May 18.  Secondly, stemming from this belief that India can rise to the challenge is the assumption that in the coming days the world will become incredibly selfish. America has eschewed its global role; Europe is pulling in conflicting directions; and China’s power is laced with menacing connotations. The vision of a globalised world has crashed. Even the opportunities for Indians in West Asia are certain to shrink dramatically, affecting remittances.  In such a situation, there is no alternative to India bolstering its own capacity and aiming for maximum self-reliance. This is not a prescription for insularity, but a process of pragmatic adjustment based on the conviction that India’s future cannot be based on either someone else’s benevolence or abject subordination. Yes, Modi’s prescription is unabashedly nationalistic and technocentric. There are obvious parallels with Japan, but minus the aggressive militarism that marred its pre-1945 enterprise. India’s outreach has to be visibly benign and based on soft power.  The challenges before India in this uncertain world are daunting and they must be navigated with caution and nimbleness. But the real challenge is internal. To achieve his objective or even come close to achieving it, Modi has to first motivate Indians into believing in themselves. This involves shedding the culture of sloth, ossified thinking, red tape and negativism that, unfortunately, has prevented India from realising its full potential. The challenge is economic, human and intellectual. It is not enough to invite the world to Make in India; there has to be a corresponding pride in the excellence of Made in India."
4,A letter of apology to the migrants who made our homes & highways,"Dear Jamlo Makdam,  This letter of apology will never reach you. You perished last month. You were walking from a Telangana chilli farm to your home in a Chhattisgarh village. Your 12-year-old exhausted legs could not carry you for all those hundreds of kilometres in the scorching sun.  Yours is not the only tragedy. A database — Thejesh GN — shows that until May 11, while walking thousands of kilometres towards home, 29 have died of exhaustion and 83 have died in accidents on the road. This week, 17 died in 24 hours, hit by speeding trucks on the highway. In Aurangabad, train tracks have turned red with blood — 16 weary workers, walking from Maharashtra towards Madhya Pradesh, lay down to doze off on the tracks. The people felt the elevation of the tracks would protect them from wild animals but were cut down by a goods train. With public transport cruelly shut off, workers even piled into an airless concrete mixer to travel some distance towards home.  We, the so-called urban middle class, the prosperous, the educated, have collectively failed you. We are the beneficiaries of the new economy, we are the aspirational Indians, we love our malls, our penthouses, our swimming pools. You built all of these, yet we could not see you. You were invisible to us, hidden away behind the metallic jungle of scaffolding. Today you walk on the six-lane highways you built for our SUVs.  We see the bewildered pain in your eyes. It makes us realise that however much charity we throw at you, make you line up for food packets or herd you into camps, we can never make up for the fact that all of us — politicians and civil society alike — have snatched away the most fundamental of all democratic rights: your self-respect, your dignity. As skilled breadwinners, asking for food is terrible humiliation.  You built our houses, but we never asked that you get low-cost housing. We have never demanded that you get any form of social security. As we gazed out of our skyscrapers at the slums outside, we wanted to blank you out and pretend you weren’t there. We wanted slums to be demolished, or to build walls between us and you.  What did we argue in our defence? We have no powers, what can the helpless middle class do, given the scale of the deprivation? It’s the state and the politician, surely, who must be the provider.  But sadly, most politicians couldn’t care less. Politicians have always seen you as a vote bank, regularising slum colonies only before elections but making little effort to provide basic amenities.  Promises of Swachh Bharat were made, but the website Indiaspend records that in 2015-16, 10% of urban households mostly in slum colonies, still practised open defecation because of lack of access to functioning toilets.  If the politicians ignored you, so did civil society. Yes, workers who were earlier called “maidservants” are now called “domestic help”, but the change in nomenclature has hardly resulted in a change in mindset. Across middle-class India, the relationship with domestic workers continues to be exploitative and transactional. RWAs have attempted to stop domestic helps from coming to work as they fear they are corona carriers, ignoring the fact that most of those who carry the virus are those who have travelled abroad.  We speak imperiously of social distancing, but such measures are meaningless for families living in 6×8 feet tenements. For many of “us”, the lockdown is almost an elite privilege: we can catch up on Netflix shows and learn new hobbies. Today the international buzzword is work from home (WFH), but for you the construction site was your home. You lived in dark, dingy, temporary basements while building gleaming mansions. What does WFH mean to you?  Sooner or later the lockdown will end and workers from villages will once again stream back to the city. Will they be condemned to the same lives living without proper shelter or security? Surely, it’s time for a new contract between “you” and “us”, for a new relationship, a new way of looking at each other. There can be no going back.  You cannot go back to being simply statistics without faces or names. Greater institutional protection is an urgent necessity. It’s time “we” recognise your legal constitutional status as citizens equal to “us”, in no way lesser, however ragged your clothes.  Perhaps that would be the best way to remember you, Jamlo Makdam, and to seek your forgiveness. You, the lonely 12-year-old, who died walking hundreds of kilometres to somehow reach your mother."
5,"We don’t have to defeat Covid, we need to make peace with it","Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally told the nation something that would have been good to hear a month or more back.  He said “Friends, experts and scientists have pointed out that corona will remain a part of our lives for a long time. But at the same time, we cannot allow our lives to only be confined to corona. We should wear masks, follow social distancing and pursue our goals.”  Unfortunately, until this point we have treated corona as an enemy that had to be defeated, drummed out of India, its tail between its legs. When Mr Modi asked Indians to bang pots and pans to thank doctors and medical staff fighting against corona, his more ardent supporters claimed the sound waves would dispel the virus. When the Prime Minister asked us to light diyas for 9 minutes from 9pm, a slew of WhatsApp messages insisted that thanks to the heat generated corona would die at 9.09pm that Sunday. There have been many Sundays since then. Covid-19 is very much around and the Prime Minister is talking about Lockdown IV.  Of course deep down we all knew the virus would not obey our lockdown calendar. The lockdown was not a silver bullet. It bought medical facilities time. It allowed India to ramp up on its supplies of PPE kits and N95 masks. But it was a wasted opportunity in terms of teaching us how to live in a post-lockdown world where Covid-19 would still be a reality, undeterred by the sound and light show of the bartan orchestra and candlelight vigils. “In these flu-like epidemics there is a huge wave and then it lingers on for years together,” says Dr Pratima Murthy, head of psychiatry at NIMHANS. “So I think we need to adjust to a life where we manage ourselves in a sensible manner but we go about our work.” That messaging that would have gone a long way in reassuring an anxious citizenry that it is possible to navigate a normal world where we get our root canals done and our plumbing fixed and meet a friend despite Covid. And a Covid diagnosis should not mean neighbourhood panic and instant stigma.  Rarely has a government had our collective attention as completely as it did during the long weeks of this lockdown. If Indians had emerged from the lockdown knowing how to wear and wash a mask properly that would have been time well-spent. If we had been given clear messaging about how to sanitise vegetables we bought at the bazaar that would have been useful. If we had been taught a basic “sanitisation drill” to follow when we return from work that would have been reassuring. A lot of our anxiety around Covid-19 stems from the fact that we do not understand what we need to do to keep our families safe. We are petrified that we will inadvertently bring the virus home in a post-lockdown world. And while politicians talk about defeating the virus, the rest of us are scouring survival tips from WhatsApp University. Someone is sunning their newspapers all day. Someone is scrubbing vegetables with Vim bars. Someone is spraying eau de cologne on currency notes. Someone is swearing by gaumutra as a Covid-blocker. And then there are thousands of Indians crammed in the back of trucks, just trying to get back home, handkerchiefs around their faces — a threadbare defense against a virulent pandemic.  This could have been the time for the government to try and get out messaging that answered these questions, lessened the stigma around those testing positive or at least kicked off these conversations. Instead we rained flower petals from fighter jets. Now Covid looms beyond the lockdown like the undead.  The tragedy is that in an era of strongmen leaders around the world, we only seem to understand a war metaphor when it comes to confronting great challenges. But Covid-19 is not Pakistan, an old enemy to be vanquished. We might want to think of a pandemic as a World War but there will be no Treaty of Versailles that will mark the end of the lockdown. One day hopefully there will be a vaccine or herd immunity. But WHO emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan warns that the virus “may never go away” just as measles persists despite a vaccine. “HIV has not gone away — but we have come to terms with the virus,” he says. We don’t have to win the war against Covid as much as we need to learn to make peace with its existence in our world for now. It might help to remember what Leo Tolstoy wrote: “The strongest of all warriors are these two — Time and Patience.” The name of the book? War and Peace."
6,"Decoding economic revival package: Factoring in limited fiscal space, it bets on enhanced credit flows as a trigger","In order to get a feel of the contours of the government’s Rs 20 lakh crore revival package, it is useful to understand the circumstances in which it is being announced. First, with the most optimistic predictions pegging GDP growth at barely over 1% for 2020-21 – compared to 5% in the previous year – a stimulus is imperative. Second, with slow economic growth over the last couple of years pulling tax collections down, the government has limited “fiscal space”. This means it can’t prime the economic pump through a massive increase in spending or a cut in taxes.  Third, monetary policy is doing what it can to stave off a collapse by flooding the economy with cash. Since 27 March, the RBI has through different sluices released Rs 525,000 crore of liquidity into the financial system. Banks, however, fear a rise in defaults due to the economic downturn and are shying away from channelling this liquidity to sectors that need it the most. They prefer instead to park their money with the RBI itself resulting in “reverse repo balances” of over Rs 800,000 crore a day on average.  Fourth, the worst affected by the collapse in growth are the small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and India’s shadow banks or NBFCs that cater to their financial needs. While MSMEs are collectively one of the biggest employers with about 120 million workers on their rolls, they are also considered by banks to be the riskiest borrowers.  This is not because Covid has singled them out for punishment. MSMEs have been skating on thin ice since demonetisation in 2016 and the introduction of GST the following year. The implosion of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (ILFS) in mid 2018 dealt a body blow to the NBFCs from which they did not quite recover. Covid has simply made things worse.  Finally, the pandemic hurts both demand and supply. Locking down is a sledgehammer blow to supply chains and hence downstream final production. A collapse in supply affects in turn the capacity to earn incomes and hits demand hard. A worker who is laid off will focus on ensuring a bare subsistence; the entrepreneur saddled with a loss will put off his decision to buy a new car. Discretionary spending plummets.  Add to this the fact that households are known to ratchet their precautionary savings up and reduce consumption in the wake of crises and you get a situation in which even if supply were to get back on its feet, producers might not find buyers to sell to.  Shorn of the hype and hyperbole, the government’s revival strategy is an “optimal” response to the constraints that this complex mesh of circumstances imposes. To start with, the government hopes that enhanced credit flow can substitute for hard budgetary spending in providing the needed fillip. A large part of the stimulus is really about activating channels of credit. The Rs 300,000 crore collateral free loan facility for MSMEs or the Rs 30,000 crore liquidity facility for NBFCs, mortgage lenders and microfinance institutions announced in the first tranche of the package are examples.  Relying on credit helps in two ways. First, it enables the government to operate within the fiscal confines. Second, it can potentially revive supply by making more working capital (perhaps the most critical input for producers) available and at low interest rates. The bet is that as that supply resumes, it would set off a virtuous cycle. A revival in production would get workers back on payrolls; they would spend more pushing demand up in the process; more demand would call for more supply and so the cycle goes.  How does the government plan to enhance credit flow? After all the decisions to lend lie squarely with banks. The government’s tack is to reduce the risk of loans going bad by turning into a guarantor for borrowers. Thus, behind every effort to get banks to ramp up lending, there is a government backstop – a promise to make good a bank’s losses if a borrower defaults. Guarantees are strange creatures. They are “fiscal” in that the government provides it. Yet they do not involve immediate expenditures and thus no immediate increase to fiscal deficit. They are “contingent liabilities” that need to be paid in future were defaults to happen.  The final assumption in this strategy: while larger firms are better able to look after themselves, it is the MSMEs that need handholding. A large fraction of this credit targeting is thus to MSMEs and their financiers, the NBFCs. An implicit belief is that smaller firms are most likely to deliver economic salvation if they revive. For one they are big employers, and secondly they are indispensable to supply chains that keep the production ecosystem in good fettle.  Stripped to its bare bones, the government’s revival plan is logically consistent. Besides, the fact that other countries such as the US and UK are also placing huge bets on credit flow and guarantees to lift their economies gives it a degree of legitimacy. Critics are however not hard to find. They ask uncomfortable questions about whether the economy has the capacity to absorb so much credit or whether loans rather than conventional fiscal expansion is the right cure. “Parkalam” as the late Congress leader Kamaraj was fond of saying. Let’s see."
7,Reopen now: Kickstarting economy cannot be delayed any longer,"With Lockdown 3.0 on its last legs amid talk of future iterations with fewer controls, it should be left to state governments to decide how they proceed. The outbreak’s intensity and spread are manifesting differently in each state and wide sweeps from New Delhi’s vantage point must yield to decision making by state governments to remedy economic repercussions, closer as they are to ground realities. Freezing economic activity is no longer an option. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has proposed, rightly, that restrictions remain only in containment zones while other places, including markets, reopen.  Colour coded restrictions at district level are far too sweeping and restrictive for any meaningful economic activity to restart. Europe and the United States, despite greater resources, social security cushioning for economic distress and higher incidence of Covid-19 cases, are reopening faster than India after less stringent lockdowns. Neighbouring China made a strong statement throwing open a Disneyland in Shanghai. Meanwhile in India, migrants continue to trudge home on foot thanks to limited transport options.  Containment zones must be sharply defined and thus minimally disruptive for those not in immediate proximity, otherwise entire localities could find themselves locked in again as the Covid trajectory nears peaking point. An open letter from a group of internationally renowned scientists and doctors strongly urges the use of masks to reduce coronavirus transmission, warning that patients are most infectious in the pre-symptomatic stage. Despite masks becoming compulsory, perhaps the most simple workaround we have, people continue to violate the official directive. Governments must get cracking in this direction instead of bureaucratic hair splitting over essential and non-essential commodities/ services, or red, green and orange zones. Low on confidence and ridden by fear psychosis, businesses and citizens emerging from the lockdown will benefit from clear signalling. Eschew long, unwieldy sets of regulations in favour of a minimal number of physical distancing rules."
8,Beauty contest: Lipstick takes the backseat to mascara,"WFH means one can spend the whole day in slippers and pajamas, just keeping the lower body shy of the camera’s gaze during official meetings. This doesn’t work for everyone. Dressing up helps some women feel mentally more at work. But what does one do about the hair? Two months of lockdown mean it is sadly out of style and colour. DIY cuts are hit and miss.  On the upside many women are reporting big improvements in hair quality. Pollution is down. So are blow drying and flat ironing. But desi masks are seriously up. Eggs, olive oil, curd, honey, aloe vera, hibiscus flowers … the locks are getting some A grade conditioning. Skin is a similar story. For many ladies makeup has been the daily pick-me-up but it doesn’t seem worth the effort when they are not going out to meet the world. Skincare, however, can have a much more homely face. From the Japanese Tanaka facial massage to Ayurveda, education is only one click away. Some tender loving self care is a stressbuster. And it puts you in control.  The lipstick index has been used to describe the surge in cosmetic sales during past downturns. But Covid times are seeing the mascara index instead – because our mouths are masked and our eyes centrestage. And finally, even WFH needs sunscreen. Like John Donne wrote, the busy old fool, unruly sun, dost through windows and even through curtains call on us. Beware the wrinkles in its wake."
9,What government agencies can do to ensure safety and security of migrant workers,"Trust deficit among poor people has been quite visible during the Covid-19 outbreak. The painful visuals of helpless poor people going back to their hometowns and villages have raised questions about the government’s timeliness in providing adequate support to migrant workers. By the time the finance minister announced free food grains for the next two months to migrant workers who don’t have ration cards with a financial support of Rs 3,500 crore, most of the workers have either left or are leaving under distressed conditions.  Although government agencies kept promising safety and security of poor people in the cities, it took almost 50 days into the lockdown to announce this and other benefits. Looking at the sluggish implementation mechanism, translation of these packages into actual benefits can take even longer. Many migrant workers have left cities in the absence of food and cash flow into the household.  The government could have gained more trust of these poor folk by acting swiftly and extending confidence not by mere words, but by actually transferring cash into their bank accounts for four to five months and by delivering ration without much hassle. At this time of crisis, the government should have really tried the ‘self-declaration’ approach by poor people to access benefits rather than getting into bureaucratic glitches and doubting the credentials of poor migrant workers, as happened in cities like Delhi.  According to the 2011 Census India has 56 million inter-state migrants, of which 40 million live in urban areas. Of these roughly 34 million work in the informal sector. Roughly 79% of India’s migrants work for daily wages in factories or construction sites. Looking at the recent crisis, the government should seriously consider setting up an Inter-State Migration Council, which can work towards safety, security and welfare of the migrant workers. This council will be able to resolve issues related to inter-state migration.  According to government sources, cash benefits of about Rs 3,000 crore have been given to 2 crore registered construction workers. However, there is a huge discrepancy between actual number of construction workers versus registered workers who are getting benefits from the boards. For example, Delhi government has paid Rs 5,000 to about 40,000 registered workers but the city would have many unregistered construction workers. The registration process in existing boards is very cumbersome. The government must think of ‘self-declaration’ mechanism for all unorganised sector workers by which workers can register themselves easily. Such a mechanism can have provisions attracting punishment, in case of false declaration.  More than 90% of the workforce is active in the unorganised sector in India without any permanent work or social security. Most of them do not have identity proofs which can establish their work status. In 2014, the government had promised to register 47 crore unorganised workers and provide Aadhaar linked non-transferable UWIN (unorganised workers identity card) on the lines of the Gujarat government, but this hasn’t moved beyond a promise.  Availability of such cards can be beneficial for all migrant workers and the government could easily deliver benefits during a crisis. When the government can deliver Aadhaar card to establish unique identity of an individual, and the ‘One nation One ration card’ for ration, this is the right time for a ‘single portable card for workers’ in the informal sector to be initiated. This card can work as an identity card as well as benefit-cum-entitlement card for them.  Both in normal times and during a crisis situation like Covid-19, an organised mechanism to serve the interest of workers can not only regenerate confidence of workers in the system but also drastically improve labour governance in the country. With 38.4% contribution by the informal sector (excluding agriculture) to GDP, more targeted and inclusive policies for the workers here will bring better results for the economy.  If we do not take care of the welfare of migrant workers at the earliest, the pictures of their leaving the cities are going to haunt the country for a longer period. Originating states of migrant workers need to act swiftly by creating income opportunities for them, or else we might face a social upheaval in the coming months. The workers have shown their might by walking hundreds of miles. It’s time for governments and society to reciprocate."
10,Five lessons of Covid: Factors that are negative for India are having greater impact than mitigating ones,"Six months into the Covid pandemic, here are five lessons. The first is that it is lower levels of government, not central governments, that are the mainstays.Don’t look to Trump, Xi, Modi, Merkel, Johnson, Macron, Putin, Bolsonaro, Ramaphosa and Jokowi to wrestle Covid to the ground. In India, the heavy lifting is being done by chief ministers, state officials, municipalities, panchayats, districts, and block development officers. The central government advises, supports, and looks after the macroeconomy – and not much else. Give credit also to the moral economy of ordinary citizens – their local norms of sharing and caring in crises are vital.  A second lesson is stop expecting China and America to lead. China made a terrible mess of its initial response, withheld information, victimised its whistleblowers and continues to obfuscate. While it has recovered, the American response has been calamitous. This is hardly surprising given the inanities of Donald Trump. Leadership has come from small countries and territories – Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand and the Scandinavians (not Sweden). Note that all except Singapore and Thailand are led by women, not alpha males. Amongst bigger countries, Germany, South Korea, and Vietnam stand out.  The third lesson is that science does not know everything, but it knows a lot more than common sense and traditional medicine. In the end, it is science that will help pull us through, with symptomatic treatment, tracking, coordinating and communication technologies, social distancing and proper hygiene practices, and possibly a vaccine. ‘Possibly a vaccine’ because no one has successfully developed a vaccine for a coronavirus.  Fourth, we know what works: testing, social distancing, and hygiene. The most common way of getting Covid seems to be by touch. This is why hygiene, even more than distancing and masks, is vital. These practices buy medical teams time to handle the cases coming their way. That said, Covid will persist. There will be periodic outbreaks and lockdowns, as with Ebola or SARS.  Finally, India confronts a serious situation. Within days, India will have more cases than China. The flattening of the curve is nowhere in sight. The ‘R0’ number which should be less than one is estimated to be 1.4. India’s figures are an underestimate, in any case, as our tracking is weak, partly because testing is so low. The easing of the lockdown will only increase the spread. Easing the lockdown is inescapable, but levels of social distancing and hygiene are simply not good enough. At the current rate, by December, we could have a million cases.  All the factors that were thought to be mitigating for India have failed to protect us: the heat, lack of air conditioning,TB vaccinations and natural immunity. You could argue that Covid’s incidence would have been worse if these factors were not in play, but clearly they are not strong enough to bring the epidemic under control. This is because the factors that are negative for India are having greater impact: weak governance, shambolic healthcare, population density and poverty.  Given what looms, it is fanciful to think that India can take advantage of the opportunity that may exist with China’s downturn and any desire of investors to move out. If those investors go anywhere, it is to Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. In any case, China has gone back to work and has economic and governance strengths India cannot match. The Chinese economy could well come back even stronger, given that all other major economies are floundering. As for India’s ambition to be a “leading power” in this crisis, that is laughable. It needs to get Covid under control, and it must face up to the challenge ahead. It should stop posturing internationally when its own situation is dire. Real leadership is to look a problem in the eye."

However, if you choose to reconcile with your ex, there still could be some things that might not be the same:Many a time, after a raging fight with your friend or your sibling, you don’t feel like talking to each other. You feel that discomfort or the hesitation to make the first move. It is the same with couples who reconcile after a breakup, except there are plenty of pent up feelings and emotions that you didn’t express to each other. This could be one of the reasons why you may feel disconnected with your now partner. Give it time."
13,Lip Colours That Look Amazing On Dusky Skin Tone,"Growing up with a dusky complexion in India, you probably have been made to believe that bright colours will not look good on you or super dark colours will make you look even darker.

Try red shades with pink undertones as they will lend you radiance, or experiment with deeper maroons if you want a more casual muted colour. Dark lipstick shades don’t look stark on dusky complexions as compared to fair skin tones; therefore, a maroon shade could even be your go-to lipstick colour when in doubt.  "

16,Best Lockdown Fabrics And Styles For Summer Clothes,"Comfort tops the list when we think of summer fashion. And while you might not be able to step out of the house and flaunt the hottest trends of the season, there’s no reason not to dress up while you get through the COVID-19 lockdown! So read this post and find out the best fabrics and styles for summer clothes.  Image: Instagram  Fabrics For Summer Clothes  Wearing the right fabrics in summer will not only keep you feeling comfortable, but will also keep your skin healthy. Here are the best summer fabrics to consider, along with those you would be better off avoiding this season.  Cotton  Cotton comes first to mind for summer clothes for several reasons–it is natural, cheap, easily available, lightweight, breathable, and also soaks up sweat. Cotton keeps the body cool by allowing heat to escape. It does get wrinkled easily and shows sweat patches, but you can consider a cotton-polyester blend to curb these issues. Do remember that with polyester, perspiration absorption goes down so that you might feel some discomfort. Alternatively, choose prints over solids to avoid sweat patches from showing easily.  Bear in mind that cotton spandex or lycra seems to be very comfortable, but they can suffocate your skin. That’s because these fabrics use heavier weight cotton.  Image: Instagram  Linen  Another natural fibre, linen is made from the flax plant and is known for its comfort and cool feel, which make it perfect for summer clothes. Light and loosely woven, linen allows heat to escape from the body, while absorbing sweat readily and drying quickly, keeping you comfortable. Like cotton, linen gets wrinkled easily too, and you can consider linen blends if you wish to.  Khadi  This humble, natural, handspun, organic fabric is ideal for Indian summers. What’s more, khadi is highly durable, so if you’re looking to go the sustainable way, invest in this fabric for summer clothes!  Image: Instagram  Hemp  Hemp is an extremely breathable fabric that is also lightweight, durable, and hardy in that it retains structural quality even after multiple washes. Hemp fabric also contains anti-microbial agents, making it great for those with sensitive skin.  Silk  Natural and lightweight, silk should be one of the ideal fabrics for summer clothes. However, sweat patches are the number one reason to avoid silk in summer. You can consider wearing silk blends or Chanderi, a handloom fabric which is a blend of cotton and silk.  Denim  Our go-to fashion essential isn’t exactly the right choice for summer clothes. Even though all-natural, denim is a heavyweight fabric that isn’t breathable. Skinny jeans, in particular, can be constricting in the heat and can also cause chafing. If you must wear denim, go for comfortable cuts.  Image: Instagram  Chambray  A better alternative to denim is chambray, a plain weave fabric that looks like denim but is much more lightweight. It absorbs sweat readily, is breathable, and comes in darker colours with a natural finish to keep you worry-free in summers.  Tip: Go for all-natural fabrics in summer to keep yourself cool and comfortable all day long. There are several fabrics you can pick from for summer clothes!  Styles For Summer Clothes  Lockdown doesn’t mean you have to rely only on pyjamas all day! There are countless outfit styles for summer clothes you can wear that will not only help you channel your inner fashionista but also keep you comfortable through the day.  Here are some options for summer clothes.  1.Co-Ords  Short for coordinates, co-ords are two-piece separates in matching colours or prints. They’re better than other pieces of clothing for the obvious reason–they can be mixed and matched with everything else in your wardrobe!  Check out these styles by Ananya Panday.  Image: Instagram  Image: Instagram  2. Kurtas  Full-sleeved or sleeveless, ankle or knee-length, plain or printed, there’s no dearth of choices when it comes to the traditional kurta. Chuck the leggings and churidar for summers and pair kurtas with breezy palazzos or straight cut trousers instead.  Take cues from Kangana Ranaut.  Image: Instagram  Image: Instagram  3. Shorts  Shorts and summers go hand in hand! Opt for cotton or linen shorts over denim ones, if you will, and pair with crop tops, blouses, or shirts!  Alaya F. flaunts her eclectic style.  Image: Instagram  Image: Instagram  4. Skirts  Mini skirts might spring to mind, but do give a thought to pleated knee-length skirts or A-line maxi skirts. These flowy cuts and silhouettes will be more comfortable for summer clothes, and you can style them effortlessly with a variety of tops.  Take style tips to skirt from Sonam Kapoor Ahuja.  Image: Instagram  Image: Instagram  5. Jumpsuits  Jumpsuits and playsuits in comfortable summer fabrics can be better than wearing denim or pyjamas. Go for solids or prints and make the most of the season!  We love these jumpsuits worn by Rakul Preet and Shraddha Kapoor.  Image: Instagram  Image: Instagram  Tip: Pick your favourite styles for summer clothes this season from the many options available!  FAQs: Best Lockdown Fabrics And Styles For Summer Clothes  Q. How to remove sweat stains from summer clothes?  A. Sweat stains can be hard to remove. So if you’ve put your favourite clothes at the back of your wardrobe because of the unsightly patches, read these tips:  - Mix two tablespoons of salt in half a litre of hot water. Dab this onto the sweat stains using a soft cloth or sponge until the stains lighten. Rinse and dry as usual.  - Mix freshly squeezed lemon juice with equal parts water. Gently scrub stains using this mixture and see the results for yourself!  - Take dishwashing liquid and hydrogen peroxide in the ratio of 1:2. Scrub the stain gently using this mixture. Let sit for an hour before rinsing.  - Before laundering clothes, dab on a bit of vinegar on the sweat stains. This trick can also be applied to deodorant stains. You can also use ammonia in place of vinegar but refrain from mixing it with bleach.  - Make a paste of baking soda and warm water. Rub the stains gently with this mixture and rinse the garment. For stubborn stains, let the baking soda sit on the stain for about an hour or two.  Image: Instagram  Q. How to prevent chafing in summer?  A. Chafing is a common skin problem in summer that is a result of sweat, friction, and irritating fabric. Opting for the right materials for summer clothes can reduce chafing considerably. Note these points as well:  - Use anti-chafing gels or creams–these are your best bet, especially when the problem gets out of hand in the form of blisters or broken skin.  - For a gentle and effective solution, apply baby powder or regular talcum powder to the skin. You can also use dusting powders which use ingredients like clay, cocoa butter, plant extracts, etc.  - Apply dry shampoo over the areas where the skin is going to rub against itself. Dry shampoo is effective in absorbing moisture so it can help prevent chafing.  - Use a deodorant stick on areas prone to chafing. This will not only keep sweat at bay but also provide lubrication, preventing friction.  - Petroleum jelly can also work in the same way as deodorant sticks.  - When wearing skirts, wear shorts made of moisture-wicking fabric underneath to keep your thighs from chafing.  - Use home remedies to treat chafing. Aloe vera gel can heal and treat inflammation, as can coconut oil. Instead of talcum powder and petroleum jelly, you can use cornstarch and shea butter to prevent chafing."
17,Why Wait?,"Do joyful people find meditation easier to practise than sad, morose people? Is the Self-realisation goal easier to attain for happy people? — Raj, 39, Chennai    When we are happy and full of joyous excitement, our prana, life energy, moves upwards. This upward movement helps us in our spiritual practice. We get better results in our sadhana. If the happiness quotient of a sadhaka continues to increase, then dhyana is deeper and quicker. It is important for a spiritual practitioner to be motivated. The yoga shastras say that a practitioner’s enthusiasm is a significant aspect of his sadhana; it’s his first step towards spiritual progress. If you are not excited about your spiritual practice, then it is difficult to make progress on the path. If you are sad and unhappy, then your prana will soon start waning. Consequently, you will not be able to concentrate. This will allow all sorts of disorders to take root in your mind. That’s why unhappy people are not able to be successful in their spiritual endeavours.    Happiness is the prerequisite for any kind of sadhana, which is why gurus lay emphasis on satsang.    Through satsang, an individual’s mental conflicts are resolved and he becomes peaceful. Once he is in a calmer frame of mind, he can begin his sadhana. Just like stale, musty fruits and flowers are not used as offerings in religious rituals like puja, similarly, a drooping, unhealthy body cannot help you move forward in your sadhana. That’s why it is important to start spiritual practices when you are younger and more energetic and it is even better if children are introduced to spiritual practices. So, start today for stellar results. ■Send your questions to st.editorial@timesgroup.com with subject line: Ask Surakshit and state your age"
18,Reformat Your Memory,"  ANIL K RAJVANSHI tells us how to stop unpleasant thoughts and memories from affecting us adversely    From my younger days, I have had the ability to sense when somebody is thinking about me. This ability allows me to react even before the person has spoken or made his intentions known — most of the time with disastrous results.    Most people, now and then, do exhibit this ability of reading the mind and I feel everybody has this capability though they may not be aware of it.    Brain Power    The brain is not only an instrument that can create thought but it can also send this signal and receive external thoughts. We do have painful memories associated with people, places and objects. Quite often, negative thoughts from them bother us.    How is the external thought received and is it possible to stop it from affecting us? Taking the analogy of modern computers or phone apps may provide a possible answer. An app in the phone or laptop gets its update, notification and data only when the app is on the instrument. If the app is removed from the device, then, no data can be received, though that information is in the ‘environment’.    Similarly, if the painful memory of a person or event is removed from the brain, then, no thought about it can be processed by it.How do you selectively remove painful memories? Recently, scientists have discovered that if we think about a certain person, object, or event, then that memory becomes pliable, that is, it can be modified with a new memory. Neural pathways, when active, are amenable to modifications. If at this time, happy memories are remembered actively, then they might weaken and replace negative thoughts.In a hypnosis session, it is commonly seen that the hypnotist suggests new ideas and thoughts to the patient and these get implanted in the brain.This is useful, especially when a patient is talking about a painful past episode. This way, unpleasant memories can be modified with new, suggested memories. But this is a dangerous process since the other person can play with the patient’s memory, and there have been cases of false memory implanted in quite a number of hypnotised patients with harmful results. Implanting of new memory by oneself is difficult.So, a better way to do so is to practise yoga and meditation. When one is immersed in deep thought on a subject for a long time, then the majority of neural pathways in the brain are used mostly to focus on that thought. This allows other memories to weaken and provides possible opportunity for removal of unpleasant memories.Sanyam, deep thought, according to Patanjali Yoga, can be cultivated with long practice and is the surest way to make the brain supple. Then, unpleasant memories can be reduced and rendered irrelevant.In such circumstances, when external thought impinges on the brain, then it will not be registered, since the memory of that thought (app) is missing or has become corrupted.Often, when a virus affects the computer, the best way to remove it is by formatting the hard disk. Weakening of memories by sanyam provide mechanisms in the brain to do just that, and this is far better than tinkering with selective removal of memory.The loosening of memory also helps one in becoming detached. It is memory that gives rise to attachment either to people or property; when memory becomes weak, detachment results. That is the basic tenet of Patanjali Yoga Darshan. ■The author, a scientist, is director, Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute, Phaltan, Maharashtra"
19,Her Loyal Messenger,"Here, in one more of her short, fictionalised mythological stories, SAISWAROOPA IYER writes of Agnidyotana’s close encounter with divinity in his quest to fulfil a promise he made to Rukmini    The wilderness was daunting. Agnidyotana clutched his staff. His other hand instinctively held what constituted his mission, a letter from Princess Rukmini to the Yadava lord, Krishna Vasudeva. Agnidyotana had been walking for four days now. When his feet could carry him no further, he sank to the ground. Of all the people at Kundinapura, Princess Rukmini had to choose him, an ageing brahmin, for this critical task. He had stuck to a less taken path to avoid being recognised by spies. But the decision had cost him his speed and safety, too. The wilderness around him did not allow him a good night’s sleep. And he was hungry. Could he reach Dwaraka before the stipulated date? O, why didn’t he choose the path close to the shore, friendlier to travellers?    “Shambho Mahadeva! Help me! Help Rukmini assert her consent, Lord!” He tried to trudge ahead. Agnidyotana was stuck in a hostile wild patch where even a stray boar could make a meal of him.    What happened to the merit of his life — of rituals and sadhana? Could the gods not rescue him, especially when someone’s future hung in the balance?Dizzy, Agnidyotana caught hold of the nearest creeper for support. He felt the creeper was too soft — it was a part of a net! A hunter’s net. Just then, he felt the net descend upon him. It meant that he was in an inhabited part of this land. Perhaps the hunter couldhelp him?Soon, he heard footsteps and a flame torch lit up the surroundings and Agnidyotana saw the hunter. “Well, well! If the gods don’t mean to make a cannibal out of me! Why would a human be stuck in my net?”“I need your help, brother!” Agnidyotana did not waste a moment as the hunter helped him out of the net.“Help me reach Saurashtra. At the earliest!”“Gather your breath, Brahmana!” The hunter chuckled.“And who in his right mind would venture into this wilderness? If not the wild animals, hunger would see the last of you! Forget reaching Saurashtra or wherever.”Agnidyotana heard an anklet jingle. A woman? In these surroundings! He saw the bearded hunter grin. She emerged out of what seemed like a narrow path through thickets. It hadto be the hunter’s wife, frowning at what her husband had just said.“Running my reputation along with yours to the ground, aren’t you? What are you, a hunter, there for, if not to kill wild animals?” She chided the hunter and then turned to Agnidyotana. “And the forest has enough to not let anyone go hungry.” She beamed and led the way. “This man here does not see anything beyond graves and pyres. And I belong to a hospitable hill tribe who never lets a guest go hungry!” There was something rhythmic about her lilt and the tinkle of her anklets that Agnidyotana felt was surreal.Before long, they reached an inconspicuous cave that was the hunter’s home and the woman lit a fire to cook a meal. “What brings you to these forests, Brahmana?”Agnidyotana could not keep a secret from the kind couple who were feeding him in the middle of nowhere. Still, he took care to leave out specifics. “A noble maiden has chosen her future Lord. Alas, her elder brother thinks he has the power to seal her future, despite her resistance. I bearher message to her chosen man.”Agnidyotana saw the couple exchange an amused glance. “When this woman chose me, the whole world tried dissuading her. Including me!”“Ignore him. He only meant to test!” The woman interjected with a mock frown turning into a smile when her eyes met her husband’s.“But tell me good sire, your mission seems to concern the affairs of powerful people. Is it safe for you to get in?”“It is the matter of Dharma, kind lady.” Agnidyotana smiled at the aroma of freshly cooked gruel. “All my life, I have been a man of scripture and they proscribe violation of a woman’s consent. The gods I worship get angry at the kingdom that insults women. I am a purohita and it is my duty to take corrective course of action to save my city from the wrath of gods. May they help me in my mission!”The simple gruel was tastier than anything that Agnidyotana had ever eaten before. Energising, too. Like he had eaten enough food for a whole week. “Arise and walk ahead, Brahmana.” The hunter spoke, in a tone surprisingly solemn. “You cannot afford to tarry.”Agnidyotana rose, as if in a trance and picked up his staff. Grunts of wild boars ceased to be a concern, like the thorny path ahead of him. His mind replayed the picture of an anxious Rukmini depending upon his success and he strode ahead all night. In the wee hours, he heard a sound that made his eyes moist with gratitude. The sound of sea waves. He had reached Saurashtra. Dwaraka is nigh!Seated on the snowy top of Mount Kailasa, the god of gods raised a brow, though a knowing smile played on his lips as he turned to the mother of the universe. “The distance he covered within a night, Parvati! What did you feed him?” ■"
20,"Try self-kindness, therapy to beat Covid blues","To help readers cope with their lockdown anxieties, The Times of India has launched Talk it Out, a new series under which our panel of expert counsellors will answer your mental health queries. This week’s advice comes from counselling psychologist Paras Sharma    My wife is suffering from anxiety. She becomes violent, starts hitting me, and feels my parents are conspiring against her. She becomes normal later but gets triggered by almost anything. Is there a way to keep her calm?    — Anonymous    Dear Anonymous, anxiety is one of the most common feelings people are experiencing right now because of the added strain of family members being there all the time, supplies drying up, and it being an uncertain time. It is natural for people to be anxious. First, investigate what the relationship between your wife and parents was like prior to the lockdown. It’s possible that it hasn’t been a pleasant one, and the severity of it is becoming visible to you now because you are at home more, so don’t dismiss it as just her anxiety or paranoia. Secondly, don’t offer solutions to your wife but hear her out.    Ask her what you can do to help with the chores and generally be a little more patient. Lastly, suggest the idea of counselling for her individually and for both of you together.— Utkarsh KapoorHi Utkarsh, I understand this is a difficult time. People haven’t been able to find jobs or had job offers rescinded and this can be demotivating. I’d advise you to focus on your mental health and think of this as a temporary phase which will eventually lift. For now, consider therapy and talk to a friend or a loved one and ensure that your sleep and appetite are regular. You can also practise some mindfulness meditation before you study. Do not have unrealistic expectations from yourself. Even if you are able to concentrate for 30-40 minutes at a time, remind yourself that it’s a difficult time and it’s okay to take breaks while studying.— NainaNaina, I can understand this is a bad situation to be in. It’s important not to blame yourself. I think you can benefit from practising self-kindness because a lot of self-worth comes from our job and relationships, and when we don’t have these, it’s easy to feel worthless. My second advice would be safety and stability. Have you been taking medication and therapy? Check with your psychiatrist if the dosage needs to be temporarily altered. It may be useful to increase your therapy to once a week to process these difficult emotions and have a friend as an SOS contact. There are group therapy options online, where you can talk to people going through similar issues. Finally, you can do some activities like online fitness classes and home workouts.— Anil HotaHi Anil, your problem is as much financial as it is mental. The best thing to do is to have an honest conversation with your family. Sometimes you could be pressured to put on a brave face and make it sound like you have everything under control. But it can be quite difficult to face all of this alone, so confide in your family and discuss what this means in terms of lifestyle changes and temporary restrictions. Secondly, you can speak to vendors and debtors and ask for some time to repay them. You can also apply for an EMI holiday that has been announced. Similarly, GST and IT filing dates have been extended. As far as possible, take these benefits to ease up the pressure.Sharma is director, The Alternative Story.For more questions and answers, visit toi.in."
21,"Practise Eco-philosophy, Celebrate Life","  The value of life has perhaps not been understood as well as it has been in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Indicators of materialistic progress, like GDP and GNP, have receded before life’s love for life. Governments have put their country’s economic plans and programmes on hold, giving precedence to saving lives.    Life loves life, a notion emanating from the eco-philosophy of Henryk Skolimowski, is a universal law . Since life loves to love life, life loves to wish to see life everywhere. -- not just human life, but life in its in the biosphere. Life wishes to see life even beyond Earth, a dream that one day may come true. Other planets in the cosmos where possibilities of life to evolve exist have always engaged our attention. Life wills life to prevail as intensively as possible!    Monocultures are not life-enabling. It tends to evolve and blossom in diversity, in heterogeneity. Not a single species is independent in itself. Every species and every individual of every species is dependent on numerous other species. The higher the level of biodiversity, greater the degree of resilience and sustainability.    When we talk about life, we look deeply into our dependence on all life forms prevailing on Earth.Exploration of other planets with even smallest fraction of similarity with Earth excites entire humanity because, life loves to love life. Our excitement and curiosity know no bounds when even a rudimentary hint of life comes to the fore. We feel thrilled when we look at footprints of what seems like rivers on the surface of the Red Planet; that perhaps there was once life on Mars! Maybe even now there are some microbes present, we don’t know.When we observed the Venus Transit, rare cosmic events that occurred in 2004 and 2012, we celebrated the event with joy. When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon and human footprints were left on the lunar surface in 1969, we felt on top of the world.Here is a poem, titled ‘Life Loves Life,’ written by Juanita Skolimowski, as tribute to her husband, Henryk Skolimowski, who passionately embraced and promoted sustainable living, conservation of life, and light as life-sustaining energy:    The underlying truth    is that Life loves life.    Each living being    Emerges from    the ground of being—    connected and sustained.    The web of Life.    an intricate living mandala:    Radiant and subtle    Magical and mysterious    Fragile and enduring.    The dance of life in all.      Life’s love for life runs through our nerves. We jump with joy when told by scientists that one of the Saturn’s moon’s atmosphere is similar to the Earth’s. So too when the Chandrayan mission discovers the possible presence of water, a symbol of life, on the Moon. The very thought that we may not be alone in the universe fills us with hope. This curiosity, zeal, excitement, thrill, this happiness and joy are all there because of the universal law: Life loves to love life. Life desperately expands its scope, horizon, sphere, light and glory. Life, therefore, cannot be complacent with its existence confined to Earth. It strives for extending its wings to other dimensions. May 4 is celebrated as Eco-philosophy Day.

22,Indian Intellect Vs Bharatiya Viveka Buddhi -1,"1. Intellect is a faculty of mind: Mind is extremely difficult to control. Intellect has to be developed and empowered to manage the uncontrolled and unguided mind. We have the freedom to develop the Intellect for our purposes; good or bad! Viveka buddhi is that intellect which guides us towards the higher, better, highest ‘good’!  Modern societies, aping the western cultures, have kept education focused on developing the IQ aspect of intellect, but have ignored its character-building aspect. We’re happy keeping our minds externally focused, chasing after the infinite variety of science, technology, comforts, glitter of the materialistic world.  2. Vivek-buddhi: Viveka is that power of intellect, which helps us discriminate and enables us choose and follow the virtuous path of ethics, values, dharma, swadharma, in and thru’ our daily working and living. It is the virtuous path that leads to both external material success and internal peace, happiness, fulfilment; not just for ‘us’ but for ‘all’. Bereft of inner spiritual awareness, schooling has failed miserably to awaken and strengthen this faculty of discriminative and determinative intellect. The result is growing materialism, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, greed, selfishness, corruption, etc. Whole society, including Religions, have become self-centered, concerned with ‘Me-Mine’, ‘My-God vs Your-God’.  3. Ancient wisdom mocks at modern India: It asks: With all your sciences and intelligence have you tried to go inwards to discover what this mind and intellect are all about? Have you as society discussed and agreed upon what ‘good’ is? What is the very purpose of our daily working, living, dying? Is it only to help live in this external world controlling and lording over nature and other living beings? Have you as a society explored and analyzed the worldview and vedantic wisdom of our forefathers because of which we survive till today, in spite of all attacks and criticisms? Have you with all your modern socio-religious theories and sciences created a better society where enlightened citizen are guiding us and inspiring us to strive to fulfill our swadharma?  Ancient societies have grappled with these basic issues of, ‘know thyself’; ‘Kingdom of God within’ and created systems where commitment to swadharma, to character, was supreme and the very purpose of education. They have given us the conviction that fulfilling our swadharma can alone guarantee peace, happiness, prosperity. They warn us, beware of systems which allow people without character to positions of public good; beware of building mere IQ-intellect without character!  It asks the greatest intellectuals of today; have you bothered to go deep within yourself to know what intellect and life are all about? It is comparatively easy they say, for the intellect to learn about external nature. It is far more difficult to direct and make the mind and intellect go inwards, to learn about itself. Once we strive and struggle to develop viveka buddhi, go inwards to know our self; our life gradually changes for the better. We become spiritual; we’re no longer a curse to others, we become a blessing for everyone.  Modern society is full of examples of preachers, public servants, rising to positions of power and status beyond their character and competence, ignoring the principle that punishment for transgressions done by people responsible for teaching and managing societies, is going to be much more severe.  4. Whither Religions? The purpose of Prophets of Religions was not to divide people into warring, tribal, selfish attitude of my religion and god vs your religion and god, as their self-centered immature followers have now done! Religions were, and are meant to inspire us to go inwards, purify our mind and intellect, so that the purified-intellect, Viveka buddhi, can be directed inwards; to reflect, analyze, discover the reality of our blissful Spiritual Self and strive to regain our lost connection with it, by being committed to our duties, etc. All Prophets wanted to inspire all people to struggle to be good; to do their duties.  5. Whither Academia? Religions have to unite, rise above petty politics and politicians and work together with academia to awaken and strengthen our Viveka-buddhi. Our sages have very clearly spelt out what this wonderful instrument of mind and intellect is and how to awaken, develop it so that it can learn to choose rightly and gradually rise to the ultimate reality that identified with our spiritual reality the whole world is our family.  Schooling is the opportunity to get established in our swadharma – values, disciplines, habits, vocation, in keeping with our tendencies. Intellect is dangerous, until it is tempered with the ability to discriminate and make right choices and the will power to act on them. This was the idea of our varna dharma. Thus, teachers and public servants were supposed to be men of highest character for they were responsible for guiding society towards the higher dimensions of work and life. They were to spread knowledge and in return, society had the responsibility of taking care of their simple, minimal needs. Ravana is an example of intellectual arrogance not tempered by wisdom.  6. Conclusion: Our parents and teachers now have to ensure that we learn to struggle to overcome our past negative habits during schooling so that the intellect is transformed into Viveka buddhi and used harmoniously both for external material success and internal spiritual success."
23,Corona-induced cuts shouldn’t mar army capabilities,"Most of these proposals have come to our knowledge through media reports, and while we may not know the fine print, the overall thrust is clear. There is an attempt to find ways to alleviate some pressure on the already stressed defence budget that could see a further coronainduced reduction. The idea is laudatory, but we must also not lose sight of the longterm impact of decisions taken today on the overall effectiveness of the military.  Looking first at the proposals concerning the ‘men’ or our human capital of men and women in the military. Two schemes under consideration are the increase of retirement age and the introduction of a three-year ‘Tour of Duty’ in the Indian Army.  The Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, recently announced, “We are soon bringing a policy to extend the service profile of the men and have an increased minimum retirement age” as the defence pension bill was becoming “unsustainable”. With this proposal, almost one-third of the military personnel would retire at the age of 58.  This is a practical move given the much better physical and medical standards that our soldiers enjoy today. Extension of service would prevent a premature haemorrhaging of trained and experienced workforce, particularly in technical services. There will also be a positive effect on the pension bill.  The Army’s proposal on the ‘Tour of Duty’ needs a more serious deliberation. The Army’s internal note has cited a “resurgence of nationalism and patriotism” and the “rising unemployment” to propose a three-year “internship” for those who “do not want to make defence services their permanent vocation, but still want to experience the thrill and adventure of military professionalism”. With this scheme, the Indian Army seeks to save on the training, pay, and gratuity costs of a regular officer or soldier.  In my view, this proposal raises some fundamental questions about the very character of the profession of arms. The military service is a vocation, a higher calling, and a way of life where selfsacrifice is the highest duty. It should not be considered a place for adventure and thrill seekers or a steppingstone for lucrative corporate careers. I have no doubts about the motivation of the young men who will join this “internship” but putting inadequately trained officers and men in combat situations is unfair to both them and their comrades.  Every nation has its unique military challenges, and comparison with other countries that follow a two to three-year conscription model would be inappropriate. In case we require some young talent in specialised areas for a temporary period, we could suitably modify our existing provisions for Short Service Commission and Territorial Army.  The reference to patriotism and nationalism in the Army note was utterly unnecessary. Walter Berns, in his book Making Patriots, defines patriotism as the devotion not only to the country but also to its principles, and equally importantly, an understanding of these principles. Donning the uniform is not the only criteria for displaying your patriotism. It is also a reality, as many studies have shown, that the primary motivation for soldiers in combat is not some higher national ideal but the cohesion of your small unit and the trust in your comrades.  Turning now to the ‘machines’. In giving a push for ‘Make in India’, General Rawat asked the military to stop “misrepresenting our operational requirements” and accept indigenous weapons even if they met “70 percent of the specifications the military ideally required”. There is no doubt that India is one of the biggest arms importers in the world, and this fact is a severe matter of concern. self-reliance in the defence sector is an absolute imperative if India is to become a truly global military power.  However, this will require substantial structural reforms. There is a need for policy changes to encourage the private sector by financial support and preferential treatment over foreign vendors. No company will spend crores in developing weapon platforms if there is no guarantee for purchase by the government. There should be a complete revamping of the Defence Public Sector Undertakings and an overhaul of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, which have shown little innovation in high technology areas.  Asking the military to accept weapons that do not fully meet the operational requirement, only because they are produced in India, is dangerous. In a life and death situation, a soldier’s best friend is his equipment. I have heard many frustrated soldiers express their anguish when their grenades would not explode, or the rifle jammed during an encounter with terrorists.  The problem of inadequate quality is even more critical in equipment-intensive services like the Navy and Air Force. When a pilot is flying a single-seater fighter aircraft, he is highly dependent on the performance of his machine. Lord Moran, in his classic work, ‘The Anatomy of Courage’, writes, “When I ask a station commander what strengthens the resolve of his pilots he answers ‘always leadership’ and then after a pause often adds ‘and the quality of their equipment’.”  The senior military leadership undoubtedly needs to deal with the challenges posed by the size and shape of the defence budget. However, in finding solutions, it must be ensured that the efficiency of the force remains unimpaired."
24,Why prohibition makes little sense in Covid times,"One of the unprepared-for aspects of the continuing lockdown was the 40-day prohibition of over-the-counter sale of alcohol. To complain about its unavailability while people are fighting for lives and livelihoods would be, at best, churlish, and at worst, elitist — such elitism presuming that only a certain socio-economic section of the drinking classes were clamouring for it, a presumption since disproved hopefully by the images of lined-up ‘liquor louts’. So, in a country that goes impractically ‘dry’ — one just hoards up on every ‘dry day eve’ — tipplers bore national temperance (wo)manfully.  True, alcoholic drinks were never going to find themselves on any ‘essential goods’ list. But as the lockdown continued to grind away, the pinch was being also felt by state governments denied their income. Through excise duty revenues, about Rs 2.48 trillion is earned annually across the republic. Turning off this tap, at a time when easy money is tough to find, was self-righteous and self-lacerating.  Displays of social distancing going to the dogs outside thekas since Monday may well roil many a single-malter or cofficionado. But these demand throngs were born out of supply shutdowns — something that should have been soberly factored in when invoking temporary prohibition.  But drinkers have always been an easy target for the mai-baap State. Not content with gathering ‘sin tax’ — where you pay for the sin of drinking, and that money will be well used to ‘better society’ — the State uses both the valid reasoning of additional health expenditure and the less valid excuse of moral turpitude to see alcohol consumption less as a social activity, and more as an evil to be dealt with pragmatically.  This frowning upon drinking is enjoined in the Constitution itself. Article 47 states that ‘the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks’. Interestingly, the perception of drinking being a bad foreign influence, and that the State will strive to get rid of it one sunny day, is somewhat mirrored in Article 343. After failing to phase out the English language over a 15-year period as an official Indian language when the Constitution was adopted in 1950, it now ‘tolerates’ its continued use as official language.  The invisible connection between the English (not language, but rule) and drinking alcohol, made by the likes of Tilak and Gokhale, was echoed as recently as in 2016 by chief minister Nitish Kumar while imposing a total prohibition in Bihar. ‘I want to make it clear to these English-speaking people that consuming liquor is not a part of fundamental rights,’ he said, dedicating the prohibition decision to the ‘Rashtrapita’.  Which is where we can source our mai-baap State’s maternal-paternal discomfort with its uneasy sanctioning of Indian adults drinking: the father of the nation. In their 2005 insightful essay, ‘Poverty and Purification: The Politics of Gandhi’s Campaign for Prohibition,’ historians David M Fahey and Padma Manian explore Mohandas Gandhi’s profound antipathy towards drinkers. ‘… he even went so far as to argue that… “in the wake of drinking follow insanity, adultery, gambling, etc. It depraves the mind and hardens the heart with cruelty.”’  While any prohibitionist’s argument can be used to highlight the correlation between drinking and domestic violence, the correlation is made to grow into a cause. Brawls, wife-beating and child abuse are, indeed, caused by drunken men, but hardly by drunken men alone. Instead of coming down hard on such crimes, the correlated cause — in this case, drinking — becomes the target. The fact that wife-beating can be conducted by a sober man, or indeed female members of a family, are not made to muddy this ‘equation’.  But Gandhi’s success in stigmatising a drinking habit as foreign to India stands on less firm legs. As Fahey and Manian point out, ‘most Indian drinkers were [and remain] poor, illiterate, and lacking in political influence,’ thereby making prohibition ‘a policy with few political disadvantages… except for the Parsis and some Sikhs and Kshatriyas, however, Indian elites, influenced by religion and custom, rarely drank alcohol’.  Fahey and Manian refer to a 1951 Bombay University study that looked at the drinking practices in eight South Gujarat villages. At least one family member drank in 80% of lower caste, Dalit and tribal families; 59% in Muslim families; 7.5% in upper caste families. So, in historian David Hartiman’s words, people like Gandhi ‘confused their own elite values with Indian culture as a whole’.  A call for prohibition threatened to deny significant revenue to the British India administration by way of alcohol sales. This made ample political sense for freedom fighters. But in 2020, swaraj being attained for a while now, GoI abstaining from much-needed revenue bears more than a strong whiff of a colonial hangover. Something I hope to wake up with, minus the colonial bit, tomorrow, for god and country."
