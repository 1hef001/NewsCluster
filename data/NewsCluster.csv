0,UK economy shrank by a record 5.8% in March. Much more pain is to come,"London (CNN Business) The UK economy shrank by a record 5.8% in March as the coronavirus caused huge swaths of business to seize up and the government imposed measures to contain the pandemic.  The contraction is the worst since monthly record keeping began in 1997, according to the UK Office for National Statistics. GDP for the first three months of the year fell 2% compared to the previous quarter, the sharpest decline since the global financial crisis.  ""With the arrival of the pandemic nearly every aspect of the economy was hit in March, dragging growth to a record monthly fall,"" said Jonathan Athow, an economic statistician at the Office for National Statistics. ""Services and construction saw record declines on the month with education, car sales and restaurants all falling substantially,"" he added.  The recession likely gathered significant pace in April and May. UK shops, pubs, restaurants, theaters, cinemas and gyms were only closed in the final week of March, when the government tightened lockdown measures in an effort to contain the pandemic.  ""March's GDP figures showed that the UK economy was already in freefall within two weeks of the lockdown going into effect. And with the restrictions in place until mid-May and then only lifted very slightly, April will be far worse,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.  Read More"
1,Why Gen Z will be hit the hardest by the financial fallout from coronavirus,"London (CNN Business) Will Murrell had hoped to pass his further education exams this summer, at a college in London. He was hunting for a job, in a retail outlet or supermarket , to earn some extra money alongside his studies.  Then Covid-19 struck. Now the 17-year-old is stuck at home with his parents. His exams have been canceled and all his plans are on hold.  ""I've been looking for jobs and now we're in lockdown, so I can't,"" Murrell told CNN. ""It seems like an unnecessary risk.""  Murrell is part of Generation Z, those born after 1997, as defined by the Pew Research Center . The group's eldest members are now graduating into a labor market that's been devastated by the global pandemic.  As a disease, coronavirus disproportionately preys on the elderly. But Generation Z, at least in the short term, is set to bear the brunt of the ensuing financial chaos.  Generation Z's future prospects also look gloomy; the Resolution Foundation's analysis suggests that layoffs linked to the pandemic could affect young people's pay and job prospects in the long-term.  The world is still in the early stages of the most severe economic crisis since the 1930s, with lockdown measures, social distancing and lost production triggering a global recession . In the United Kingdom, the economy could shrink by 14% this year and unemployment is expected to hit 9%.  The impact of unemployment in a recession is particularly severe on those who have just left school. Fewer jobs and internships are available to younger people searching for work, especially in sectors such as hospitality, travel and retail, which provide large numbers of entry level roles and have been slammed especially hard by the effects of the pandemic and efforts to contain it.  In the UK, the unemployment rate for 18-24 year-olds is projected to hit a staggering 27% this year, up from 10.5% in 2019, according to analysis from the Resolution Foundation  This means an extra 640,000 people in the age group are likely to be out of work.  ""The unique nature of the current crisis has damaged the first rung on the employment ladder for a substantial proportion of education leavers -- and it is so far unclear when, and to what extent, these sectors will recover,"" the report notes.  Young bear brunt of crisis  The crisis could leave lasting scars. Thanks to the spike in UK unemployment, today's graduates are 13% less likely to be employed in three years' time compared to a scenario without the pandemic.  Those with mid-level qualifications are 27% less likely to be employed in three years, while the figure rises to 37% for ""lower-skilled"" adults leaving education today, according to the report's projections.  It's a similar story in the United States, where workers under 24 were disproportionately affected by initial layoffs related to coronavirus, according to Richard Fry, senior researcher at the Pew Center.  The shutdown triggered a surge in unemployment in the US, with the county's economy losing 20.5 million jobs in April, the largest decline since the government began tracking the data in 1939.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , unemployment rates in April rose sharply among all major worker groups. The unemployment rate for teenagers aged 16-19 was the highest of all the groups, at 31.9%.  The unemployment rate for adult men in April was 13%, while the same figure for adult women was 15.5%.  ""Initially, at least, layoffs were concentrated in a certain set of industries, which hit the 16-24 age group hard,"" Fry told CNN. ""That initial unemployment was very much concentrated on ... Gen Z. [They] got hit badly.""  Those currently most at risk of layoffs work in retail, in restaurants, hotels and child care -— sectors most affected by social-distancing restrictions. Overall, younger workers make up 24% of those employed in industries at high risk of being shut down in the pandemic, according to the Pew Research Center.  Despite the early data, Fry said Generation Z has some reason to be optimistic. He said the younger group has time to recover from the virus' impact, especially when compared to the Millennial generation.  ""When it comes to wealth-building, one is ... able to better deal with a crisis if you ... have more years to adjust,"" Fry said.  While Fry is cautiously optimistic about Generation Z's prospects, research from the Resolution Foundation suggests that those who leave education during recessions suffer from lower unemployment rates and depressed pay for years after the event.  ""For several years after having left education, employment rates across the cohorts that left education during the [2008] financial crisis were lower than for those who left education after it -- with non-graduates experiencing the largest and longest scarring effects,"" the organization's report notes  Fry added that early anecdotal data showed young adults were drawing on family resources to survive the downturn, often by continuing to live with their parents or by moving back to the family home.  ""During the [2008] recession, Millennials dealt with [the crash] by moving in with Mom and Dad,"" he said. ""We may be seeing Gen Z do the same here. And that's not a path that's as open to older Millennials now. They may have families of their own and aren't able to access those resources. But I don't think we know the long-term impact of this yet. We just don't know how long and deep this downturn is going to be.""  Second setback for Millennials  While the immediate crisis has disrupted Generation Z's education and job prospects, it is the latest in a series of blows for Millennials. The group, which consists of people born between 1981 and 1996, has been shaped by the 2008 global financial crisis and the slow economic recovery that followed.  In 2014, male millennial household heads in the US were found to be earning 10% less than their equivalents in the baby boomer generation in 1978, according to a study by the US Federal Reserve Board . Millennial women were slightly better off than their boomer counterparts, but still earning 3% less than their Generation X equivalents in 1998.  The Pew Research Center defines members of Generation X as those currently aged between 39 and 54, while the baby boomers are aged 55 to 73  ""[The Millennial generation] is a particularly aggrieved cohort of young adults,"" Reid Cramer, non-resident fellow at the New America Foundation, told CNN. ""Already their prime work and family forming years were significantly undermined by coming of age in the great recession.""  ""They have lower savings. They have a lower trajectory for [building] long-term wealth. And many are not living in individual households -- instead they're in communal arrangements or still with their parents.""  Millennials also have less of a savings buffer to see them through the coming disruption. Between 2014 and 2016, 52% of British people aged 22-29 had no money set aside in a saving accounts, according to the Office for National Statistics.  In the US, 27% of the age group have no savings, according to a Bank of America report released in January. Despite this, nearly a quarter of those aged 24-41 who did save had more than $100,000 in savings.  Unlike Generation Z, Millennials did not graduate amid what may be the worst global recession since the 1930s. But that's all likely to be cold comfort for a group that, in the United States, is on track to be the first generation not to accumulate more wealth than their parents.  Searching for solutions  Cramer believes that young people need greater help from government to recover from the financial impact of Covid-19. He argues that public policy should be used to address ""the overhang of student debt"" hindering millennials in the US.  A similar sentiment is growing in the UK, with regards to housing policy. Home ownership rates among the young have dropped, with Britons in their 30s and 40s three times more likely to be renting today than 20 years ago.  ""Millennials are enormously, enormously disadvantaged when it comes to housing,"" said Jim O'Neill, chair of the Chatham House think tank and a member of Britain's House of Lords. ""I hope there's more [government] focus in the future on providing social [...] and affordable housing.""  Cramer told CNN the recession following 2008 had affected Millennials in another way -- the group is reaching the traditional markers of adulthood at later dates, or not at all.  ""In America Millennials have a significantly lower home ownership rate but that only captures some of the challenges,"" he said. ""Fewer are of them are getting married [and] having children. These were traditional elements of the aspirational American Dream.""  That dream was perhaps best captured by the baby boomers, who remain the richest generation in both the US and UK. This doesn't look likely to change soon, with Millennials enduring reduced social and economic progress and Generation Z now facing a similar fate."
2,Spain to impose 14-day quarantine for international arrivals,"(CNN) — Spain will implement a 14-day mandatory quarantine for travelers arriving from overseas starting Friday, according to a decree from the country's health ministry.  The decree covers ""people coming from other countries, on their arrival in Spain.""  Travelers will be required to provide a completed passenger location card to the authorities so they can be contacted during quarantine, and will have to quarantine at home or in their place of accommodation.  They will be allowed out for essential needs like food, pharmaceutical products, visiting healthcare centers and for emergency situations, but are required to wear a mask if they go outside.  Related content Trapped in paradise: Breaking quarantine could mean prison time for tourists in Hawaii  Some people, like freight carriers and healthcare workers, will be exempt from the quarantine rules as long as they have not been in contact with any known patients.  Spain remains under a state of emergency , which began on March 14 with strict stay-at-home confinement orders. It is in place until at least May 23, but officials have begun to ease some restrictions in low-risk territories.  ""During the period of de-escalation, the monitoring and health control measures for all international travelers (arriving in Spain) should be increased, to avoid the imported cases,"" said the order from the health ministry."
3,Tornadoes possible in Tornado Alley on Wednesday,"(CNN) A very active spring severe weather season will continue Wednesday in Tornado Alley, a part of the central US known for severe storms  Tornado Alley -- which spans Texas to the Dakotas -- typically sees a large number of tornadoes each year.  The Storm Prediction Center has placed an ""enhanced"" risk level of 3 out of 5 for a portion of Tornado Alley in the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma and southern Kansas in the afternoon.  Potentially affected cities include Wichita Falls and Vernon in Texas and Lawton and Altus in Oklahoma.  Read More"
4,Vongfong is the first named storm of the year in the West Pacific,"(CNN) The 2020 West Pacific typhoon season is off to a slow start. It took until Tuesday for the first named storm of the year -- Vongfong -- to form, but it has quickly become a threat to the Philippines.  The West Pacific typhoon season doesn't have a defined beginning and end like the Atlantic hurricane season as storms can form throughout the year. While the peak of the typhoon season is late summer, there are frequently named storms in the winter or early spring due to the warm waters of the Pacific.  This is the eighth-latest start to the season since 1950, according to Colorado State University research scientist Phil Klotzbach. The last time we had a later start was 2016 when the first named storm of the season didn't arrive until the first week of July.  Tropical Storm Vongfong  Tropical Storm Vongfong is located just east of the central Philippines and is slowly drifting northward. During the day Wednesday the storm is forecast to slowly turn to the west and begin to approach the central Philippines.  Read More"
5,Afghan President orders resumption of offensive operations against the Taliban in blow to Trump's deal,"(CNN) The Trump administration's peace deal with the Taliban was dealt yet another blow Tuesday as the Afghan government announced it was resuming offensive operations against the insurgent group following a spate of deadly terrorist attacks.  Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani announced the resumption of offensive operations during a televised address to the nation that took place in the wake of several deadly terrorist attacks , including one that targeted a maternity hospital that killed at least 13 people, including two newborn babies.  ""I strongly condemn recent attacks on a hospital in Kabul and Nangarhar province which killed a number of innocent people including women and children,"" Ghani said Tuesday.  The Taliban denied being responsible for the attack on the hospital and a second attack on a funeral procession that took place in Nangarhar province on Tuesday.  As part of the deal negotiated between the Trump administration and the Taliban, the Afghan government, although not party to the agreement, agreed to suspend offensive operations against the Taliban and expressed willingness to partake in a ceasefire with the insurgent group.  The ""Taliban have rejected our repeated call for a ceasefire, calls for ceasefire doesn't mean weakness,"" Ghani said Tuesday, adding: ""I once again call on them to embrace peace, which is not only a demand of the government but the nation and international community.""  However, in the weeks following the signing of the deal, the Taliban ramped up its attacks on Afghan soldiers and police and the number of civilian deaths attributed to the group also increased, according to the UN.  Asked about Kabul's resumption of offensive operations against the Taliban, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Tuesday she had no new information to provide on the matter.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement later Tuesday condemning the two attacks and calling them ""horrific"" and ""unconscionable"" while making no direct reference to the resumption of offensive operations by Afghanistan's military.  ""We note the Taliban have denied any responsibility and condemned both attacks as heinous. The Taliban and the Afghan government should cooperate to bring the perpetrators to justice,"" Pompeo said, adding that ""as long as there is no sustained reduction in violence and insufficient progress towards a negotiated political settlement, Afghanistan will remain vulnerable to terrorism.""  The Pentagon referred CNN to the government of Afghanistan but said the US military would continue to conduct ""defensive strikes"" in support of Afghan National Security and Defense forces (ANDSF).  ""The US military will continue to conduct defensive strikes against the Taliban when they attack our ANDSF partners,"" Defense Department spokesman Lt. Col. Thomas Campbell told CNN.  The Pentagon has recently ceased providing data on the number of Taliban attacks and the number of US airstrikes in Afghanistan, citing the sensitivities involved in the negotiations with the Taliban.  A US defense official told CNN that the US military conducted nearly 100 such defensive strikes against the Taliban during the month of March.  The Pentagon did not answer questions as to whether the US military would come to the aid of Afghan forces if they were attacked while participating in offensive operations or whether the US would provide intelligence, logistical or other support to such anti-Taliban operations.  Earlier Tuesday, Afghanistan's national security adviser suggested that there is no point to ""peace talks"" when the Taliban do not intend to pursue peace.  ""The attacks of the last two months show us and the world that Taliban & their sponsors do not and did not intend to pursue peace,"" Hamdullah Mohib wrote on twitter.  ""If the Taliban can not control the violence, or their sponsors have now subcontracted their terror to other entities —which was one of our primary concerns from the beginning— then their (sic) seems little point in continuing to engage Taliban in 'peace talks,' "" he added.  ""The reason to pursue peace is to end this senseless violence. This is not peace, nor its beginnings,"" he wrote.  ""There is no real alternative to peace,"" a State Department official said in response to the tweets from Hamdullah, noting that the national security adviser who has been a harsh critic of the US-Taliban talks in the past may be looking for a way to derail peace with the Taliban. The official added that without the peace process the US believes there would be more violence in Afghanistan, not less.  While the peace deal negotiated by the Trump administration continues to suffer setbacks amid rising Taliban violence, the US military has continued to withdraw troops from the country despite the Pentagon saying that the Taliban are not adhering to their commitments under the deal.  The US plans to draw down its forces in Afghanistan to about 8,600 personnel by mid-July, a reduction of some 4,000 troops from when the agreement was signed.  ""We know that we can do all of the missions we need to do at 8,600, but we are not going to be blamed for not living up to our end of the agreement,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters last week.  Asked about the attacks in Afghanistan on Tuesday, US national security adviser Robert O'Brien said that ""it's now time for the Afghan people to get together, to enter into a meaningful peace process, and it's time for America to come home. We've got a lot to focus on here."""
6,Midwives face fear and new challenges as the coronavirus spreads in Africa,"(CNN) When midwife Philomena Owusu Domfe gets up for work every day she is scared.  Domfe has been at the Ridge Hospital in Accra, Ghana's capital city, for eight years. Now each day she shows up to work, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in her country grows.  Ghana had more than 4,200 confirmed cases and 22 deaths resulting from the virus as of May 12. And while social distancing is prescribed by the World Health Organization as a key defense against the spread of Covid-19, Domfe said it's difficult when proximity with her patients and their newborns is a job requirement.  ""It is a big challenge,"" she told CNN. ""I am scared but it is the work I have chosen to do, so I have to render my services.""  Adapting to Covid-19  Midwives like Domfe have to protect themselves and, at the same time, sustain the level of care for expectant mothers. To do so, they have adjusted how they operate.  ""We have given numbers to pregnant women so that if they have any problem, they can call us. It's not like before where they (could) come in at any time,"" said Domfe.  According to her, prenatal classes don't take place as often as they used to before the pandemic. And when they do, pregnant women at the clinic are given different appointment times to limit the numbers.  The nurses also inquire about their travel history in addition to other routine checks.  ""We check for their travel history so that if we suspect that the client may be a potential Covid-19 patient, then we place them in a holding center where samples will be taken and they will be tested for the virus,"" Domfe said.  Like many other health care workers on the continent, midwives must use protective gear while attending to their patients.  Fatou Joof, who has worked as a midwife for 15 years in the Gambia, told CNN that she puts on gloves and wears her mask all the time. ""We are always using safety precautions ... we use masks, we hand-wash, we wear gloves,"" she explained.  Midwife Fatou Joof examines a woman at the Serrekunda Health Centre.  As prescribed by the WHO, face masks can protect the wearer from large-particle droplets, and help prevent the spread of infection from the person wearing the mask to others.  Joof works at the Serrekunda Health Center, 12 kilometers from the Gambian capital city, Banjul.  While she worries about working as the virus has infected more than 90,000 health workers worldwide, she said she is comforted by the fact that she is protecting herself and saving lives.  ""We cannot leave the mothers, we have to attend to them during antenatal and postnatal. I'm motivated to do this because I save lives. The lives of mothers,"" she said.  Inadequate handwashing facilities  But Joof may be one of the lucky ones. Many midwives do not have access to resources like clean water and soap needed to protect themselves from Covid-19.  Patricia Mwenyeheri, a midwife in Malawi said there are only two handwashing basins at the Mzandu Health Center where she works.  ""We have been provided with two handwashing facilities. The problem is that at the maternity ward, we have several departments which means that we need to have more of such hands-free facilities which are critical during this Covid-19 pandemic,"" she said in an interview with international charity WaterAid.  Patricia Mwenyeheri uses one of the two hand basins at the health center where she works.  WaterAid provided Mwenyeheri's health center with water connections for its toilets, handwashing basins, and bathrooms.  Mwenyeheri's department -- the maternity ward -- has access to only one of the handwashing basins, making it difficult to ensure washing of hands with soap and water as advised by the WHO.  ""On average, we attend to more than 300 clients. So, having one handwashing facility for all of them is difficult to manage but we insist that everyone should wash their hands before we attend to them,"" she said.  Delivering babies  According to UNICEF, an estimated 116 million babies will be born under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Joof said she is worried about delivering babies during the pandemic because social distancing cannot apply at the point of delivery.  ""You have to go close to the woman and deliver the baby so you protect yourself by washing your hands, putting on gloves, and using masks always,"" she said.  Dr. Daniel Roshan, an obstetrician-gynecologist based in the US, said in situations where the expectant mother has Covid-19, doctors and midwives should wear protective garments including overalls.  ""If there is a patient known to have Covid-19 they can limit the exposure of health care workers in the labor room by using just one doctor and one nurse,""' he told CNN.  Roshan, who is also the founder of Rosh Maternal and Fetal Medicine , a center providing gynecological care, said mothers cannot transfer the virus to their newborns from the womb but can after delivery due to exposure.

MUST WATCH Nigerian citizen: I prefer to die from Covid-19 than hunger 01:47  Mothers who have tested positive for the virus should be separated from their babies until they become asymptomatic, he said.  ""If the mother refuses and wants to be with the baby then it is up to her. She should not be forced but she has to understand the risk that comes with that,"" he added.  But the work does not end with the birth of babies. Midwives and other health care workers have to teach new mothers how they can prevent themselves and their babies from contracting the virus.  Domfe said she and her colleagues are telling new moms to discourage family members from holding their babies as visitors can also bring infections into the home.  Mothers also have to wash their hands thoroughly and maintain good hygiene while breastfeeding, she said.  Domfe said working during the pandemic is overwhelming because there is a lot of adapting to do. But she stays motivated by reminding herself that she is helping hundreds of women through difficult times.  ""I protect myself and pray to God to protect me,"" she said."
7,"While the wealthy self-isolate, the poor can't afford to stay put in Sao Paulo","Sao Paulo (CNN) The glass towers in Sao Paulo's financial district are shuttered, bars closed and restaurants open only for delivery. But on the outskirts of the city, residents say they can't afford to stop working, even if it means risking their lives.  ""If you stay at home, you'll just starve to death,"" said Dejair Batista, who owns a hair salon in Brasilandia, one of the biggest favelas and the deadliest neighborhood in terms of Covid-19 fatalities, according to the Sao Paulo Municipal Health Secretariat. More than 120 residents have died from complications related to the virus so far, according to officials.  Overall, Brazil is Latin America's hardest-hit country , with the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus climbing by the thousands every day. The death toll has topped 12,000 with more than 177,000 confirmed cases, according to health officials. Nearly 4,000 of the deaths are in Sao Paulo state.  An aerial view of Brasilandia amidst the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on May 10, 2020 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed Covid-19 as a ""little flu"" and urged businesses to reopen even as many governors scramble to implement social-isolation measures and slow the spread. Sao Paulo has been under quarantine since March.  On a recent afternoon Batista cracked open the sliding metal door to his salon, put on a mask and called out to potential clients that he was open, defying a state-wide order to close all but essential businesses.  ""If I could choose, I would stay at home. But I have to go out, there is no other way,"" Batista said, explaining that he supports his sister and his niece. ""I'm behind on all of my bills, last month, this month.""  Brasilandia, built into the hills in the northern part of Sao Paulo, is home to more than 260,000 people. In all, according to the official census, more than 11 percent of the city's residents live in favelas and many of them work in the informal economy that has largely disappeared during the coronavirus crisis.  Residents wait for food donations organized by NGO Kapadocia Institute for poor families from Capadocia Slum at Brasilandia district amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, May 1, 2020.  Nair Barbosa cleaned houses, but was let go when the family she worked for started sheltering at home. She has signed up for the temporary federal unemployment benefit worth $100 a month and waited in a crowded line with other residents for over an hour at the government agency office in Brasilandia to pick up her first check. She came out empty handed.  ""The system crashed,"" she said. ""I'll have to go home and come back later today.""  According to Sao Paulo Health Secretary Edson Aparecido, although coronavirus was brought to Brazil by wealthy travelers returning from vacations in Italy and the Colorado ski slopes, the poor will be hit hardest.  ""Where people are dying is on the outskirts of the city. That's why social isolation is so important,"" Aparecido said.  But, as with many of the favelas, social isolation is very difficult in Brasilandia. Multiple generations are often packed under one roof and there are few public parks or other public spaces. For healthcare, there are clinics, but no big hospitals.  ""It started as the so-called imported virus by people living in better conditions,"" said Aparecido. ""But now that it's gone to the outskirts, you can see what's happening."""
8,Cuba slams US over shooting attack on embassy in Washington,"Havana (CNN) Cuba's foreign minister on Tuesday lashed out at the Trump administration for ""complacent silence"" following a shooting at the Cuban Embassy in Washington, DC , and for trying to thwart Cuban efforts to battle the coronavirus.  ""In the midst of the pandemic, the Secretary of State Mr. [Mike] Pompeo is constantly advocating against Cuban medical cooperation and slandered Cuban medical doctors instead of saying one word about the terrorist attack that happened a few blocks not only from the White House but from the State Department,"" Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla told CNN in an interview on Tuesday.  Rodriguez Parrilla said the US government has shown little cooperation following the incident in April when a man opened fire on the Embassy, riddling the front of the building with gunfire. He said the State Department has been slow to share information and that senior administration officials failed to condemn the attack.  ""The attacker confessed that he aimed to kill. It's a very serious issue,"" Rodriguez Parrilla told CNN. ""Can you imagine that which would be the US reaction in a similar case of a similar attack against an American embassy anywhere in the world?""  The Trump administration has tightened economic sanctions on Cuba and asked countries not to accept Cuban medical assistance to fight the coronavirus outbreak, arguing that the doctors and nurses Cuba sends are underpaid and used for propaganda purposes.  But the US State Department said that despite political differences, Cuban diplomats are safe in the US.  ""The Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service works closely with law enforcement agencies to protect and maintain the security and safety of foreign missions in the United States,"" said a statement issued by the US Embassy in Havana on Tuesday. ""The US law enforcement process is transparent with strict jurisprudence and many records about cases and court proceedings publicly available.""  Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Eduardo Rodriguez Parrilla at UN Headquarters in New York on September 28, 2019.  Cuban citizen arrested for attack  Embassy surveillance video of the incident released by the Cuban government to CNN showed the alleged assailant arriving by car at around 2 am ET on April 30th and opening fire through a fence with an automatic weapon.  The video shows white plumes of smoke in the dark night air as a fusillade of bullets hit the front of the Embassy, breaking a window and piercing a metal statue of Cuban revolutionary hero Jose Martí. Nobody was injured, although 10 Cuban diplomats and staff were inside and bullets entered the building.  Police arrested Alexander Alazo, a Cuban citizen living in the US, and charged him with possessing an unregistered firearm and assault with intent to kill as well as charges related to attacking a foreign embassy. Alazo is currently detained awaiting trial.  Police said they recovered an AK-47 and 32 spent shells from the scene, according to court documents. A gasoline-soaked Cuban flag was also recovered from the scene with hand-written messages including ""Trump 2020,"" according to the documents.  In the documents, police say Alazo told them that he had been hearing voices and attacked the Embassy ""because he wanted to get them before they got him, referring to the Cuban government.""  Alazo told investigators he was afraid Cuban ""criminal organizations"" might be tracking him and had been living out of his car for nine months before the Embassy attack.  A court-appointed attorney for Alazo did not return messages from CNN requesting comment Tuesday.  Rodriguez Parrilla said Alazo had completed his military service on the island and had no history of criminal conduct or mental illness before he moved to Mexico in 2003 and then to the US. He'd also returned to Cuba eight times and had worked as a pastor on the island, he said."
9,Hong Kong is pushing a controversial national anthem bill just as protests are kicking off again,"Hong Kong (CNN) After five months of being at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic, new infections in Hong Kong have slowed to a trickle, and the city is slowly getting back to normal . Which, these days, means protests .  Many are not waiting for the final coronavirus restrictions to be lifted. During protests over the weekend, police arrested some 230 people on a variety of charges, including unlawful assembly and refusing to abide by social distancing regulations.  Such disturbances are only likely to increase, with summer being the city's traditional protest season around the key anniversaries of June 4, for the Tiananmen Square massacre , and July 1, which marks Hong Kong's handover to Chinese control, as well as a host of new key dates created by last year's protests  The government has attempted to wield public opinion against the protesters, pointing out that people are already hurting economically from the coronavirus crisis and now is not the time for further public disturbance. The heavy police response to initial protests also seems designed to dissuade anyone on the fence from joining in.  At the same time, however, the government is pushing ahead with a piece of legislation that -- like the extradition bill that kicked off last year's protests -- has sparked concern among moderate Hong Kongers about increasing Chinese encroachment and undermining of the city's political freedoms.  On Tuesday, the government said lawmakers will resume debate on the Chinese national anthem bill on May 27. The proposed law will make it a crime punishable by up to three years in prison ""to insult the national anthem.""  ""The national anthem is the symbol and sign of the country,"" Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong's chief secretary and number two official, said in a statement. ""(The purpose of the law) is to preserve the dignity of the national anthem so that members of the community would respect the national anthem.""  Hong Kong is part of China, but the semi-autonomous city has its own legal and political system, with limited democracy and greater personal freedoms than on the mainland. The city competes as itself in many arenas, such as the Olympics and international football matches, but uses China's national anthem, ""March of the Volunteers,"" which is also played at official ceremonies.

Previous laws introduced in Hong Kong by law of Annex III include Per Article 18 of the Basic Law , ""laws listed in Annex III ... shall be confined to those relating to defense and foreign affairs as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the Region.""Previous laws introduced in Hong Kong by law of Annex III include regulations regarding China's exclusive economic zone , which has an effect on territorial claims in the South China Sea, and legislation regarding foreign banks.  That this can be applied to cover legislation regulating the country's national anthem shows the fairly broad remit Beijing sees the law as providing. What checks exist on this ability are only really provided by the Hong Kong legislature, and the local government's previously stated commitment to allowing lawmakers to debate such laws rather than simply promulgating them unilaterally.  Nor is Annex III the only way the Chinese government can influence laws in the semi-autonomous city, beyond its appointment of Hong Kong's leader and influence on pro-Beijing lawmakers. The NPC can also issue ""interpretations"" of constitutional issues, such as in 2016, when it intervened in a debate over oath-taking to rule that lawmakers who had staged protests during their swearing-in ceremony had voided their election and were barred from taking their seats.  Hong Kong's legislature began debating the national anthem law early last year, before the protests over the extradition bill brought all procedures to a stop and shut down the legislature for several months. In its statement Tuesday, the government said it wanted to pass the law before the current legislative session ends in July and any outstanding work becomes defunct, meaning the entire process would have to start over again.

MUST WATCH Hong Kong football fans boo China's anthem (2017) 01:16  Sweeping powers  Passage of the law seems inevitable without the kind of radical action taken by protesters last year to block the extradition bill. Opposition lawmakers do not have the numbers to block the law, and while filibustering and other procedural tactics have succeeded in slowing it in the committee stage, they have largely run their course.  Once law, it will be illegal to misuse or insult ""March of the Volunteers,"" with offenders subject to a fine of up to $6,450 (50,000 HKD), and three years in prison. Schoolchildren, including those at international schools, would also be legally required to learn the anthem, which opens with the line, ""Arise, we who refuse to be slaves!""  Multiple legal and human rights bodies have criticized the law for undermining freedom of expression and contravening Hong Kong's constitutional protections.  Both the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Progressive Lawyer's Group (PLG), which represent legal professionals in the city, raised concerns that the wording of the law left it open to abuse and uncertainty, with the PLG saying in a statement that it is ""poorly drafted and appallingly lacking in clarity.""  joint statement from 38 Hong Kong civil society groups warned the law ""could have chilling effects on dissent and become a tool for the government to suppress opposition.""  Pro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick shouts at security trying to restrain him during an angry Legislative Council session in Hong Kong on May 8, 2020.  Long year ahead  A spokesman for Hong Kong's Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau said Tuesday that the spirit of the bill was ""respect,"" adding that a person would only commit an offense if they publicly and intentionally insulted the national anthem. He denied that the law was ""draconian"" or that there was any risk of ""suppressing the freedom of speech.""  Government officials have previously said they hope not to see any prosecutions, that the law itself would be sufficient to engender ""respect"" for the anthem, a suggestion ridiculed by opposition lawmakers.  ""Respect cannot be won via legislation,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told CNN last year. ""Respect has to be won by oneself. You cannot threaten and force others to respect you unwillingly.""  Nor are protesters who have regularly taken to using the phrase ""Chinazi"" and defacing the Chinese flag during demonstrations likely to stand and salute as ""March of the Volunteers"" plays.  If and when the bill passes, its revocation will likely become another protest demand, as anti-government unrest will inevitably kick into high gear again."
10,India coronavirus: The way these states handled the virus shows the country's vast divide,"New Delhi, India (CNN) In January this year, Kerala became the first Indian state to report a coronavirus case . Now, four months later, it claims it has flattened the curve.  Although India has been under a strict nationwide lockdown since late March, cases have continued to rise -- the country of 1.3 billion now has more than 74,000 confirmed cases, including more than 2,400 deaths.  But Kerala, a thin strip on the country's southern coast, has appeared to buck that trend.  Although its has a population of around 36 million -- almost as big as Canada -- it has reported just 519 cases and four deaths. As of Saturday, it had only 16 active cases, according to the state's finance minister, Thomas Isaac.  Medical staff collect samples from people at a kiosk to test for Covid-19 in Kerala, India, on April 6, 2020.  For comparison, Maharashtra, the worst-affected state in India, has reported more than 23,000 cases , including more than 860 deaths.  Even accounting for their different population sizes, the states have very different outbreaks. Maharashtra has around 19 cases per 100,000, while Kerala has about 1. By way of comparison the United States, which has the world's highest reported death toll, has around 415 cases per 100,000 people.  Experts say part of Kerala's success is thanks to swift action and learning from past outbreaks. But Kerala also shows how disparate India is -- and how much a person's chances against the virus depend on where in the country they live.  What Kerala did right  At the center of Kerala's response was woman who has been nicknamed ""the coronavirus slayer.""  In the second week of January -- before the state, and by extension India, had reported its first coronavirus case -- Kerala's Minister of Health and Social Welfare, KK Shailaja, noticed reports of a virus spreading in Wuhan, China.  With many students from Kerala studying in Wuhan, KK Shailaja suspected it was just a matter of time before the virus arrived in the state. In late January, the ministry set up 18 expert groups for different facets of the outbreak control, covering everything from contact tracing and screening, to logistics and mental health. ""We planned everything,"" she says.  From January 24, the government screened all passengers returning from China, and sent all symptomatic patients to designated isolation facilities. On January 30 , Kerala confirmed its first coronavirus patient -- a student who had been studying in Wuhan.  Authorities identified the first patient by screening all 172 passengers on a plane from Wuhan, and isolating three students who had minor symptoms in hospital. They were also able to trace more than 70 people who had been in close contact with the students, Shailaja said.  And even when there were no new cases, the state continued being vigilant.  ""Some asked us why we were being so overactive because there were no cases now in Kerala,"" she says. ""We were told we over reacting but we didn't withdraw our teams because we were reading about this virus going to other countries.""  As Oommen Kurian, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, put it: ""(Kerala) reacted as if it's a very deadly disease from the beginning when people were actually doubtful across the world about the deadliness of the virus.""  Back in 2018, the state was hit by an outbreak of Nipah virus, which killed 18 people within a few weeks. There is no treatment or vaccine for Nipah, which has a fatality rate of between 40 to 75% -- much higher than Covid-19  Kerala managed to contain the disease in a short space of time -- and the most important thing was contact tracing, Shailaja said.  Indian citizens evacuated from Maldives arrive at the Cochin port in Kochi in the south Indian state of Kerala on May 10, 2020.  ""We understood that for any contagious virus, the first thing we have to do is contact tracing and to break the chain,"" she said. ""If we trace the contact properly, we can isolate the person from others and we can break the chain and flatten the curve of the epidemic. This is the same thing we applied here.""  ""Kerala acted from the beginning ... and has not lowered its guard yet,"" said Rajeev Sadanandan, Kerala's former health secretary and the chief executive of non-profit Health Systems Transformation Platform. ""No other Indian state did anything remotely comparable.""  How Kerala compares  Hundreds of miles north in the state of Maharashtra, health authorities haven't seen the same success. The state -- which has roughly the same population size as Japan -- has the largest number of cases of anywhere in India. Many of those are in Mumbai, one of India's most populous cities, which is home to a number of slums.  According to Amey Ghole, Health Committee Chairman of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, the city took the outbreak seriously ""from day one.""  ""On February 19, we found our first patient and admitted them to hospital. We were the first to stop flights from China. Maharashtra was the first state to lockdown the cinemas and malls,"" he said.  The state took other measures. On March 16, the state health minister, Rajesh Tope, announced that it would use indelible ink to stamp the hands of individuals who have been asked to self-quarantine at their own homes to prevent them from going out.  The state created containment zones and cordoned off areas, Ghole said. Authorities have been testing in slums -- which have been a big concern in India -- and increased the number of beds in quarantine facilities, he said.  But according to Kurian, Maharashtra didn't act as quickly as Kerala. Like much of the rest of the world, they were biding their time. ""Maharashtra was reactive,"" he added, rather than proactive.  Sadanandan said Maharashtra had no contact tracing system, so when cases showed up at hospitals, they had no way of using information about their contacts to prevent further spread.  Once infection reaches the community, prevention doesn't work, said Sadanandan. In places where community spread has taken hold, it's already too late to put in place Kerala's strategy of quarantining high-risk people, testing and treating them, and tracking everyone they have had contact with.  Groom Vitthal Koditkar, left, of Hirpodi village speaks with his bride Vrushali Renuse, right, of Pabe village and family members after their wedding during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown at Pabe village in Pune district in Maharashtra, India.  ""Slums or any community are the endpoints. The battle is lost when it has reached the community,"" he said.  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has repeatedly denied any community transmission across India.  Unlike Kerala, Maharashtra hadn't dealt with a recent viral outbreak, so they weren't as prepared for the onslaught, Kurian said. Now, it's too late to bring in strong contact tracing, he said. If Maharashtra were to start contact tracing now, it would have an uphill task -- it now has more than 23,000 confirmed cases, who have likely each been in touch with a number of people.  ""The thing about contact tracing is that it is very easy to get overwhelmed if you go over the threshold,"" he said. ""The silent spread has already happened in Maharashtra.""  Why Kerala's success isn't a surprise  In a way, it's no surprise that Kerala has had success against the coronavirus -- it already has some of the best healthcare outcomes in India.  According to government statistics, Kerala has a comparatively high number of public healthcare centers. It also has the lowest maternal mortality rate, one of the lowest infant mortality rates, and the highest life expectancy at birth of any Indian state, at 74.2 for a man.  According to Sadanandan, Kerala has a good primary care system and well-trained health workers. Those things, in turn, meant the government health system had credibility and trust with the public, Sadanandan said.  It also helped that Kerala's literacy rate is high, with around 94% of the population literate, according to the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 73%. That improved the state's ability to communicate the risk, said Kurian.  ""Education was seen as an investment in Kerala for a long time,"" Kurian added.  Nurses light candles at Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Kochi, Kerala, on May 12, 2020, to mark International Nurses Day, celebrated on the birthday of Florence Nightingale.  And Kerala is relatively well-off. In 2017-2018, the latest year for which statistics are available, it had a per capita GDP of 184,000 Indian rupees , compared with a nationwide average of 114,958.  Kerala's health outcomes are not the norm. Healthcare -- and social indicators such as access to safe drinking water that influence healthcare outcomes -- vary widely between different states, Sadanandan said.  Maharashtra's health outcomes fall far behind Kerala. Male life expectancy is 69.9, and its infant mortality rate is almost twice as high as Kerala's, with 19 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 10.  Although Maharashtra has some of the best hospitals in India, according to Kurian, some of those have been compromised because the virus has spread to health care workers and within hospitals. Last month, the Indian Medical Association said doctors in India faced challenges of being attacked and had a lack of personal protective equipment.  ""Many doctors have tested positive for the virus already and those of us working on the frontlines at government hospitals live in hostels where effective social distancing is not possible,"" a Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors spokesperson said.  What the future holds  While Kerala has flattened the curve for now, the challenges aren't over. ""We are bracing ourselves for the 3rd wave,"" Isaac, the state's finance minister, tweeted . Kerala's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has a similar sentiment: ""Til those who are undergoing treatment are fully cured and those under observation complete their quarantine period, we cannot let our guard down one bit.""  India's lockdown is set to lift later this month, and some experts expect cases to increase.  India stopped commercial flights into the country in March, but last week it began repatriation flights for Indians overseas who are stranded or lost their jobs. Kerala has large numbers of people working and living overseas, meaning many of those being repatriated will be headed for Kerala.  And Kerala has the oldest population in India, making its population potentially more vulnerable -- 13% of the population are aged 60 or older, compared with the nationwide average of 8.2%. In Maharashtra, for comparison, 9.1% of the population are 60 or older.  Indian citizens evacuated from Maldives look outside the Indian Navy INS Jalashwa ship as it arrives to Cochin port in Kochi on May 10, 2020.  Kurian warns that it's not the time to be complacent.  ""The real fight is just coming. Once the international travelers come back and the migrants come back and the local economy starts operating again, That is when the next wave will hit Kerala, and if they're caught napping, it will look a lot like Mumbai.""  In 2017, Indian workers around the world sent $69 billion back home -- and 19% of those remittances went to Kerala, the highest proportion of any state, according to India's Central Bank. But Kurian points out that if some of Kerala's overseas workers have now lost their jobs, that could impact Kerala's overall economy.  ""Kerala is best practice sponsored by the rest of the world,"" he said. ""The money that is supporting Kerala's public sector response, that tap has been turned off.""  But Sadanandan is more optimistic -- he thinks the same prevention strategy that worked before can continue to work now.  ""If prevention works with one, it can work with millions,"" he said. ""There would be hiccups but I expect the inherent strength of Kerala to survive the threat."""

12,"Quibi, Netflix's weirdest rival, is off to a rough start","The streaming service, which offers mobile videos and series that are cut into segments shorter than 10 minutes , garnered a lot of attention when it launched on April 6 . But the payoff has been muted, and the service's growth is anemic.  Jeffrey Katzenberg, Quibi's founder, told the New York Times on Monday that he attributes ""everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus... But we own it.""  Yet Meg Whitman, Quibi's CEO, struck a different tone when speaking with CNN Business Monday night. Whitman said she's happy with the service's performance so far.  ""You have to remember, we're a new brand with original content, a new tech platform that was built from the ground up,"" Whitman said. ""We came to market with no library, no legacy product and we're starting from scratch.""  Quibi has roughly 1.3 million active users -- a tiny base compared to more than 50 million Disney+ customers and 183 million Netflix users. And most of Quibi's customers are in the 90-day free trial period. Afterward, the service costs $4.99 a month with ads, and $7.99 a month without. (Quibi is available only in the United States and Canada, while Disney+ and Netflix are global brands.)  eBay EBAY Netflix NFLX Whitman, who is the former CEO ofand HP, argues that growth in the streaming world always takes time, going back to the early days ofor Hulu -- and finding an audience is decidedly more difficult right now.  ""I know how hard it is to gain people's attention, particularly in a pandemic,"" she said. ""But I feel really good about where we are, even though we're five weeks old.""  Yet other streaming services have thrived with people being stuck at home. Netflix reported a huge bump in subscribers last month  A difficult time to launch  As for Katzenberg, he told the Times that he's unhappy with the company's results so far.  ""Is it the avalanche of people that we wanted and were going for out of launch?"" he said. ""The answer is no. It's not up to what we wanted. It's not close to what we wanted.""  Since it was announced, Quibi has been seen as a risky proposition  Its sales pitch was different than most streaming services in that it offered easily digestible content that came with high production budgets, and all of it could only be watched on a mobile phone.  Disney DIS The company courted A-list talent like Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Lopez and raised over $1.75 billion in funding from investors like, CNN's parent company WarnerMedia and the e-commerce company Alibaba.  Quibi was ultimately meant to be a service for users on the go, which is a selling point that disappeared after coronavirus forced people to stay inside.  However, Quibi has other fundamental issues beyond coronavirus, according to Michael Goodman, director of TV and media strategies at Strategy Analytics.  ""It's not really unexpected that Quibi has a rough start,"" Goodman told CNN Business. ""Being a mobile-only streaming service was always a risky bet. I mean, most services are multi-platform and consumers have made it clear that they don't want to be dictated to in how they watch entertainment. The coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the underlying issues that Quibi has as a service.""  Rocky start  Quibi called the lawsuit meritless. ""As we made clear in our filing, Quibi's patented Turnstyle feature is the result of the work from our talented engineering team,"" a Quibi spokesperson said in a statement. ""When a new product launches, these types of claims are unfortunately too common.""  So to say it's been a rough start is an understatement, but it's unclear if Quibi is suffering from the pandemic or if it's suffering from being Quibi, according to Goodman.  ""Quibi is the outlier in this pandemic among streaming services because other services have seen a boom lately. So is this a product that consumers actually want? That's the question right now,"" he said. ""Time will tell if they can turn it around, and we might not know until the pandemic ends, but I believe they have a really difficult road ahead of them.""  CEO Whitman insists there's a path forward.  ""I think you'll see nice, slow and steady growth as we head through the pandemic. And then maybe when we get to the other side of the pandemic, we'll see some accelerating growth,"" Whitman said. ""That's my expectation. I feel pretty good about that."""
13,"No one is buying pants, but pajama sales are soaring","New York (CNN Business) Coronavirus has upended the way people shop, sparking serious deals for some items -- an hefty price increases for others.  Online purchases rocketed higher last month, according to an Adobe Analytics study released Thursday. That's not a huge surprise: Many people can't or don't want to leave home to shop during the pandemic.  The massive boost in online buying turned April into a giant Black Friday sale, Adobe Analytics said. For some retailers, online traffic rivaled the day after Thanksgiving. Other companies heavily discounted items that haven't sold well during the pandemic, giving customers Black-Friday-like deals.  Apparel  Working from home in the coronavirus age means Americans are buying a lot more groceries and far fewer pants online.  To persuade customers to shop, online clothing stores dropped their prices to the floor. Clothing stores were forced to slash prices by an average of 12% between March and April -- the largest monthly price decrease on record for Adobe Analytics.  That helped boost apparel sales, which rose 34% over the same period,  ""We've never seen anything like that for us for apparel,"" said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst for the Adobe digital insights group. ""Right now [apparel companies] are experiencing the kind of pricing that they'd normally get during Black Friday.""  Many major apparel retailers were forced to close physical stores because of stay-at-home orders. Americans who don't have to travel to work also don't need to buy clothes to wear to the office, the gym, or to other social outings.  That helped boost pajama sales by 143% but fueled a 13% sales decline for pants, Adobe Analytics said. The price for bras also dropped by 12%.  A picture of the exterior of a New York City H&M store.  H&M, Adidas and many other retailers reported devastating sales declines during the past several months. S&P Global Market Intelligence also cited a third fewer apparel exports from China during the pandemic.  Soaring sales  Overall, ecommerce sales were up 49% last month, and categories such as online grocery, electronics and books doubled.  Adobe Analytics, which aggregates and analyzes more than a trillion data points from digital retailers that use its software -- including 80 of the top 100 ecommerce sites -- found online grocery store sales surged by 110% between March and April, according to data provided to CNN Business.  Creative audio equipment and alcohol sellers also experienced an e-commerce boom last month, according to Adobe Analytics.  The research group found collective online sales for wine, beer, and spirits surged 74% between March 11 and April 21. The sale of creative audio equipment like microphones and sound mixers rose a whopping 459% in April, according to Pandya, the Adobe Analytics lead analyst.  ""I'd attribute that to people wanting to express creativity at this time,"" Pandya said. ""When people realize they're going to be in quarantine for an extended period of time, they reckon with that.""  That soaring demand has led to some serious price increases for some online items. Prices of electronics, in particular, have risen: Computer prices soared 3.1% last month. Toys were 1.5% more expensive in April than in March. That trend upends years of precedent in which the best deals were found on ecommerce platforms, such as Amazon.  But those sales gains weren't enough to erase the overall losses major retailers have experienced from an economic downturn that has Americans shopping less overall, noted Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst with Forrester.  ""It will take a long time for sales to get back to normal and for people to feel comfortable heading back to stores,"" Kodali said. ""We are in the midst of a recession, possibly a depression. If there's a nonessential retailer that can thrive in that retail environment, I want to know who they are."""

The decision reflects how some measures implemented to deal with the pandemic could lead to a new normal for corporate America, even after the immediate health crisis.  Twitter TWTR did not specify which roles will qualify for the treatment. But the company said the experience of working from home for the past several months has shown that it can work at scale.

""If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it's safe to return.""  The company does not expect to open most of its offices, or support business travel, before September. It has also canceled all of its internal company events through 2020, and could potentially extend that into 2021, the statement said.  Read More"
15,"Report: LeBron, Giannis, Steph Curry, More Stars in Favor of NBA Resuming Season","Jesse D. Garrabrant/Getty Images  LeBron James and the biggest stars in the NBA have reportedly ""formed a united front to resume the 2019-20 season,"" which has been on hiatus because of the coronavirus, according to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports.  NBPA President and Oklahoma City Thunder guard Chris Paul arranged a private conference call Monday that reportedly included James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook.  ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Tuesday the NBPA was polling players about whether they wanted the season to continue.  The players' association denied the report and said it ""has not authorized any formal poll of its players,"" per Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic.  The league has been patient about a potential return, with Commissioner Adam Silver reportedly saying a decision didn't need to be made in May, per Wojnarowski.  Teams were allowed to reopen facilities last week, though some organizations must remain closed for at least several more weeks based on local restrictions.  Some team executives and agents have reportedly called for the NBA to cancel the remainder of the season, according to Jabari Young of CNBC.  However, there is at least some support among players to return and determine a champion.  The stars on the call carry a lot of weight with 71 combined All-Star appearances and nine MVP awards among the nine players Hayes listed.  Though James and Antetokounmpo would have a lot to gain with a return—the Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks would be expected to contend for the title—that's not the case with all the others. Curry and Lillard are on teams that would not currently land in the playoff field, while Durant hasn't played all season while recovering from an Achilles injury.  As Haynes noted, a canceled season could have lasting effects regarding the collective bargaining agreement.  This group of high-profile players could help push the league toward a restart."
16,Woj: NBA Discussed Comfort with a Few Positive Tests Not Derailing Return,"Jae C. Hong/Associated Press  NBA Commissioner Adam Silver reportedly discussed a number of topics regarding the league's potential return during a call with the Board of Governors on Tuesday.  ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the news, noting attendees left ""feeling positive about momentum toward an NBA return to play this season."" However, part of the conversation was about how the league and its players will need to accept the reality that some positive tests for COVID-19 would not shut down the league if it does finish the 2019-20 season and playoffs.  Silver said if one test would ""shut us down, we probably shouldn't go down this path,"" described a centralized location for playing games as a ""campus environment"" and is looking at how other sports leagues both inside and outside the United States are working toward returning to play amid the coronavirus pandemic, per Wojnarowski.  The report also noted the league will study factors such as developments in testing and the trajectory of new cases for the next two-to-four weeks before making a final decision on returning.  This comes after Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported both the league and its players association planned on conducting a call Tuesday that included Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Jayson Tatum and Kyle Lowry, among other players, to discuss potentially finishing the season.  Charania noted the players association ""sent a memo to agents stating sense is players and NBA both want to finish the 2019-20 season.""  Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reported Paul, who is the president of the players association, organized a private conference call Monday with some of the league's most notable players such as LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Westbrook, Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard.  Those stars agreed they want to play again if there are safety measures in place, although Haynes cited sources who said ""the majority of players"" on those teams not in playoff contention prefer a restart that jumps straight into the playoffs.  While teams were permitted to reopen facilities last week, a number of organizations have not done so because of local restrictions in place.  Wojnarowski reported Monday that the NBA is looking at a ""really dire"" financial outlook with play suspended, especially since fans may not be in attendance at games into the 2020-21 season. If that becomes the case, the league and players association may have to ""reconfigure the elements of the CBA."""

The 33-year-old also works as a physician assistant, and she has been working 12-hour shifts for the last three months in the emergency room at Regional Medical Center in San Jose, California, during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, according to the Los Angeles Times' Kevin Baxter.  ""Neither field is really black or white,"" Koroleva told Baxter. ""There are pathways we take based on gut instinct that are largely dependent on previous knowledge and understanding the situation.""  She added: ""It was a very hectic time. We opened a separate COVID area to separate patients with concerning symptoms. And there was a constant changing of requirements and guidelines by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention].""  Baxter noted that Koroleva cared for as many as 10 patients per day.

18,China's CCTV Reiterates It Has No Intention of Airing NBA Games,"Uncredited/Associated Press  Should the 2019-20 NBA season resume, China's state-owned television network will continue to freeze out the league because of Daryl Morey's tweet in support of pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.  NBA China hired Michael Ma as its chief executive officer Tuesday. His father, Ma Guoli, was a top executive for CCTV Sports, an arm of the country's TV network.  ""Michael Ma's hiring led to speculation in China that the connection could help lead to the NBA getting back on the television giant after they've been off the air all season,"" ESPN's Brian Windhorst wrote.  However, Windhorst pointed to a statement from CCTV in which it said it was ""reiterating its consistent stance on national sovereignty.""  The fallout from Morey's tweet was swift and far-reaching. The NBA's official partners in China all suspended their deals with the league, and CCTV declined to broadcast any regular-season games.  NBA commissioner Adam Silver confirmed Chinese government officials also asked for Morey to be fired. Silver issued a statement saying the NBA wasn't going to punish team or league personnel for exercising opinions on political issues:  ""It is inevitable that people around the world -- including from America and China -- will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.  ""However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.""  The frayed relations with China have hit the NBA's bank account. Silver told reporters in February the league wasn't going to lose $1 billion in revenue, as had been reported, and that it's ""probably less than $400 million, maybe even less than that.""  Still, that's a significant amount of money, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further clouded the NBA's financial outlook.  Navigating the pandemic is enough of a headache for Silver and NBA executives. Repairing the league's partnerships in China looms on the horizon as well."
19,Kobe Bryant-Partnered 'Mamba Sports Academy' Rebranded as 'Sports Academy',"Stefanie Dazio/Associated Press  The Mamba Sports Academy announced Tuesday it will revert to its original name, Sports Academy, after its partnership with the family of Kobe Bryant ended after 14 months of ""extraordinary"" success.  In a statement, the company said:  ""Like tens of millions of fans around the globe, Sports Academy's world drastically changed on Jan. 26, 2020. Today, with respect for an unparalleled legacy, the Academy will retire the 'Mamba' in the Mamba Sports Academy name—to raise it to the rafters, where it belongs. In doing so, Sports Academy will carry on the vision it curated during that special partnership.""  Bryant died in a helicopter crash in California on Jan. 26.  He partnered with Sports Academy CEO Chad Faulkner in 2018 to help create a ""full-circle facility"" dedicated to maximizing human performance.  The company, which was founded by Faulkner in 2016, was rebranded based on the ""Mamba Mentality,"" a term Bryant used throughout his career to help explain how he became one of the best players in NBA history.  ""Mamba Mentality isn't about seeking a result. It's about the journey and the approach. It's a way of life,"" the five-time NBA champion said.  He served as coach of the academy's girls basketball team that featured his daughter Gianna Bryant, who also died in January's crash.  Although the partnership has ended, the company said its ""mission remains unchanged."""

Around the world, some governments are beginning to slowly relax their social-distancing restrictions.  Most countries have taken measures to protect against the spread of Covid-19: enforcing stay-at-home orders, closing nonessential businesses and advising people to wear protective gear and keep a safe distance from one another.  Many of those guidelines still apply. But beaches are beginning to reopen, some students are returning to classrooms, and businesses are opening their doors for the first time in weeks."

Worshippers are being advised to pray at home.  Other mosques are trying to practice social distancing."
22,Australian lawmaker tested for Covid-19 after coughing fit in parliament,"(CNN) An Australian lawmaker has been tested for Covid-19 after a coughing fit in parliament on Tuesday made it difficult for him to finish his speech.  Video footage shows Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg having to pause several times to get his breath back, taking sips of water in a bid to reclaim his voice.  ""I'm lucky I have some water,"" he said, coughing. ""Too long of a speech.""  Frydenberg said it would take years to pay back money borrowed to fight coronavirus.  Frydenberg later revealed that he had entered self-isolation and was tested for coronavirus, according to CNN affiliate 9News.  ""Today while delivering my ministerial statement I had a dry mouth and a cough,"" said Frydenberg in a statement seen by 9News."
23,The 34 most staggering lines from Donald Trump's Rose Garden press conference,"(CNN) President Donald Trump sought to preempt potentially damaging congressional testimony Tuesday on the state of testing and the reopening of the country by taking to the Rose Garden Monday afternoon to make a series of incorrect claims about the ongoing fight against coronavirus. He also continued his ongoing war with the media.  I went through the transcript and pulled out the lines you should see. They're below.  In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!  1. ""We're here today to provide an update on the unprecedented testing capacity developed by the United States, the most advanced and robust testing system anywhere in the world, by far.""  2. ""We have really had a very good relationship with the states and the governors and other representatives within the states, a relationship.""  ""She's not stepping up. All she does is sit there and blame the federal government. She doesn't get it done. And we send her a lot."" -- Donald Trump on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer  ""Governor Cuomo should spend more time 'doing' and less time 'complaining'. Get out there and get the job done."" -- Donald Trump on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo  ""@JBPritzker, Governor of Illinois, and a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News @CNN & Concast (MSDNC), shouldn't be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings."" -- Donald Trump on Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker  3. ""It should have never been allowed to happen; it should have been stopped at the source.""  This is a common line for Trump now as he seeks to lay blame for coronavirus on the Chinese and their demonstrated lack of transparency in terms of the virus and its initial spread. At the same time, it seems a lot to ask of any country to ""stop"" a virus with the level of transmissibility that Covid-19 has. After all, the US knew the virus was headed our way for months and we now have more than 1 million cases and more than 80,000 dead  4. ""In every generation, through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task. We have met the moment and we have prevailed.""  Worth noting that the latest IHME model projects more than 134,000 American deaths by early August. Which would mean that roughly 53,000 people will die between today and August 4. Those people don't likely believe that ""we have prevailed.""  5. ""In the fourth quarter we're going to do very good and next year I think we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had because there's a tremendous pent-up demand.""  Worth noting this is a timeline change for Trump. He had long insisted that the economy would immediately bounce back once the country began reopening. He is now suggesting that it won't be until 2021 when things will truly recover.  6. ""I've felt things a lot over my life and I've made a lot of good calls.""  [opens mouth to say something, decides against it]  7. ""But we're transitioning to greatness and the greatness is going to be in the fourth quarter but it's really going to be next year and it's going to be a year like we've never had before.""  A lot of people focus on the fourth quarter. But it's the fifth quarter that really matters! That's where greatness is most effectively transitioned  8. ""We had the best economy in the history of the world, not just here but anywhere in the world.""  9. ""We had the best economy anywhere in the world and we were going for numbers, whether it was unemployment numbers where we had our best numbers. Employment also numbers. Little different.""  10. ""Now we had one of the best weeks in the history of our border between the United States and Mexico, our southern border. We had very few people coming in, very, very few.""  [raises hand tentatively] Might that slowdown in border crossings be due to the pandemic raging in our country?  11. ""But again, we've had the best numbers.""  Beautiful numbers. The greatest. Many people are saying it.  12. ""It's the hidden enemy. Remember that. It's the hidden enemy. So, things happen.""  ""Things happen."" So true.  13. ""The one who tested positive will be fine, will be absolutely fine.""  14. ""This building is shocking, if you look at the numbers.""  Donald Trump on the White House.  15. ""Very soon. I mean, really, very soon.""  This is Trump's response to a question on when the average person will be able to be tested for coronavirus ""every day as they go back to work."" There is very little evidence that we will have testing for all 160 million working Americans anytime soon. Or even ""very soon.""  16. ""You look at all of these machines here. They're incredible machines, the best anywhere in the world.""  17. ""Other countries are calling, sophisticated countries, and they're calling, lots of countries.""  ""Sophisticated countries,"" you say? Tell me more...  18.""They have learned about -- I see everybody, just about everybody has a face mask on.""  The President wasn't wearing a mask when he said this. And he doesn't plan to wear one . So, yeah.  19. ""They have learned about face masks, the good and the bad, by the way. It's not a one-sided thing, believe it or not.""  Masks can be bad? I suppose Trump is suggesting that people touch their faces more when they wear masks? I truly don't know.  20. ""No, we prevailed on testing is what I'm referring to. That was with regard to testing.""  So, Trump is editing his previous comment -- see No. 4 -- that his comments about having ""prevailed"" was solely about testing not about the broader fight against the virus. Even so, it's very hard to see how we have prevailed on testing -- at least yet.  21. ""And greatness is next year, right from the beginning.""  Mark your calendar: January 1, 2021 is when greatness begins.  22. ""In the case of me, I'm not -- I'm not close to anybody.""  This is Trump's defense for why he isn't wearing a mask. But it's not the real reason he isn't wearing a mask  23.""I understand you very well, better than you understand yourself.""  Did you not know that Trump was a psychiatrist? He already knew you didn't know that, by the way.  24. ""Now that we're doing so well on tests and so quick and so fast, five minutes, et cetera, and so accurate, you're complaining that we're getting too many tests. So you can't win.""  No one in the media is complaining about the number of tests available. The question is -- and has been -- when the average person will have the access to immediate and daily testing like the White House staff does.  25. ""As far as Americans getting a test, they should all be able to get a test right now. They should be able to get a test.""  Whether they ""should"" or not, they aren't.  26. ""They want our country open. I want our country open too. I want it open safely. But I want it open. Don't forget.""  To be clear, almost every single epidemiologist and infectious disease expert has made clear that the more a state reopens its economy, the more likely it is that coronavirus begins spreading rapidly in that state. I suppose this depends on what your meaning of ""safe"" is?  27. ""You can go with the enclosed route. Everything's closed up; you're in your house, you're not allowed to move. People are dying with that, too.""  No state passed any sort of guideline that required people to not be ""allowed to move.""  28. ""The 20,000 [cases] -- the numbers are way down from what they were two weeks ago. I mean, the numbers are really coming down; they're very substantially -- and this weekend was one of the lowest we've had. This is, you know, the numbers are coming down very rapidly -- all throughout the country, by the way.""  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there were more than 23,000 coronavirus cases diagnosed in the US on Sunday, May 10. A week prior -- May 3 -- there were more than 29,000 cases diagnosed. But just two days later, there were just over 22,000 diagnoses of Covid-19. In short, the numbers continue to bounce around a bit. But what's clear is that the numbers aren't coming down ""very rapidly.""  29. ""But as far as the models are concerned, if you go by the model, we were going to lose 2.2 million people.""  This was never going to be true. Not ever  30. ""We're at the lowest of all of the models. I mean, if you look at, I guess that 120,000 -- 100,000 to 120,000 people would be at the low side. And we're at -- there's nothing low.""  ""Now we're going toward 50,000 -- I'm hearing, or 60,000 people. One is too many. I always say it. One is too many, but we're going toward 50,000 or 60,000 people. That's at the lower -- as you know the lower (end of the projections) was supposed to be 100,000 people."" -- Donald Trump, April 21  31. ""You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.""  The question Trump was asked is this: What is the crime that Trump is accusing former President Barack Obama of committing ? And Trump's answer, of course, is not an answer at all. Because there is no crime. Or at least not one he -- or anyone else -- has elucidated.  32. ""Well they're losing their lives everywhere in the world and maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me, ask China that question, OK? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer.""  In which the President of the United States tells CBS News' Weijia Jiang, who was born in China but immigrated to the US at age 2, that she should ask China her question about why he is casting testing capacity as a global competition. Jiang replied by asking why Trump was ""saying that to me specifically, that I should ask China?"" To which Trump responded: ""I'm telling you -- I'm not saying it's specifically to anybody, I'm saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that."" Of course, he didn't say it to just anybody. He said it to a Chinese-American reporter. And if you think that was by accident, you haven't been paying attention for the past three years.  33. ""I did and you didn't respond and now I'm calling on the young lady in the back. Please?""  Trump called on CNN's Kaitlan Collins . Then he decided he didn't want her to ask a question. That's all that happened here.  34. ""OK. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, appreciate it. Thank you very much.""  And then Trump decided to just end the press conference -- mere seconds after he had called on Kaitlan and then the ""young lady in the back."" So, yeah, this feels like a good place to end."
24,"Trump says the US leads the world in testing. But it's far behind in testing per capita, studies show","""AMERICA LEADS THE WORLD IN TESTING""  ""We've prevailed on testing,"" Trump said Monday, standing between the signs.  While the US may have performed the most number of coronavirus tests, it's nowhere near the world's leader in testing per capita, multiple studies show.  And health experts say the US isn't close to the rate of testing needed to safely reopen the economy.  How many tests have been done?  By May 12, the US had conducted about 9.6 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project  As of May 11, the US has performed an average of 28.24 tests per 1,000 people, according to researchers from Oxford University  It's important to note some individuals have received multiple tests. For example, Vice President Mike Pence cited his frequent testing as a reason why he chose not to wear a face mask.  Public health experts say we don't need to test every American right now. But they say the US still isn't conducting enough tests to stop the spread of the virus enough to safely reopen the economy.  ""This is due to a growing consensus among experts that the US is faring worse in this outbreak than previously thought,"" the institute said. ""Social distancing measures have been able to stall the sharp increase of infection and death rates -- but unlike in many other nations, new cases are only very slowly decreasing.""  On Monday, Trump said the US is conducting about 300,000 tests per day.  How does the US stack up against other countries?  There's no single definitive ranking system because there are variations in how some countries report their testing.  ""The number of tests does not refer to the same in each country -- one difference is that some countries report the number of people tested, while others report the number of tests (which can be higher if the same person is tested more than once),"" the Oxford researchers said on their website OurWorldInData.org  So CNN looked at different rankings, and each study showed that many other countries have higher per capita testing rates.  As of April 26, the US ranked 22nd in the number of tests performed per capita, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  FactCheck.org , a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at Trump's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump's April claim about the US testing more than ""every country combined"" was ""way off.""  ""The U.S. total is indeed more than any single country has reportedly done -- but not more than all other countries combined,"" FactCheck.org said.  ""Adding together just the number of tests conducted by Russia, Germany and Italy -- the next three countries that have done the most testing -- would produce a higher figure. ... So, Trump's claim is not even close to being accurate.""  Republican senators say testing is still insufficient  Lawmakers have urged the administration to keep ramping up testing to help states allow businesses and schools to open.  ""All roads back to work and back to school run through testing. And that what our country has done so far on testing is impressive, but not nearly enough,"" Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said Tuesday.  Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, questioned the administration's touting of conducting more tests than South Korea, including more tests per capita than South Korea  And while South Korea has kept its Covid-19 deaths under 300, Romney noted, the US death toll is more than 82,000 and climbing  ""I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever,"" Romney said. ""The fact is (South Korea's) test numbers are going down, down, down now because they don't have the kind of outbreak now. Ours are going up, up, up, because they have to."""

2,The speech Modi has not made but should,"Beloved brothers and sisters,  We have been struck by the worst tragedy since Independence. We shall overcome, with courage and resilience. But we must also change course in the light of experience.  Colleagues and experts advised me to announce a Rs 20 lakh crore package spread over every possible vote bank. I was sceptical. For instance, providing Rs 3,500 crore for the relief of migrant workers sounded good, yet meant just Rs 250 each for 14 crore migrant workers, half the minimum daily wage in major cities. All the new financial measures will not prevent bank bad debts from doubling.  I was advised to finance the package through the RBI, banks, concessions and promises, not budgetary borrowing. Experts said our fiscal situation was perilous, and rating agencies might downgrade India to junk status if it announced a big fiscal rescue. Advisors also suggested gradual re-opening of the economy, keeping hot spots mostly shut.  After much thought, I have rejected this approach. Let us be strong and not dictated to by rating agencies, especially since other emerging markets are far worse off. The foreign direct investment we seek is not driven by credit ratings. So, I have decided to boldly expand the fiscal deficit by 5% of GDP to help needy people and enterprises. RBI will print the required sums.  Many measures suggested by my advisors are sensible. Others are just spin, reflect decisions already announced or expand ongoing schemes. That’s okay, good politics tries to raise morale at minimal fiscal cost.  The fundamental problem is that we are being ravaged not so much by Covid as our own lockdowns. The cure is proving worse than the disease. Lockdowns are killing enterprises, livelihoods and people on a massive scale. By contrast, Covid deaths are under 3,000, against 80,000 in the USA.  Alas, this is not because we are world leaders in prevention or containment. Millions of households sleep four or more people per room, making isolation and social distancing difficult. Our low fatality rate may reflect resistance got from dozens of other rampant diseases, from TB and flu to measles and pertussis. Maybe we get resistance from high temperatures, or from the most polluted air and water in the world.  Bottom line: fatality numbers today make Covid look only a modest health risk. Yet to combat it, we have imposed terrible misery through draconian shutdowns. Ten million Indians die every year of various causes. TB alone claims 450,000. We do not respond by locking down the economy: we learn to live with the diseases.  Covid was initially feared to be as infectious as the Spanish flu of 2018 that killed millions. But today, India’s Covid fatality rate is peanuts. This may partly reflect incomplete data, partly the lockdown’s effect. But maybe we have also been guilty of panicky over-reaction to a not-so-deadly virus.  Every death is a tragedy, but a Covid death is not more tragic than a TB or influenza death. Since we live with those, why not with Covid too? Soumya Swaminathan of the World Health Organisation warns that we may have no choice: we may never have a fully effective vaccine for Covid, as is true of HIV and influenza. We may ultimately have to live with all these diseases.  Critics say that other developing countries have announced a bigger stimulus up to 20% of GDP. This is misleading. Despite additional government spending, the GDP of these countries is crashing, so they are more sedated than stimulated. Lesson: the biggest and only sustainable stimulus is to get the economy to boom again, and that means phasing out lockdowns.  This will carry risks of Covid spreading. But in any case, it will eventually spread till we get ‘herd immunity’. Our policy of lockdowns in red zones is not working. The number of red zones seems to be expanding fast — from 130 to 180 districts that create two-thirds of GDP — and the answer cannot be to keep extending lockdowns. We must revive economic growth.  Let us shift focus from lockdowns that hurt a billion people to massive testing, tracing and isolating Covid-infected people. This will require a major change of mindset and administrative effort. In our crowded conditions, I fear we will meet only with partial success. But when no ideal solutions exist, let us shift from seriously flawed lockdowns to less flawed measures.  Beloved brothers and sisters, a great calamity has laid low all countries, even the mightiest. Let us not worsen that calamity through panicky over-reaction that is costlier than the disease. Changing course entails sacrifices. But deep in my heart, I do believe that we shall overcome some day."
3,"In an increasingly selfish world, self-reliance is the only route for India","The Great War of 1914-18 that led to more than 20 million deaths, changed international politics unrecognisably and triggered another, more horrible World War 21 years later, began with the brinkmanship of great powers going awry. However, when it began in August 1914 with jingoistic fanfare all over Europe, few people anticipated its devastating magnitude. Indeed, the conventional wisdom was that the boys would be home for Christmas.  History may or may not repeat itself this year. The global war against what Boris Johnson described as the “devilish illness” may be another transformative moment. Alternatively, it could be — to borrow historian A J P Taylor’s phrase — another “turning point” when “history refused to turn”.  The signs, alas, are ominous. Last Thursday, WHO dashed hopes of life returning to pre-March 25 normal when it announced that Covid-19 “may just become another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away.” Unless some scientist stumbles into discovering a wonder vaccine, the world is destined to live with a permanent uncertainty of infection and, possibly, premature death. Just when human endeavour seemed to have pierced the frontiers of knowledge, the virus from Wuhan has stepped in to invoke the pre-modern fear of the unknown.  Whether PM Narendra Modi had been alerted to WHO’s admission of failure before his address on May 12 is unknown. His passing reference to having to live with the pandemic may suggest he was. What is, however, clear is that rather than joining in the dejection that this global setback is likely to produce — the WHO has already warned of the grave impact on the “mental health and wellbeing of whole societies” — he has chosen to plan for India’s future in the corona-infested world. His prescriptions may not be gospel and adjustments will possibly have to be made to cope with newer challenges. But at a moment when people are grappling for direction and both hope reassurance and hope, he has at least come out with a mission statement of the road ahead. In wartime, people expect decisive leadership. Modi has risen to the occasion.  At the heart of his approach is a belief that India has the resolve and resilience to cope with the disruption the pandemic is certain to create. The prolonged lockdown has led to enormous hardships and even trauma, particularly for those who were left stranded and jobless. However, considering the sheer scale of the exercise and that it had to be undertaken in extreme haste, the compliance has been awesome. True, there have been cases of truant behaviour — West Bengal is a sad example — but overall India’s record of 2,760 deaths and 86,678 infections (as of May 16) is worthy of appreciation. Sceptics in the West have been disabused of their fear that India will see a replay of the mass deaths that characterised famines of yesteryears. Of course, this can still happen if people lower their guard after May 18.  Secondly, stemming from this belief that India can rise to the challenge is the assumption that in the coming days the world will become incredibly selfish. America has eschewed its global role; Europe is pulling in conflicting directions; and China’s power is laced with menacing connotations. The vision of a globalised world has crashed. Even the opportunities for Indians in West Asia are certain to shrink dramatically, affecting remittances.  In such a situation, there is no alternative to India bolstering its own capacity and aiming for maximum self-reliance. This is not a prescription for insularity, but a process of pragmatic adjustment based on the conviction that India’s future cannot be based on either someone else’s benevolence or abject subordination. Yes, Modi’s prescription is unabashedly nationalistic and technocentric. There are obvious parallels with Japan, but minus the aggressive militarism that marred its pre-1945 enterprise. India’s outreach has to be visibly benign and based on soft power.  The challenges before India in this uncertain world are daunting and they must be navigated with caution and nimbleness. But the real challenge is internal. To achieve his objective or even come close to achieving it, Modi has to first motivate Indians into believing in themselves. This involves shedding the culture of sloth, ossified thinking, red tape and negativism that, unfortunately, has prevented India from realising its full potential. The challenge is economic, human and intellectual. It is not enough to invite the world to Make in India; there has to be a corresponding pride in the excellence of Made in India."
4,A letter of apology to the migrants who made our homes & highways,"Dear Jamlo Makdam,  This letter of apology will never reach you. You perished last month. You were walking from a Telangana chilli farm to your home in a Chhattisgarh village. Your 12-year-old exhausted legs could not carry you for all those hundreds of kilometres in the scorching sun.  Yours is not the only tragedy. A database — Thejesh GN — shows that until May 11, while walking thousands of kilometres towards home, 29 have died of exhaustion and 83 have died in accidents on the road. This week, 17 died in 24 hours, hit by speeding trucks on the highway. In Aurangabad, train tracks have turned red with blood — 16 weary workers, walking from Maharashtra towards Madhya Pradesh, lay down to doze off on the tracks. The people felt the elevation of the tracks would protect them from wild animals but were cut down by a goods train. With public transport cruelly shut off, workers even piled into an airless concrete mixer to travel some distance towards home.  We, the so-called urban middle class, the prosperous, the educated, have collectively failed you. We are the beneficiaries of the new economy, we are the aspirational Indians, we love our malls, our penthouses, our swimming pools. You built all of these, yet we could not see you. You were invisible to us, hidden away behind the metallic jungle of scaffolding. Today you walk on the six-lane highways you built for our SUVs.  We see the bewildered pain in your eyes. It makes us realise that however much charity we throw at you, make you line up for food packets or herd you into camps, we can never make up for the fact that all of us — politicians and civil society alike — have snatched away the most fundamental of all democratic rights: your self-respect, your dignity. As skilled breadwinners, asking for food is terrible humiliation.  You built our houses, but we never asked that you get low-cost housing. We have never demanded that you get any form of social security. As we gazed out of our skyscrapers at the slums outside, we wanted to blank you out and pretend you weren’t there. We wanted slums to be demolished, or to build walls between us and you.  What did we argue in our defence? We have no powers, what can the helpless middle class do, given the scale of the deprivation? It’s the state and the politician, surely, who must be the provider.  But sadly, most politicians couldn’t care less. Politicians have always seen you as a vote bank, regularising slum colonies only before elections but making little effort to provide basic amenities.  Promises of Swachh Bharat were made, but the website Indiaspend records that in 2015-16, 10% of urban households mostly in slum colonies, still practised open defecation because of lack of access to functioning toilets.  If the politicians ignored you, so did civil society. Yes, workers who were earlier called “maidservants” are now called “domestic help”, but the change in nomenclature has hardly resulted in a change in mindset. Across middle-class India, the relationship with domestic workers continues to be exploitative and transactional. RWAs have attempted to stop domestic helps from coming to work as they fear they are corona carriers, ignoring the fact that most of those who carry the virus are those who have travelled abroad.  We speak imperiously of social distancing, but such measures are meaningless for families living in 6×8 feet tenements. For many of “us”, the lockdown is almost an elite privilege: we can catch up on Netflix shows and learn new hobbies. Today the international buzzword is work from home (WFH), but for you the construction site was your home. You lived in dark, dingy, temporary basements while building gleaming mansions. What does WFH mean to you?  Sooner or later the lockdown will end and workers from villages will once again stream back to the city. Will they be condemned to the same lives living without proper shelter or security? Surely, it’s time for a new contract between “you” and “us”, for a new relationship, a new way of looking at each other. There can be no going back.  You cannot go back to being simply statistics without faces or names. Greater institutional protection is an urgent necessity. It’s time “we” recognise your legal constitutional status as citizens equal to “us”, in no way lesser, however ragged your clothes.  Perhaps that would be the best way to remember you, Jamlo Makdam, and to seek your forgiveness. You, the lonely 12-year-old, who died walking hundreds of kilometres to somehow reach your mother."
5,"We don’t have to defeat Covid, we need to make peace with it","Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally told the nation something that would have been good to hear a month or more back.  He said “Friends, experts and scientists have pointed out that corona will remain a part of our lives for a long time. But at the same time, we cannot allow our lives to only be confined to corona. We should wear masks, follow social distancing and pursue our goals.”  Unfortunately, until this point we have treated corona as an enemy that had to be defeated, drummed out of India, its tail between its legs. When Mr Modi asked Indians to bang pots and pans to thank doctors and medical staff fighting against corona, his more ardent supporters claimed the sound waves would dispel the virus. When the Prime Minister asked us to light diyas for 9 minutes from 9pm, a slew of WhatsApp messages insisted that thanks to the heat generated corona would die at 9.09pm that Sunday. There have been many Sundays since then. Covid-19 is very much around and the Prime Minister is talking about Lockdown IV.  Of course deep down we all knew the virus would not obey our lockdown calendar. The lockdown was not a silver bullet. It bought medical facilities time. It allowed India to ramp up on its supplies of PPE kits and N95 masks. But it was a wasted opportunity in terms of teaching us how to live in a post-lockdown world where Covid-19 would still be a reality, undeterred by the sound and light show of the bartan orchestra and candlelight vigils. “In these flu-like epidemics there is a huge wave and then it lingers on for years together,” says Dr Pratima Murthy, head of psychiatry at NIMHANS. “So I think we need to adjust to a life where we manage ourselves in a sensible manner but we go about our work.” That messaging that would have gone a long way in reassuring an anxious citizenry that it is possible to navigate a normal world where we get our root canals done and our plumbing fixed and meet a friend despite Covid. And a Covid diagnosis should not mean neighbourhood panic and instant stigma.  Rarely has a government had our collective attention as completely as it did during the long weeks of this lockdown. If Indians had emerged from the lockdown knowing how to wear and wash a mask properly that would have been time well-spent. If we had been given clear messaging about how to sanitise vegetables we bought at the bazaar that would have been useful. If we had been taught a basic “sanitisation drill” to follow when we return from work that would have been reassuring. A lot of our anxiety around Covid-19 stems from the fact that we do not understand what we need to do to keep our families safe. We are petrified that we will inadvertently bring the virus home in a post-lockdown world. And while politicians talk about defeating the virus, the rest of us are scouring survival tips from WhatsApp University. Someone is sunning their newspapers all day. Someone is scrubbing vegetables with Vim bars. Someone is spraying eau de cologne on currency notes. Someone is swearing by gaumutra as a Covid-blocker. And then there are thousands of Indians crammed in the back of trucks, just trying to get back home, handkerchiefs around their faces — a threadbare defense against a virulent pandemic.  This could have been the time for the government to try and get out messaging that answered these questions, lessened the stigma around those testing positive or at least kicked off these conversations. Instead we rained flower petals from fighter jets. Now Covid looms beyond the lockdown like the undead.  The tragedy is that in an era of strongmen leaders around the world, we only seem to understand a war metaphor when it comes to confronting great challenges. But Covid-19 is not Pakistan, an old enemy to be vanquished. We might want to think of a pandemic as a World War but there will be no Treaty of Versailles that will mark the end of the lockdown. One day hopefully there will be a vaccine or herd immunity. But WHO emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan warns that the virus “may never go away” just as measles persists despite a vaccine. “HIV has not gone away — but we have come to terms with the virus,” he says. We don’t have to win the war against Covid as much as we need to learn to make peace with its existence in our world for now. It might help to remember what Leo Tolstoy wrote: “The strongest of all warriors are these two — Time and Patience.” The name of the book? War and Peace."
6,"Decoding economic revival package: Factoring in limited fiscal space, it bets on enhanced credit flows as a trigger","In order to get a feel of the contours of the government’s Rs 20 lakh crore revival package, it is useful to understand the circumstances in which it is being announced. First, with the most optimistic predictions pegging GDP growth at barely over 1% for 2020-21 – compared to 5% in the previous year – a stimulus is imperative. Second, with slow economic growth over the last couple of years pulling tax collections down, the government has limited “fiscal space”. This means it can’t prime the economic pump through a massive increase in spending or a cut in taxes.  Third, monetary policy is doing what it can to stave off a collapse by flooding the economy with cash. Since 27 March, the RBI has through different sluices released Rs 525,000 crore of liquidity into the financial system. Banks, however, fear a rise in defaults due to the economic downturn and are shying away from channelling this liquidity to sectors that need it the most. They prefer instead to park their money with the RBI itself resulting in “reverse repo balances” of over Rs 800,000 crore a day on average.  Fourth, the worst affected by the collapse in growth are the small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and India’s shadow banks or NBFCs that cater to their financial needs. While MSMEs are collectively one of the biggest employers with about 120 million workers on their rolls, they are also considered by banks to be the riskiest borrowers.  This is not because Covid has singled them out for punishment. MSMEs have been skating on thin ice since demonetisation in 2016 and the introduction of GST the following year. The implosion of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (ILFS) in mid 2018 dealt a body blow to the NBFCs from which they did not quite recover. Covid has simply made things worse.  Finally, the pandemic hurts both demand and supply. Locking down is a sledgehammer blow to supply chains and hence downstream final production. A collapse in supply affects in turn the capacity to earn incomes and hits demand hard. A worker who is laid off will focus on ensuring a bare subsistence; the entrepreneur saddled with a loss will put off his decision to buy a new car. Discretionary spending plummets.  Add to this the fact that households are known to ratchet their precautionary savings up and reduce consumption in the wake of crises and you get a situation in which even if supply were to get back on its feet, producers might not find buyers to sell to.  Shorn of the hype and hyperbole, the government’s revival strategy is an “optimal” response to the constraints that this complex mesh of circumstances imposes. To start with, the government hopes that enhanced credit flow can substitute for hard budgetary spending in providing the needed fillip. A large part of the stimulus is really about activating channels of credit. The Rs 300,000 crore collateral free loan facility for MSMEs or the Rs 30,000 crore liquidity facility for NBFCs, mortgage lenders and microfinance institutions announced in the first tranche of the package are examples.  Relying on credit helps in two ways. First, it enables the government to operate within the fiscal confines. Second, it can potentially revive supply by making more working capital (perhaps the most critical input for producers) available and at low interest rates. The bet is that as that supply resumes, it would set off a virtuous cycle. A revival in production would get workers back on payrolls; they would spend more pushing demand up in the process; more demand would call for more supply and so the cycle goes.  How does the government plan to enhance credit flow? After all the decisions to lend lie squarely with banks. The government’s tack is to reduce the risk of loans going bad by turning into a guarantor for borrowers. Thus, behind every effort to get banks to ramp up lending, there is a government backstop – a promise to make good a bank’s losses if a borrower defaults. Guarantees are strange creatures. They are “fiscal” in that the government provides it. Yet they do not involve immediate expenditures and thus no immediate increase to fiscal deficit. They are “contingent liabilities” that need to be paid in future were defaults to happen.  The final assumption in this strategy: while larger firms are better able to look after themselves, it is the MSMEs that need handholding. A large fraction of this credit targeting is thus to MSMEs and their financiers, the NBFCs. An implicit belief is that smaller firms are most likely to deliver economic salvation if they revive. For one they are big employers, and secondly they are indispensable to supply chains that keep the production ecosystem in good fettle.  Stripped to its bare bones, the government’s revival plan is logically consistent. Besides, the fact that other countries such as the US and UK are also placing huge bets on credit flow and guarantees to lift their economies gives it a degree of legitimacy. Critics are however not hard to find. They ask uncomfortable questions about whether the economy has the capacity to absorb so much credit or whether loans rather than conventional fiscal expansion is the right cure. “Parkalam” as the late Congress leader Kamaraj was fond of saying. Let’s see."
7,Reopen now: Kickstarting economy cannot be delayed any longer,"With Lockdown 3.0 on its last legs amid talk of future iterations with fewer controls, it should be left to state governments to decide how they proceed. The outbreak’s intensity and spread are manifesting differently in each state and wide sweeps from New Delhi’s vantage point must yield to decision making by state governments to remedy economic repercussions, closer as they are to ground realities. Freezing economic activity is no longer an option. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has proposed, rightly, that restrictions remain only in containment zones while other places, including markets, reopen.  Colour coded restrictions at district level are far too sweeping and restrictive for any meaningful economic activity to restart. Europe and the United States, despite greater resources, social security cushioning for economic distress and higher incidence of Covid-19 cases, are reopening faster than India after less stringent lockdowns. Neighbouring China made a strong statement throwing open a Disneyland in Shanghai. Meanwhile in India, migrants continue to trudge home on foot thanks to limited transport options.  Containment zones must be sharply defined and thus minimally disruptive for those not in immediate proximity, otherwise entire localities could find themselves locked in again as the Covid trajectory nears peaking point. An open letter from a group of internationally renowned scientists and doctors strongly urges the use of masks to reduce coronavirus transmission, warning that patients are most infectious in the pre-symptomatic stage. Despite masks becoming compulsory, perhaps the most simple workaround we have, people continue to violate the official directive. Governments must get cracking in this direction instead of bureaucratic hair splitting over essential and non-essential commodities/ services, or red, green and orange zones. Low on confidence and ridden by fear psychosis, businesses and citizens emerging from the lockdown will benefit from clear signalling. Eschew long, unwieldy sets of regulations in favour of a minimal number of physical distancing rules."
8,Beauty contest: Lipstick takes the backseat to mascara,"WFH means one can spend the whole day in slippers and pajamas, just keeping the lower body shy of the camera’s gaze during official meetings. This doesn’t work for everyone. Dressing up helps some women feel mentally more at work. But what does one do about the hair? Two months of lockdown mean it is sadly out of style and colour. DIY cuts are hit and miss.  On the upside many women are reporting big improvements in hair quality. Pollution is down. So are blow drying and flat ironing. But desi masks are seriously up. Eggs, olive oil, curd, honey, aloe vera, hibiscus flowers … the locks are getting some A grade conditioning. Skin is a similar story. For many ladies makeup has been the daily pick-me-up but it doesn’t seem worth the effort when they are not going out to meet the world. Skincare, however, can have a much more homely face. From the Japanese Tanaka facial massage to Ayurveda, education is only one click away. Some tender loving self care is a stressbuster. And it puts you in control.  The lipstick index has been used to describe the surge in cosmetic sales during past downturns. But Covid times are seeing the mascara index instead – because our mouths are masked and our eyes centrestage. And finally, even WFH needs sunscreen. Like John Donne wrote, the busy old fool, unruly sun, dost through windows and even through curtains call on us. Beware the wrinkles in its wake."
9,What government agencies can do to ensure safety and security of migrant workers,"Trust deficit among poor people has been quite visible during the Covid-19 outbreak. The painful visuals of helpless poor people going back to their hometowns and villages have raised questions about the government’s timeliness in providing adequate support to migrant workers. By the time the finance minister announced free food grains for the next two months to migrant workers who don’t have ration cards with a financial support of Rs 3,500 crore, most of the workers have either left or are leaving under distressed conditions.  Although government agencies kept promising safety and security of poor people in the cities, it took almost 50 days into the lockdown to announce this and other benefits. Looking at the sluggish implementation mechanism, translation of these packages into actual benefits can take even longer. Many migrant workers have left cities in the absence of food and cash flow into the household.  The government could have gained more trust of these poor folk by acting swiftly and extending confidence not by mere words, but by actually transferring cash into their bank accounts for four to five months and by delivering ration without much hassle. At this time of crisis, the government should have really tried the ‘self-declaration’ approach by poor people to access benefits rather than getting into bureaucratic glitches and doubting the credentials of poor migrant workers, as happened in cities like Delhi.  According to the 2011 Census India has 56 million inter-state migrants, of which 40 million live in urban areas. Of these roughly 34 million work in the informal sector. Roughly 79% of India’s migrants work for daily wages in factories or construction sites. Looking at the recent crisis, the government should seriously consider setting up an Inter-State Migration Council, which can work towards safety, security and welfare of the migrant workers. This council will be able to resolve issues related to inter-state migration.  According to government sources, cash benefits of about Rs 3,000 crore have been given to 2 crore registered construction workers. However, there is a huge discrepancy between actual number of construction workers versus registered workers who are getting benefits from the boards. For example, Delhi government has paid Rs 5,000 to about 40,000 registered workers but the city would have many unregistered construction workers. The registration process in existing boards is very cumbersome. The government must think of ‘self-declaration’ mechanism for all unorganised sector workers by which workers can register themselves easily. Such a mechanism can have provisions attracting punishment, in case of false declaration.  More than 90% of the workforce is active in the unorganised sector in India without any permanent work or social security. Most of them do not have identity proofs which can establish their work status. In 2014, the government had promised to register 47 crore unorganised workers and provide Aadhaar linked non-transferable UWIN (unorganised workers identity card) on the lines of the Gujarat government, but this hasn’t moved beyond a promise.  Availability of such cards can be beneficial for all migrant workers and the government could easily deliver benefits during a crisis. When the government can deliver Aadhaar card to establish unique identity of an individual, and the ‘One nation One ration card’ for ration, this is the right time for a ‘single portable card for workers’ in the informal sector to be initiated. This card can work as an identity card as well as benefit-cum-entitlement card for them.  Both in normal times and during a crisis situation like Covid-19, an organised mechanism to serve the interest of workers can not only regenerate confidence of workers in the system but also drastically improve labour governance in the country. With 38.4% contribution by the informal sector (excluding agriculture) to GDP, more targeted and inclusive policies for the workers here will bring better results for the economy.  If we do not take care of the welfare of migrant workers at the earliest, the pictures of their leaving the cities are going to haunt the country for a longer period. Originating states of migrant workers need to act swiftly by creating income opportunities for them, or else we might face a social upheaval in the coming months. The workers have shown their might by walking hundreds of miles. It’s time for governments and society to reciprocate."
10,Five lessons of Covid: Factors that are negative for India are having greater impact than mitigating ones,"Six months into the Covid pandemic, here are five lessons. The first is that it is lower levels of government, not central governments, that are the mainstays.Don’t look to Trump, Xi, Modi, Merkel, Johnson, Macron, Putin, Bolsonaro, Ramaphosa and Jokowi to wrestle Covid to the ground. In India, the heavy lifting is being done by chief ministers, state officials, municipalities, panchayats, districts, and block development officers. The central government advises, supports, and looks after the macroeconomy – and not much else. Give credit also to the moral economy of ordinary citizens – their local norms of sharing and caring in crises are vital.  A second lesson is stop expecting China and America to lead. China made a terrible mess of its initial response, withheld information, victimised its whistleblowers and continues to obfuscate. While it has recovered, the American response has been calamitous. This is hardly surprising given the inanities of Donald Trump. Leadership has come from small countries and territories – Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand and the Scandinavians (not Sweden). Note that all except Singapore and Thailand are led by women, not alpha males. Amongst bigger countries, Germany, South Korea, and Vietnam stand out.  The third lesson is that science does not know everything, but it knows a lot more than common sense and traditional medicine. In the end, it is science that will help pull us through, with symptomatic treatment, tracking, coordinating and communication technologies, social distancing and proper hygiene practices, and possibly a vaccine. ‘Possibly a vaccine’ because no one has successfully developed a vaccine for a coronavirus.  Fourth, we know what works: testing, social distancing, and hygiene. The most common way of getting Covid seems to be by touch. This is why hygiene, even more than distancing and masks, is vital. These practices buy medical teams time to handle the cases coming their way. That said, Covid will persist. There will be periodic outbreaks and lockdowns, as with Ebola or SARS.  Finally, India confronts a serious situation. Within days, India will have more cases than China. The flattening of the curve is nowhere in sight. The ‘R0’ number which should be less than one is estimated to be 1.4. India’s figures are an underestimate, in any case, as our tracking is weak, partly because testing is so low. The easing of the lockdown will only increase the spread. Easing the lockdown is inescapable, but levels of social distancing and hygiene are simply not good enough. At the current rate, by December, we could have a million cases.  All the factors that were thought to be mitigating for India have failed to protect us: the heat, lack of air conditioning,TB vaccinations and natural immunity. You could argue that Covid’s incidence would have been worse if these factors were not in play, but clearly they are not strong enough to bring the epidemic under control. This is because the factors that are negative for India are having greater impact: weak governance, shambolic healthcare, population density and poverty.  Given what looms, it is fanciful to think that India can take advantage of the opportunity that may exist with China’s downturn and any desire of investors to move out. If those investors go anywhere, it is to Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. In any case, China has gone back to work and has economic and governance strengths India cannot match. The Chinese economy could well come back even stronger, given that all other major economies are floundering. As for India’s ambition to be a “leading power” in this crisis, that is laughable. It needs to get Covid under control, and it must face up to the challenge ahead. It should stop posturing internationally when its own situation is dire. Real leadership is to look a problem in the eye."

Most often, things don’t work out the way we envisaged it. What’s important is to look at why things didn’t work out between the two of you and respect the decision that you have come to. However, if you choose to reconcile with your ex, there still could be some things that might not be the same:Many a time, after a raging fight with your friend or your sibling, you don’t feel like talking to each other.

16,Best Lockdown Fabrics And Styles For Summer Clothes,"Comfort tops the list when we think of summer fashion. And while you might not be able to step out of the house and flaunt the hottest trends of the season, there’s no reason not to dress up while you get through the COVID-19 lockdown! So read this post and find out the best fabrics and styles for summer clothes.  Image: Instagram  Fabrics For Summer Clothes  Wearing the right fabrics in summer will not only keep you feeling comfortable, but will also keep your skin healthy. Here are the best summer fabrics to consider, along with those you would be better off avoiding this season.  Cotton  Cotton comes first to mind for summer clothes for several reasons–it is natural, cheap, easily available, lightweight, breathable, and also soaks up sweat. Cotton keeps the body cool by allowing heat to escape. It does get wrinkled easily and shows sweat patches, but you can consider a cotton-polyester blend to curb these issues. Do remember that with polyester, perspiration absorption goes down so that you might feel some discomfort. Alternatively, choose prints over solids to avoid sweat patches from showing easily.  Bear in mind that cotton spandex or lycra seems to be very comfortable, but they can suffocate your skin. That’s because these fabrics use heavier weight cotton.  Image: Instagram  Linen  Another natural fibre, linen is made from the flax plant and is known for its comfort and cool feel, which make it perfect for summer clothes. Light and loosely woven, linen allows heat to escape from the body, while absorbing sweat readily and drying quickly, keeping you comfortable. Like cotton, linen gets wrinkled easily too, and you can consider linen blends if you wish to.  Khadi  This humble, natural, handspun, organic fabric is ideal for Indian summers. What’s more, khadi is highly durable, so if you’re looking to go the sustainable way, invest in this fabric for summer clothes!  Image: Instagram  Hemp  Hemp is an extremely breathable fabric that is also lightweight, durable, and hardy in that it retains structural quality even after multiple washes. Hemp fabric also contains anti-microbial agents, making it great for those with sensitive skin.  Silk  Natural and lightweight, silk should be one of the ideal fabrics for summer clothes. However, sweat patches are the number one reason to avoid silk in summer. You can consider wearing silk blends or Chanderi, a handloom fabric which is a blend of cotton and silk.  Denim  Our go-to fashion essential isn’t exactly the right choice for summer clothes. Even though all-natural, denim is a heavyweight fabric that isn’t breathable. Skinny jeans, in particular, can be constricting in the heat and can also cause chafing. If you must wear denim, go for comfortable cuts.  Image: Instagram  Chambray  A better alternative to denim is chambray, a plain weave fabric that looks like denim but is much more lightweight. It absorbs sweat readily, is breathable, and comes in darker colours with a natural finish to keep you worry-free in summers.  Tip: Go for all-natural fabrics in summer to keep yourself cool and comfortable all day long. There are several fabrics you can pick from for summer clothes!  Styles For Summer Clothes  Lockdown doesn’t mean you have to rely only on pyjamas all day! There are countless outfit styles for summer clothes you can wear that will not only help you channel your inner fashionista but also keep you comfortable through the day.  Here are some options for summer clothes.  1.Co-Ords  Short for coordinates, co-ords are two-piece separates in matching colours or prints. They’re better than other pieces of clothing for the obvious reason–they can be mixed and matched with everything else in your wardrobe!  Check out these styles by Ananya Panday.  Image: Instagram  Image: Instagram  2. Kurtas  Full-sleeved or sleeveless, ankle or knee-length, plain or printed, there’s no dearth of choices when it comes to the traditional kurta. Chuck the leggings and churidar for summers and pair kurtas with breezy palazzos or straight cut trousers instead.  Take cues from Kangana Ranaut.  Image: Instagram  Image: Instagram  3. Shorts  Shorts and summers go hand in hand! Opt for cotton or linen shorts over denim ones, if you will, and pair with crop tops, blouses, or shirts!  Alaya F. flaunts her eclectic style.  Image: Instagram  Image: Instagram  4. Skirts  Mini skirts might spring to mind, but do give a thought to pleated knee-length skirts or A-line maxi skirts. These flowy cuts and silhouettes will be more comfortable for summer clothes, and you can style them effortlessly with a variety of tops.  Take style tips to skirt from Sonam Kapoor Ahuja.

Go for solids or prints and make the most of the season!  We love these jumpsuits worn by Rakul Preet and Shraddha Kapoor.  Image: Instagram  Image: Instagram  Tip: Pick your favourite styles for summer clothes this season from the many options available!  FAQs: Best Lockdown Fabrics And Styles For Summer Clothes  Q. How to remove sweat stains from summer clothes?  A. Sweat stains can be hard to remove. So if you’ve put your favourite clothes at the back of your wardrobe because of the unsightly patches, read these tips:  - Mix two tablespoons of salt in half a litre of hot water. Dab this onto the sweat stains using a soft cloth or sponge until the stains lighten. Rinse and dry as usual.  - Mix freshly squeezed lemon juice with equal parts water. Gently scrub stains using this mixture and see the results for yourself!  - Take dishwashing liquid and hydrogen peroxide in the ratio of 1:2. Scrub the stain gently using this mixture. Let sit for an hour before rinsing.  - Before laundering clothes, dab on a bit of vinegar on the sweat stains. This trick can also be applied to deodorant stains. You can also use ammonia in place of vinegar but refrain from mixing it with bleach.  - Make a paste of baking soda and warm water. Rub the stains gently with this mixture and rinse the garment. For stubborn stains, let the baking soda sit on the stain for about an hour or two.  Image: Instagram  Q. How to prevent chafing in summer?  A. Chafing is a common skin problem in summer that is a result of sweat, friction, and irritating fabric. Opting for the right materials for summer clothes can reduce chafing considerably. Note these points as well:  - Use anti-chafing gels or creams–these are your best bet, especially when the problem gets out of hand in the form of blisters or broken skin.  - For a gentle and effective solution, apply baby powder or regular talcum powder to the skin. You can also use dusting powders which use ingredients like clay, cocoa butter, plant extracts, etc.  - Apply dry shampoo over the areas where the skin is going to rub against itself. Dry shampoo is effective in absorbing moisture so it can help prevent chafing.  - Use a deodorant stick on areas prone to chafing. This will not only keep sweat at bay but also provide lubrication, preventing friction.  - Petroleum jelly can also work in the same way as deodorant sticks.  - When wearing skirts, wear shorts made of moisture-wicking fabric underneath to keep your thighs from chafing.  - Use home remedies to treat chafing. Aloe vera gel can heal and treat inflammation, as can coconut oil. Instead of talcum powder and petroleum jelly, you can use cornstarch and shea butter to prevent chafing."
17,Why Wait?,"Do joyful people find meditation easier to practise than sad, morose people? Is the Self-realisation goal easier to attain for happy people? — Raj, 39, Chennai    When we are happy and full of joyous excitement, our prana, life energy, moves upwards. This upward movement helps us in our spiritual practice. We get better results in our sadhana. If the happiness quotient of a sadhaka continues to increase, then dhyana is deeper and quicker. It is important for a spiritual practitioner to be motivated. The yoga shastras say that a practitioner’s enthusiasm is a significant aspect of his sadhana; it’s his first step towards spiritual progress. If you are not excited about your spiritual practice, then it is difficult to make progress on the path. If you are sad and unhappy, then your prana will soon start waning. Consequently, you will not be able to concentrate. This will allow all sorts of disorders to take root in your mind. That’s why unhappy people are not able to be successful in their spiritual endeavours.    Happiness is the prerequisite for any kind of sadhana, which is why gurus lay emphasis on satsang.    Through satsang, an individual’s mental conflicts are resolved and he becomes peaceful. Once he is in a calmer frame of mind, he can begin his sadhana. Just like stale, musty fruits and flowers are not used as offerings in religious rituals like puja, similarly, a drooping, unhealthy body cannot help you move forward in your sadhana. That’s why it is important to start spiritual practices when you are younger and more energetic and it is even better if children are introduced to spiritual practices. So, start today for stellar results. ■Send your questions to st.editorial@timesgroup.com with subject line: Ask Surakshit and state your age"
18,Reformat Your Memory,"  ANIL K RAJVANSHI tells us how to stop unpleasant thoughts and memories from affecting us adversely    From my younger days, I have had the ability to sense when somebody is thinking about me. This ability allows me to react even before the person has spoken or made his intentions known — most of the time with disastrous results.    Most people, now and then, do exhibit this ability of reading the mind and I feel everybody has this capability though they may not be aware of it.    Brain Power    The brain is not only an instrument that can create thought but it can also send this signal and receive external thoughts. We do have painful memories associated with people, places and objects. Quite often, negative thoughts from them bother us.    How is the external thought received and is it possible to stop it from affecting us? Taking the analogy of modern computers or phone apps may provide a possible answer. An app in the phone or laptop gets its update, notification and data only when the app is on the instrument. If the app is removed from the device, then, no data can be received, though that information is in the ‘environment’.    Similarly, if the painful memory of a person or event is removed from the brain, then, no thought about it can be processed by it.How do you selectively remove painful memories? Recently, scientists have discovered that if we think about a certain person, object, or event, then that memory becomes pliable, that is, it can be modified with a new memory. Neural pathways, when active, are amenable to modifications. If at this time, happy memories are remembered actively, then they might weaken and replace negative thoughts.In a hypnosis session, it is commonly seen that the hypnotist suggests new ideas and thoughts to the patient and these get implanted in the brain.This is useful, especially when a patient is talking about a painful past episode. This way, unpleasant memories can be modified with new, suggested memories. But this is a dangerous process since the other person can play with the patient’s memory, and there have been cases of false memory implanted in quite a number of hypnotised patients with harmful results. Implanting of new memory by oneself is difficult.So, a better way to do so is to practise yoga and meditation. When one is immersed in deep thought on a subject for a long time, then the majority of neural pathways in the brain are used mostly to focus on that thought. This allows other memories to weaken and provides possible opportunity for removal of unpleasant memories.Sanyam, deep thought, according to Patanjali Yoga, can be cultivated with long practice and is the surest way to make the brain supple. Then, unpleasant memories can be reduced and rendered irrelevant.In such circumstances, when external thought impinges on the brain, then it will not be registered, since the memory of that thought (app) is missing or has become corrupted.Often, when a virus affects the computer, the best way to remove it is by formatting the hard disk. Weakening of memories by sanyam provide mechanisms in the brain to do just that, and this is far better than tinkering with selective removal of memory.The loosening of memory also helps one in becoming detached. It is memory that gives rise to attachment either to people or property; when memory becomes weak, detachment results. That is the basic tenet of Patanjali Yoga Darshan. ■The author, a scientist, is director, Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute, Phaltan, Maharashtra"
19,Her Loyal Messenger,"Here, in one more of her short, fictionalised mythological stories, SAISWAROOPA IYER writes of Agnidyotana’s close encounter with divinity in his quest to fulfil a promise he made to Rukmini    The wilderness was daunting. Agnidyotana clutched his staff. His other hand instinctively held what constituted his mission, a letter from Princess Rukmini to the Yadava lord, Krishna Vasudeva. Agnidyotana had been walking for four days now. When his feet could carry him no further, he sank to the ground. Of all the people at Kundinapura, Princess Rukmini had to choose him, an ageing brahmin, for this critical task. He had stuck to a less taken path to avoid being recognised by spies. But the decision had cost him his speed and safety, too. The wilderness around him did not allow him a good night’s sleep. And he was hungry. Could he reach Dwaraka before the stipulated date? O, why didn’t he choose the path close to the shore, friendlier to travellers?    “Shambho Mahadeva! Help me! Help Rukmini assert her consent, Lord!” He tried to trudge ahead. Agnidyotana was stuck in a hostile wild patch where even a stray boar could make a meal of him.    What happened to the merit of his life — of rituals and sadhana? Could the gods not rescue him, especially when someone’s future hung in the balance?Dizzy, Agnidyotana caught hold of the nearest creeper for support. He felt the creeper was too soft — it was a part of a net! A hunter’s net. Just then, he felt the net descend upon him. It meant that he was in an inhabited part of this land. Perhaps the hunter couldhelp him?Soon, he heard footsteps and a flame torch lit up the surroundings and Agnidyotana saw the hunter. “Well, well! If the gods don’t mean to make a cannibal out of me! Why would a human be stuck in my net?”“I need your help, brother!” Agnidyotana did not waste a moment as the hunter helped him out of the net.“Help me reach Saurashtra. At the earliest!”“Gather your breath, Brahmana!” The hunter chuckled.“And who in his right mind would venture into this wilderness? If not the wild animals, hunger would see the last of you! Forget reaching Saurashtra or wherever.”Agnidyotana heard an anklet jingle. A woman? In these surroundings! He saw the bearded hunter grin. She emerged out of what seemed like a narrow path through thickets. It hadto be the hunter’s wife, frowning at what her husband had just said.“Running my reputation along with yours to the ground, aren’t you? What are you, a hunter, there for, if not to kill wild animals?” She chided the hunter and then turned to Agnidyotana. “And the forest has enough to not let anyone go hungry.” She beamed and led the way. “This man here does not see anything beyond graves and pyres. And I belong to a hospitable hill tribe who never lets a guest go hungry!” There was something rhythmic about her lilt and the tinkle of her anklets that Agnidyotana felt was surreal.Before long, they reached an inconspicuous cave that was the hunter’s home and the woman lit a fire to cook a meal. “What brings you to these forests, Brahmana?”Agnidyotana could not keep a secret from the kind couple who were feeding him in the middle of nowhere. Still, he took care to leave out specifics. “A noble maiden has chosen her future Lord. Alas, her elder brother thinks he has the power to seal her future, despite her resistance. I bearher message to her chosen man.”Agnidyotana saw the couple exchange an amused glance. “When this woman chose me, the whole world tried dissuading her. Including me!”“Ignore him. He only meant to test!” The woman interjected with a mock frown turning into a smile when her eyes met her husband’s.“But tell me good sire, your mission seems to concern the affairs of powerful people. Is it safe for you to get in?”“It is the matter of Dharma, kind lady.” Agnidyotana smiled at the aroma of freshly cooked gruel. “All my life, I have been a man of scripture and they proscribe violation of a woman’s consent. The gods I worship get angry at the kingdom that insults women. I am a purohita and it is my duty to take corrective course of action to save my city from the wrath of gods. May they help me in my mission!”The simple gruel was tastier than anything that Agnidyotana had ever eaten before. Energising, too. Like he had eaten enough food for a whole week. “Arise and walk ahead, Brahmana.” The hunter spoke, in a tone surprisingly solemn. “You cannot afford to tarry.”Agnidyotana rose, as if in a trance and picked up his staff. Grunts of wild boars ceased to be a concern, like the thorny path ahead of him. His mind replayed the picture of an anxious Rukmini depending upon his success and he strode ahead all night. In the wee hours, he heard a sound that made his eyes moist with gratitude. The sound of sea waves. He had reached Saurashtra. Dwaraka is nigh!Seated on the snowy top of Mount Kailasa, the god of gods raised a brow, though a knowing smile played on his lips as he turned to the mother of the universe. “The distance he covered within a night, Parvati! What did you feed him?” ■"
20,"Try self-kindness, therapy to beat Covid blues","To help readers cope with their lockdown anxieties, The Times of India has launched Talk it Out, a new series under which our panel of expert counsellors will answer your mental health queries. This week’s advice comes from counselling psychologist Paras Sharma    My wife is suffering from anxiety. She becomes violent, starts hitting me, and feels my parents are conspiring against her. She becomes normal later but gets triggered by almost anything. Is there a way to keep her calm?    — Anonymous    Dear Anonymous, anxiety is one of the most common feelings people are experiencing right now because of the added strain of family members being there all the time, supplies drying up, and it being an uncertain time. It is natural for people to be anxious. First, investigate what the relationship between your wife and parents was like prior to the lockdown. It’s possible that it hasn’t been a pleasant one, and the severity of it is becoming visible to you now because you are at home more, so don’t dismiss it as just her anxiety or paranoia. Secondly, don’t offer solutions to your wife but hear her out.    Ask her what you can do to help with the chores and generally be a little more patient. Lastly, suggest the idea of counselling for her individually and for both of you together.— Utkarsh KapoorHi Utkarsh, I understand this is a difficult time. People haven’t been able to find jobs or had job offers rescinded and this can be demotivating. I’d advise you to focus on your mental health and think of this as a temporary phase which will eventually lift. For now, consider therapy and talk to a friend or a loved one and ensure that your sleep and appetite are regular. You can also practise some mindfulness meditation before you study. Do not have unrealistic expectations from yourself. Even if you are able to concentrate for 30-40 minutes at a time, remind yourself that it’s a difficult time and it’s okay to take breaks while studying.— NainaNaina, I can understand this is a bad situation to be in. It’s important not to blame yourself. I think you can benefit from practising self-kindness because a lot of self-worth comes from our job and relationships, and when we don’t have these, it’s easy to feel worthless. My second advice would be safety and stability. Have you been taking medication and therapy? Check with your psychiatrist if the dosage needs to be temporarily altered. It may be useful to increase your therapy to once a week to process these difficult emotions and have a friend as an SOS contact. There are group therapy options online, where you can talk to people going through similar issues. Finally, you can do some activities like online fitness classes and home workouts.— Anil HotaHi Anil, your problem is as much financial as it is mental. The best thing to do is to have an honest conversation with your family. Sometimes you could be pressured to put on a brave face and make it sound like you have everything under control. But it can be quite difficult to face all of this alone, so confide in your family and discuss what this means in terms of lifestyle changes and temporary restrictions. Secondly, you can speak to vendors and debtors and ask for some time to repay them. You can also apply for an EMI holiday that has been announced. Similarly, GST and IT filing dates have been extended. As far as possible, take these benefits to ease up the pressure.Sharma is director, The Alternative Story.For more questions and answers, visit toi.in."
21,"Practise Eco-philosophy, Celebrate Life","  The value of life has perhaps not been understood as well as it has been in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Indicators of materialistic progress, like GDP and GNP, have receded before life’s love for life. Governments have put their country’s economic plans and programmes on hold, giving precedence to saving lives.    Life loves life, a notion emanating from the eco-philosophy of Henryk Skolimowski, is a universal law . Since life loves to love life, life loves to wish to see life everywhere. -- not just human life, but life in its in the biosphere. Life wishes to see life even beyond Earth, a dream that one day may come true. Other planets in the cosmos where possibilities of life to evolve exist have always engaged our attention. Life wills life to prevail as intensively as possible!    Monocultures are not life-enabling. It tends to evolve and blossom in diversity, in heterogeneity. Not a single species is independent in itself. Every species and every individual of every species is dependent on numerous other species. The higher the level of biodiversity, greater the degree of resilience and sustainability.    When we talk about life, we look deeply into our dependence on all life forms prevailing on Earth.Exploration of other planets with even smallest fraction of similarity with Earth excites entire humanity because, life loves to love life. Our excitement and curiosity know no bounds when even a rudimentary hint of life comes to the fore. We feel thrilled when we look at footprints of what seems like rivers on the surface of the Red Planet; that perhaps there was once life on Mars! Maybe even now there are some microbes present, we don’t know.When we observed the Venus Transit, rare cosmic events that occurred in 2004 and 2012, we celebrated the event with joy. When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon and human footprints were left on the lunar surface in 1969, we felt on top of the world.Here is a poem, titled ‘Life Loves Life,’ written by Juanita Skolimowski, as tribute to her husband, Henryk Skolimowski, who passionately embraced and promoted sustainable living, conservation of life, and light as life-sustaining energy:    The underlying truth    is that Life loves life.    Each living being    Emerges from    the ground of being—    connected and sustained.    The web of Life.    an intricate living mandala:    Radiant and subtle    Magical and mysterious    Fragile and enduring.    The dance of life in all.      Life’s love for life runs through our nerves. We jump with joy when told by scientists that one of the Saturn’s moon’s atmosphere is similar to the Earth’s. So too when the Chandrayan mission discovers the possible presence of water, a symbol of life, on the Moon. The very thought that we may not be alone in the universe fills us with hope. This curiosity, zeal, excitement, thrill, this happiness and joy are all there because of the universal law: Life loves to love life. Life desperately expands its scope, horizon, sphere, light and glory. Life, therefore, cannot be complacent with its existence confined to Earth. It strives for extending its wings to other dimensions. May 4 is celebrated as Eco-philosophy Day.

22,Indian Intellect Vs Bharatiya Viveka Buddhi -1,"1. Intellect is a faculty of mind: Mind is extremely difficult to control. Intellect has to be developed and empowered to manage the uncontrolled and unguided mind. We have the freedom to develop the Intellect for our purposes; good or bad! Viveka buddhi is that intellect which guides us towards the higher, better, highest ‘good’!  Modern societies, aping the western cultures, have kept education focused on developing the IQ aspect of intellect, but have ignored its character-building aspect. We’re happy keeping our minds externally focused, chasing after the infinite variety of science, technology, comforts, glitter of the materialistic world.  2. Vivek-buddhi: Viveka is that power of intellect, which helps us discriminate and enables us choose and follow the virtuous path of ethics, values, dharma, swadharma, in and thru’ our daily working and living. It is the virtuous path that leads to both external material success and internal peace, happiness, fulfilment; not just for ‘us’ but for ‘all’. Bereft of inner spiritual awareness, schooling has failed miserably to awaken and strengthen this faculty of discriminative and determinative intellect. The result is growing materialism, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, greed, selfishness, corruption, etc. Whole society, including Religions, have become self-centered, concerned with ‘Me-Mine’, ‘My-God vs Your-God’.  3. Ancient wisdom mocks at modern India: It asks: With all your sciences and intelligence have you tried to go inwards to discover what this mind and intellect are all about? Have you as society discussed and agreed upon what ‘good’ is? What is the very purpose of our daily working, living, dying? Is it only to help live in this external world controlling and lording over nature and other living beings? Have you as a society explored and analyzed the worldview and vedantic wisdom of our forefathers because of which we survive till today, in spite of all attacks and criticisms? Have you with all your modern socio-religious theories and sciences created a better society where enlightened citizen are guiding us and inspiring us to strive to fulfill our swadharma?  Ancient societies have grappled with these basic issues of, ‘know thyself’; ‘Kingdom of God within’ and created systems where commitment to swadharma, to character, was supreme and the very purpose of education. They have given us the conviction that fulfilling our swadharma can alone guarantee peace, happiness, prosperity. They warn us, beware of systems which allow people without character to positions of public good; beware of building mere IQ-intellect without character!  It asks the greatest intellectuals of today; have you bothered to go deep within yourself to know what intellect and life are all about? It is comparatively easy they say, for the intellect to learn about external nature. It is far more difficult to direct and make the mind and intellect go inwards, to learn about itself. Once we strive and struggle to develop viveka buddhi, go inwards to know our self; our life gradually changes for the better. We become spiritual; we’re no longer a curse to others, we become a blessing for everyone.  Modern society is full of examples of preachers, public servants, rising to positions of power and status beyond their character and competence, ignoring the principle that punishment for transgressions done by people responsible for teaching and managing societies, is going to be much more severe.  4. Whither Religions? The purpose of Prophets of Religions was not to divide people into warring, tribal, selfish attitude of my religion and god vs your religion and god, as their self-centered immature followers have now done! Religions were, and are meant to inspire us to go inwards, purify our mind and intellect, so that the purified-intellect, Viveka buddhi, can be directed inwards; to reflect, analyze, discover the reality of our blissful Spiritual Self and strive to regain our lost connection with it, by being committed to our duties, etc. All Prophets wanted to inspire all people to struggle to be good; to do their duties.  5. Whither Academia? Religions have to unite, rise above petty politics and politicians and work together with academia to awaken and strengthen our Viveka-buddhi. Our sages have very clearly spelt out what this wonderful instrument of mind and intellect is and how to awaken, develop it so that it can learn to choose rightly and gradually rise to the ultimate reality that identified with our spiritual reality the whole world is our family.  Schooling is the opportunity to get established in our swadharma – values, disciplines, habits, vocation, in keeping with our tendencies. Intellect is dangerous, until it is tempered with the ability to discriminate and make right choices and the will power to act on them. This was the idea of our varna dharma. Thus, teachers and public servants were supposed to be men of highest character for they were responsible for guiding society towards the higher dimensions of work and life. They were to spread knowledge and in return, society had the responsibility of taking care of their simple, minimal needs. Ravana is an example of intellectual arrogance not tempered by wisdom.  6. Conclusion: Our parents and teachers now have to ensure that we learn to struggle to overcome our past negative habits during schooling so that the intellect is transformed into Viveka buddhi and used harmoniously both for external material success and internal spiritual success."
23,Corona-induced cuts shouldn’t mar army capabilities,"Most of these proposals have come to our knowledge through media reports, and while we may not know the fine print, the overall thrust is clear. There is an attempt to find ways to alleviate some pressure on the already stressed defence budget that could see a further coronainduced reduction. The idea is laudatory, but we must also not lose sight of the longterm impact of decisions taken today on the overall effectiveness of the military.  Looking first at the proposals concerning the ‘men’ or our human capital of men and women in the military. Two schemes under consideration are the increase of retirement age and the introduction of a three-year ‘Tour of Duty’ in the Indian Army.  The Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, recently announced, “We are soon bringing a policy to extend the service profile of the men and have an increased minimum retirement age” as the defence pension bill was becoming “unsustainable”. With this proposal, almost one-third of the military personnel would retire at the age of 58.  This is a practical move given the much better physical and medical standards that our soldiers enjoy today. Extension of service would prevent a premature haemorrhaging of trained and experienced workforce, particularly in technical services. There will also be a positive effect on the pension bill.  The Army’s proposal on the ‘Tour of Duty’ needs a more serious deliberation. The Army’s internal note has cited a “resurgence of nationalism and patriotism” and the “rising unemployment” to propose a three-year “internship” for those who “do not want to make defence services their permanent vocation, but still want to experience the thrill and adventure of military professionalism”. With this scheme, the Indian Army seeks to save on the training, pay, and gratuity costs of a regular officer or soldier.  In my view, this proposal raises some fundamental questions about the very character of the profession of arms. The military service is a vocation, a higher calling, and a way of life where selfsacrifice is the highest duty. It should not be considered a place for adventure and thrill seekers or a steppingstone for lucrative corporate careers. I have no doubts about the motivation of the young men who will join this “internship” but putting inadequately trained officers and men in combat situations is unfair to both them and their comrades.  Every nation has its unique military challenges, and comparison with other countries that follow a two to three-year conscription model would be inappropriate. In case we require some young talent in specialised areas for a temporary period, we could suitably modify our existing provisions for Short Service Commission and Territorial Army.  The reference to patriotism and nationalism in the Army note was utterly unnecessary. Walter Berns, in his book Making Patriots, defines patriotism as the devotion not only to the country but also to its principles, and equally importantly, an understanding of these principles. Donning the uniform is not the only criteria for displaying your patriotism. It is also a reality, as many studies have shown, that the primary motivation for soldiers in combat is not some higher national ideal but the cohesion of your small unit and the trust in your comrades.  Turning now to the ‘machines’. In giving a push for ‘Make in India’, General Rawat asked the military to stop “misrepresenting our operational requirements” and accept indigenous weapons even if they met “70 percent of the specifications the military ideally required”. There is no doubt that India is one of the biggest arms importers in the world, and this fact is a severe matter of concern. self-reliance in the defence sector is an absolute imperative if India is to become a truly global military power.  However, this will require substantial structural reforms. There is a need for policy changes to encourage the private sector by financial support and preferential treatment over foreign vendors. No company will spend crores in developing weapon platforms if there is no guarantee for purchase by the government. There should be a complete revamping of the Defence Public Sector Undertakings and an overhaul of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, which have shown little innovation in high technology areas.  Asking the military to accept weapons that do not fully meet the operational requirement, only because they are produced in India, is dangerous. In a life and death situation, a soldier’s best friend is his equipment. I have heard many frustrated soldiers express their anguish when their grenades would not explode, or the rifle jammed during an encounter with terrorists.  The problem of inadequate quality is even more critical in equipment-intensive services like the Navy and Air Force. When a pilot is flying a single-seater fighter aircraft, he is highly dependent on the performance of his machine. Lord Moran, in his classic work, ‘The Anatomy of Courage’, writes, “When I ask a station commander what strengthens the resolve of his pilots he answers ‘always leadership’ and then after a pause often adds ‘and the quality of their equipment’.”  The senior military leadership undoubtedly needs to deal with the challenges posed by the size and shape of the defence budget. However, in finding solutions, it must be ensured that the efficiency of the force remains unimpaired."
24,Why prohibition makes little sense in Covid times,"One of the unprepared-for aspects of the continuing lockdown was the 40-day prohibition of over-the-counter sale of alcohol. To complain about its unavailability while people are fighting for lives and livelihoods would be, at best, churlish, and at worst, elitist — such elitism presuming that only a certain socio-economic section of the drinking classes were clamouring for it, a presumption since disproved hopefully by the images of lined-up ‘liquor louts’. So, in a country that goes impractically ‘dry’ — one just hoards up on every ‘dry day eve’ — tipplers bore national temperance (wo)manfully.  True, alcoholic drinks were never going to find themselves on any ‘essential goods’ list. But as the lockdown continued to grind away, the pinch was being also felt by state governments denied their income. Through excise duty revenues, about Rs 2.48 trillion is earned annually across the republic. Turning off this tap, at a time when easy money is tough to find, was self-righteous and self-lacerating.  Displays of social distancing going to the dogs outside thekas since Monday may well roil many a single-malter or cofficionado. But these demand throngs were born out of supply shutdowns — something that should have been soberly factored in when invoking temporary prohibition.  But drinkers have always been an easy target for the mai-baap State. Not content with gathering ‘sin tax’ — where you pay for the sin of drinking, and that money will be well used to ‘better society’ — the State uses both the valid reasoning of additional health expenditure and the less valid excuse of moral turpitude to see alcohol consumption less as a social activity, and more as an evil to be dealt with pragmatically.  This frowning upon drinking is enjoined in the Constitution itself. Article 47 states that ‘the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks’. Interestingly, the perception of drinking being a bad foreign influence, and that the State will strive to get rid of it one sunny day, is somewhat mirrored in Article 343. After failing to phase out the English language over a 15-year period as an official Indian language when the Constitution was adopted in 1950, it now ‘tolerates’ its continued use as official language.  The invisible connection between the English (not language, but rule) and drinking alcohol, made by the likes of Tilak and Gokhale, was echoed as recently as in 2016 by chief minister Nitish Kumar while imposing a total prohibition in Bihar. ‘I want to make it clear to these English-speaking people that consuming liquor is not a part of fundamental rights,’ he said, dedicating the prohibition decision to the ‘Rashtrapita’.  Which is where we can source our mai-baap State’s maternal-paternal discomfort with its uneasy sanctioning of Indian adults drinking: the father of the nation. In their 2005 insightful essay, ‘Poverty and Purification: The Politics of Gandhi’s Campaign for Prohibition,’ historians David M Fahey and Padma Manian explore Mohandas Gandhi’s profound antipathy towards drinkers. ‘… he even went so far as to argue that… “in the wake of drinking follow insanity, adultery, gambling, etc. It depraves the mind and hardens the heart with cruelty.”’  While any prohibitionist’s argument can be used to highlight the correlation between drinking and domestic violence, the correlation is made to grow into a cause. Brawls, wife-beating and child abuse are, indeed, caused by drunken men, but hardly by drunken men alone. Instead of coming down hard on such crimes, the correlated cause — in this case, drinking — becomes the target. The fact that wife-beating can be conducted by a sober man, or indeed female members of a family, are not made to muddy this ‘equation’.  But Gandhi’s success in stigmatising a drinking habit as foreign to India stands on less firm legs. As Fahey and Manian point out, ‘most Indian drinkers were [and remain] poor, illiterate, and lacking in political influence,’ thereby making prohibition ‘a policy with few political disadvantages… except for the Parsis and some Sikhs and Kshatriyas, however, Indian elites, influenced by religion and custom, rarely drank alcohol’.  Fahey and Manian refer to a 1951 Bombay University study that looked at the drinking practices in eight South Gujarat villages. At least one family member drank in 80% of lower caste, Dalit and tribal families; 59% in Muslim families; 7.5% in upper caste families. So, in historian David Hartiman’s words, people like Gandhi ‘confused their own elite values with Indian culture as a whole’.  A call for prohibition threatened to deny significant revenue to the British India administration by way of alcohol sales. This made ample political sense for freedom fighters. But in 2020, swaraj being attained for a while now, GoI abstaining from much-needed revenue bears more than a strong whiff of a colonial hangover. Something I hope to wake up with, minus the colonial bit, tomorrow, for god and country."
