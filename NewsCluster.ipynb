century there has been a disease that has claimed thousands of lives the 17th century great plague of london taught one section of the society the importance of isolation and they have been doing that since then    during the time of that plague a village by the name of eyam isolated itself  they did not let people cross its boundaries  tamworth herald  the village  between 166566 england suffered the devastation of the terrible plague ever since coronavirus started wreaking havoc in the world that period of plague has been used as comparison by many one story about that plague involves the eyam village  in eyam at one time there was human habitation there were festivals and fairs but then suddenly the village was deserted to be never settled in again the story of eyams desolation dates back 350 years the village is in the derbyshire dales district about three hours from london  the national  there are still less than one thousand people living in the outer parts of this village but the main part has been completely deserted since the plague the plague wreaked havoc in 1665–66 in various parts of england especially in london and the areas around it for nearly 14 months according to government records 75000 people lost their lives due to it  however many historians claim that more than 1 lakh people had died well the story is not of plague figures but of courage because this village prevented the spread of infection if the people of eyam village had not quarantined the entire village in time then there would have been many more deaths  when the plague was spreading in london eyam village was safe for some time the reason was that people used to go out of their village very rarely but alexander headfield a tailor of a village unaware of the danger reached london from where he bought a cloth station he did not know that the place he bought it from was infected with flea spreading the plague  plague reaches the village  he then reached the village and work continued in his shop but within a week the assistant george vickers who opened the bundle died all the people whom he had met for a week had become infected and slowly a chain was formed the infection spread throughout the village  tamwarth herald  from september to december 1665 about 42 villagers died in early 1666 people planned to move out of the village so that the survivors were safe however the village rector william mompesson and the expelled former rector thomas stanley explained to the villagers that it was more dangerous to do so because there is an epidemic even outside the village  the selfimposed isolation  now the only way was imprison themselves that too in a way that the disease did not spread to the surrounding villages where the infection had not yet reached after much persuasion most of the villagers agreed to this decision and those who were not ready moved out of the village  none of them ever returned on 24 june 1666 all the roads in the village were closed to outsiders at the behest of william mompesson a stone wall was built around the village which is still known as mompessons wall  a small hole was placed in this wall from where the villagers used to throw out some coins and other people who wanted to help used to deliver food and other things due to this the epidemic did not go out of the village women and children of the house lived in tunnels built beneath the houses so that they could be kept alive  picfair  the bodies of those who died of plague were buried in the forests far away from the village in the process of cremation the gathering of the villagers was banned nobody got out of houses churches were closed meetings were held in the open ground in which only the necessary people were involved  death continued in the village even after such tough rules the most severe form of infection appeared in august 1666 when five to six deaths occurred within a day in the village there was no house where there was no dead body there is mention of a woman in history whose name was elizabeth hancock who within eight days saw her husband and six young innocent children die  daily elizabeth would drag a corpse from her house dig a grave and bury the body gradually the number of infected people became so high that most of the families of the village were destroyed  flattening the curve  mompesen has written in his diary that the era was terrible but the villagers had so much faith in their god that they did not panic they did not run they stayed so that the rest of the world would be safe after thousands of deaths cases of infection started decreasing in septemberoctober and then on november 1 the disease suddenly disappeared   letsgopeakdistrict  but eyam lost more than half of its families during this period according to government document 260 people from 76 families of the village died within a year at that time population of the village was less than 800 even after the outbreak of the pandemic the people of eyam village had become adept at keeping themselves quarantined or rather they were scared  after many years people started pulling themselves out and then gradually the main village became empty today eyam has become a tourist destination the isolation we have to observe today is way better and privileged than what eyam had to do 350 years ago  do not consider yourself a prisoner

vanload of kit on the far side of the world  for radka and ivar the plan began to form when they met in 2016 both working as personal carers for a disabled man in trondheim central norway they would cross paths as she finished the night shift and he took over for the day  we met for like five minutes to change the shift i was very charming in the morning jokes radka  and then you would stay for breakfast sometimes ivar adds  radka was the more experienced traveller she had previously hitchhiked from russia to southeast asia and was preparing to do the same from argentina to alaska but after falling in love with ivar who was in the process of retraining as a nurse she faced a dilemma  there were lots of conversations i said you have to promise me that once youre done studying youll go with me it was a dealbreaker and ivar adopted my dream very quickly she says  in the meantime radka took a sixweek trip to patagonia with a friend and at one point hitched a lift with a woman called silvia from ushuaia in argentina the worlds southernmost city they stayed in touch and three years later this would turn out to be a critical stroke of luck  radka and ivars plan slowly morphed from backpacking to travelling the americas by van and they picked up a secondhand toyota hiace with help from radkas dad they built a basic bed and kitchen in the back and storage for their gear  including climbing and freediving equipment bicycles and an inflatable canoe  we needed a van because ivar has a shedload of sports stuff says radka but also its the freedom of it when we are inside the van with gas for two months and food for several weeks we can be totally off grid we thought it would be great to have comfort and the ability to drive wherever we want  image copyright radka and ivar  ivar whod previously been a climbing instructor studied hard for his nursing degree and they worked every single job that came our way to save money says radka who would often finish a nightshift and go on to do cleaning jobs before having four hours off ahead of the next nightshift  she developed terrible sleeping problems she says i burnt out and made myself ill but i did it because i had a dream and i wanted to make it come true  in the flurry of preparations they were still making lastminute modifications to the van on the day they drove it to the port in germany for its voyage across the atlantic and through the panama canal to chile  six weeks later in early january they were in san antonio to collect it and begin their epic journey it was the height of summer and their plan was to loop down at a leisurely pace to the southern tip of argentina  the symbolic start of their onetotwo year trip  and then drive north all the way to alaska  so stopping frequently they slowly headed south enjoying hikes in the chilean island of chiloé and argentinian trekking hub of el chaltén and a trip to the 5kmwide perito moreno glacier camping out in nature soon started to smooth out radkas erratic sleeping patterns  el chaltén was absolutely amazing says radka who had long fantasised about photographing the famous fiery reds and burnt oranges and yellows of the patagonian autumn which by this time was already beginning  but the weather forecast was bad so we said lets go to ushuaia and when we come back this way its going to be even nicer colours ivar says  by this stage they were hearing reports of covid lockdowns in europe but were reassured by friends in argentina and chile that similar moves seemed unlikely there  we were discussing whether we should go to ushuaia or not because its locked in with a chilean part above it but there really wasnt any news and when we asked people they said it was just recommended to wash your hands no more so we decided to go and then it all happened really quickly and we couldnt get back out says ivar  image copyright radka and ivar  hours after they arrived on 15 march the borders unexpectedly closed trapping them on the argentinian side of tierra del fuego island which can only be exited via a chilean ferry  with people being ordered to stay at home or in hotels they decided to drive out of the city and wait out the initial 14day lockdown in their van as camping was banned they had to conceal their plans from the police when they encountered a checkpoint at the edge of ushuaia an hour north at a forest lake called laguna margarita they found a spot to wildcamp  we were afraid someone would see us and report us but we were really deep in the woods and nobody came says ivar  when the weather allowed they paddled on the lake or went running ivar taught radka how to ropeclimb in the trees it was tough going at times too the wind and rain often forced them inside and there wasnt enough sun to replenish their solargenerated electricity on day two they ran out of cooking gas and they were washing in nearfreezing water  but they werent too worried once the twoweek confinement was over they would return to el chaltén and wait out the crisis  they could happily spend months hiking in the national parks mountains the lack of gas however forced them to drive back towards ushuaia and when they picked up a phone signal again it became obvious the crisis was deepening national parks had closed they read increasingly desperate reports from fellow nomads on facebook forums  moreover they were really afraid they would get into trouble from the police for camping in the car during lockdown we didnt know how to explain where wed been for those two weeks or where we were going says radka she messaged silvia the woman who had given her a ride in 2016 could she vouch for them or provide an address  en route back to ushuaia they hit a police checkpoint  they were filming us and the car asking where we had been where we were going we tried to tell them wed been camping but we dont speak good spanish im not sure they understood says ivar  we were so stressed we then took off in the wrong direction when we turned back we were met by two police cars with sirens  the officers werent pleased  they said they would escort us to our hostel in ushuaia they didnt realise we didnt have one  on the way radka tried silvia again and luckily she responded within the halfhour drive she had secured them a friends rental apartment and they were escorted right to the door by the police  image copyright radka and ivar  two weeks of lockdown in the apartment followed it was much like those seen elsewhere with trips to the supermarket or pharmacy allowed and little else  for the first few days we felt ok bingewatching tv series enjoying hot showers but we started to realise this was not going to be a situation for a couple of weeks and that we really couldnt afford to pay for accommodation for up to six months because even if they then opened the borders wed be out of money we were quickly getting more and more tired and depressed and i started having problems sleeping again says radka tearfully  when you are at home i imagine you find things to keep yourself busy  clean or paint or bake whatever but being in a foreign flat in a foreign country where you were not planning to stay its maybe different says radka you cant focus on doing something new you spend your day researching every desperate possibility to get out of there we were even looking at whether it was possible to sail across the ocean and when each one is a dead end it feels like such a waste of energy and motivation  ivar adds its like waiting in a bus stop when you dont know exactly when youre going to leave and its not the place you want to be  but the decision to leave wasnt straightforward it slowly crept up on them says ivar it kind of evolved from possibly going home because its going to be boring to wait to realising if we stay three of four more months our wellbeing might suffer  when radka received an sms from the embassy to say there were repatriation flights from the capital buenos aires she felt an irresistible pull homewards  i felt a bit like a failure when i started to consider going back we have friends who are staying it was like we were giving up but everybodys situation is different  radka and ivar are part of a sizeable community of people who travel and live in vehicles for months or years at a time  sometimes permanently  and are known as overlanders or vanlifers some work as they go along or stop for a while to volunteer others have already retired ask them to stayathome and well it can be a bit complicated where  you might think that as they are equipped to live offgrid they would be fine during lockdown in reality their lifestyle choice depends on the ability to move around camp and access services like water power gas and toilets with regional and national borders closed most campsites shut and wild camping banned outsiders being discouraged in many areas and bureaucratic headaches over visas and complicated vehicle permits thousands of travellers around the world are either trapped or having to abandon their homes on wheels and return home  in some ways covid19 has been like a game of musical chairs for overlanders who have found themselves in varying situations depending on where they happened to be when the music stopped  around 10000km north of ushuaia in the colombian city of medellín berliners anne and martin are living in their vw westfalia camper in the driveway of a hostel where they can use the toilets and showers that wouldnt be allowed in many places under lockdown but they happened to be staying there while fixing some mechanical issues when the crisis began the owners allowed them to stay and they decided to sit it out in their van  image copyright anne and martin image caption anne and martin when the going was good  for us there was never a question of leaving the van behind says anne  we also didnt really see the point of returning back to europe as the number of infected people was much higher than here we dont have a home as we moved out of our apartment and sold all our belongings we could stay at our parents places but in our mid30s its not really our goal  the days are getting really long and repetitive we are safe and healthy but we are stuck we miss being on the road she says  radka and ivar missed it too but they couldnt see a light at the end of the tunnel luckily the airport in ushuaia reopened and they booked a flight to buenos aires the van and their gear would have to stay behind but with strict rules in most countries including argentina about how long a foreignplated car can remain there they had just one day to work out the logistics and find a place to park it again through silvias network they managed to secure written permission from a resident who would allow the van to be parked at his house and a letter from the customs authorities enabling them to leave it behind until the crisis is over  it was a stressful day we really hope that everything is ok with the papers says ivar its incredible how it worked out although when we parked the van and left it there i was nervous about handing the keys over because we had never met the guy theres a part of us thats afraid we wont see the van again maybe well show up and theyll be like what car  image copyright radka and ivar image caption radka on the journey south in los

norwegian air flight to oslo costing them €1300  back in norway they had to complete 10 days of quarantine but were lucky to have access to a rural family cabin where they sat it out in peace  we have gone through all the emotions… but right now were just really happy to be back in norway says ivar  on a scale of one to 10 the disappointment is 11 says radka  the longer we stayed and the worse i felt i said ok i admit it i cant imagine spending another four months like this so im willing to spend some of our savings on going home to norway where people have a bit more freedom i was going

will give them some perspective says ivar  we would have felt worse if it was something that we should have seen coming i think we did everything we could and i am at peace with that i feel like were

the story about dominic cummings behaviour during the lockdown by handling it himself it failed completely  it certainly was not an attempt to give the public the full information  instead the prime minister refused to answer the questions that remain about the specifics of his advisers visit or visits to the north east of england while his team was telling the public again and again and again that they had to stay at home  the prime minister said repeatedly that some parts of the stories that have been reported have been palpably false  but without being specific about what is true and what is not questions will continue to be asked as a former journalist surely the prime minister knows that  one of the rules of political crisis management is that if a public figure gets rumbled you need to get all the details however gory out from under wherever they had been hiding pronto or else your opponents will just keep looking  the prime minister instead only provided one broad answer  that he himself had talked to mr cummings about why he did what he did while he was selfisolating and that was enough  and whatever is left hanging the central allegation  that his most senior adviser left lockdown while his wife was ill and travelled across the country  is true given the government has day after day told everyone to stay at home that is still extraordinary  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption boris johnson defends his senior advisor dominic cummings  the prime minister said that mr cummings was within the guidelines because of the severe challenges of finding childcare he seemed almost to be praising him for following his instinct as a good father  the problem with that is that millions of parents were told they couldnt follow their instincts  the governments lockdown rules were instructions in the words of cabinet ministers  many of the public would have loved to rely on family members if they were unlucky enough to fall ill many of the public would have loved to follow their instincts in going to visit relatives who were suffering or far away  but instead they followed the daily exhortations from the government the prime ministers appeal to the nation and stayed home instead  however hard it was  rather than acknowledging a tiny iota of conflict or fraction of fault instead mr johnson seemed to double down on what many people see as a double standard  loyal  a small troop of tory mps have already said publicly that mr cummings broke the rules and should quit and a few more have gone public since the prime minister spoke alongside some of the governments scientific advisers  several ministers are saying it privately too who feel deeply uncomfortable with what has happened and mr johnsons justification of it and many of the public may feel it is quite something to watch the prime minister seemingly reinterpret the same public health advice he has credited with saving thousands of lives to protect one of his team  one cabinet minister has a more benevolent interpretation saying the prime minister is someone who is always loyal to those who have been loyal to him  mr johnson certainly sees mr cummings as a vital part of his operation  a record forged together in the fire of the referendum campaign the chaos and brutality of their first few months in office as a minority government and then the strategy to turn red seats blue in the north of england romping home in the general election  no one doubts mr cummings ability as a campaigner and someone willing to say the unsayable  shouting in an empty room  but in government his willingness to pick fights to get things done has made him many enemies one senior official described his strategy today as shouting in an empty room  his supporters see his willingness to confront hard truths as an advantage but it means now he is under attack despite a few slavish cabinet tweets yesterday there is hardly a long queue of supporters willing to defend him  and even some of his and mr johnsons own supporters worry about how dependent the prime minister has become on one adviser how has boris johnson allowed a situation to develop where many people in government believe one aides view dominates above all else  and some are questioning tonight the willingness to splurge so much personal political capital on one advisers political survival it is abundantly clear the prime minister is determined to keep mr cummings in place  mr johnson has brazened out many difficult political situations before  simply refusing for example to answer any questions about the police being called to his and his partners flat during his bid to become prime minister  the hope in no 10 is that in time the controversy will fade but this time the misdemeanour goes against the grain of what millions of people were putting up with in lockdown at boris johnsons own instruction many of them are understandably angry  did the prime minister manage to shut this mess down today not even close']\n",

his hospital ward to whom he took pleasure in showing his tricks even those that regularly misfired  on what we thought would be his final day his favourite nurse asked him to show her the trick with

to explain how babies were made its really important she went on that you get to the bathroom first in the mornings girls take a long time getting ready  she warned me against girls too though more

1994 triggered the genocide  french investigators spied on mr kabugas children to track him down to his thirdfloor flat in the paris suburb of asnièressurseine where he had been living under a false identity using a passport from an unidentified african country  according to col eric emeraux who heads a special french police unit fighting war crimes the coronavirus pandemic also helped as the lockdown in france paralysed many operations across parts of europe freeing up time to focus on the man accused of being the main financier of the genocide  in just 100 days in 1994 about 800000

origin  the united states had offered a 5m £41m reward for information leading to mr kabugas arrest  but it was puzzling that for so many years one of the most wanted fugitives in africa with a 5m £41m us bounty on his head after being charged with seven counts of genocide and crimes against humanity in 1997 managed to live in subterfuge and evade law enforcement across countries and continents  was he harboured in kenya  mr kabuga is alleged to have lived in many countries in east africa including kenya where he and his family had business interests  kenya was for long said to be harbouring the fugitive with powerful politicians accused of thwarting efforts to arrest him  who is félicien kabuga  considered the richest man in rwanda before the 1994 genocide  made his fortune from tea in the 1970s and ventured into many other sectors at home and elsewhere  was close to the ruling mrnd party  and related by marriage to president juvénal habyarimana who died in 1994  accused of being the top sponsor of the genocide plan and using his business and premises to organise and fund the killing  the main owner of the private radio station rtlm that was accused of inciting ethnic hutus to kill tutsis  the united states had offered a reward of 5m £41m for information leading to his arrest  in 2006 the international criminal tribunal for rwanda said it had evidence that mr kabuga either visited or resided in kenya where he carried out business interests  three years later stephen rapp then us ambassadoratlarge for war crimes accused successive kenyan governments of refusing to hand over mr kabuga  there was evidence that mr kabuga even attended functions attended by influential persons he said  allegations kenya has always denied  there is no dispute that the kabuga family owned assets in kenya as one property became the subject of a court case in 2015 when his wife josephine mukazitoni who coowned it tried and failed to regain access to it  known as spanish villas it had been seized because of a un resolution requiring member states to trace and freeze mr kabugas assets  wild goose chase  media reports pointed to mr kabugas presence in kenya at different points though

genocide  his brother josephat gichuki says after his death he discovered that munuhe was planning a sting operation with the fbi to arrest mr kabuga by posing as a businessman  to our surprise police said munuhes death was a suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning after inhaling fumes from a charcoal stove mr gichuki told the bbc  while at the mortuary i personally saw a bullet wound in his head and blood in his room  image copyright reuters image caption the authorities had been searching for mr kabuga for many years  eight years later journalist john allan namu believes he was deliberately misled by a source in kenya to out the wrong person an unsuspecting businessman as mr kabuga  he feels this was done because some were unhappy about what his investigations had unearthed including evidence that mr kabuga had a kenyan bank account through which he was conducting business  the whole affair became so messy that he and his family were forced to go into hiding for months because of the death threats he was receiving  where he was arrested is a proof that kabuga survived as a fugitive for such a long time because of the connivance of people across the globe not least in kenya namu told the bbcs great lake service  the hunt  in the immediate aftermath of the genocide mr kabuga fled to switzerland but was not allowed to stay and reportedly came back to africa via kinshasa capital of the democratic republic of congo  most evidence points to his presence in kenya though mr brammertz says there had also been sightings of him in madagascar and burundi  image copyright reuters image caption mr kabugas lawyers say he wants a trial in france  but such information was always reactive so the operation that led to his arrest took a sophisticated coordinated operation with simultaneous searches across a number of locations he said  it took at least two years starting from his last known location  in germany where he had last been sighted when he went for surgery in 2007  extensive analysis of telephone and financial data eventually led them to paris  it is difficult to imagine he could have escaped into french territory without the help of accomplices says patrick baudoin of the international federation for human rights  the mystery about his whereabouts for so many years has prompted human rights watch to call for an investigation into how and who made this possible  prelockdown walks  his paris neighbours say the elderly man had lived there for about three to four years  olivier olsen head of the association of homeowners in the building where he

boris johnson had his work cut out when he asked cummings to join him in downing street last july the new prime minister described it as a “hairy” mission  one friend recalls “boris was really turning the thumbscrews on dom saying ‘you’ve got to come in you’ve got to come in’”  cummings tabled what he called a series of “terrorist demands” to the incoming prime minister after judging according to one friend that his team had monumentally failed to draw up a coherent plan  the boldest demand which was at the centre of the eventual showdown with sajid javid was to be given control of the network of special advisers the political appointees who work for cabinet ministers by controlling the special advisers cummings would gain significant leverage over cabinet ministers  to his surprise the new prime minister said yes to his demands cummings therefore entered downing street with one immediate plan  to sort out the “mess” of brexit  and a longer vision to transform the workings of government  “we are going to bulldoze our way to make sure brexit happens” was the cummings view at the time “it has to happen”  in a fraught autumn for the tory party which saw the evisceration of the proeuropean wing of the party cummings deployed his own powers sometimes without mercy  relations started to sour with javid when his special adviser sonia khan was unceremoniously and highly controversially marched out of no 10 last august after falling out with cummings the sacking of khan  who was escorted out of downing street by an armed police officer  chilled the atmosphere in whitehall javid was not even aware it was happening  cummings is not the loner he is sometimes portrayed as and knows power when he sees it on the day johnson became prime minister a scruffylooking cummings made sure to frame himself in the corner of a photo taken as the cabinet secretary and the man in charge of the civil service sir mark sedwill welcomed the new pm to no 10 sedwill could well be seen as the epitome of the sort of generalist  a career flitting between the foreign office and the home office  scorned by cummings  but gisela stuart the former labour minister who chaired the vote leave campaign who knows both men well says “i remember looking at that picture and i thought sedwill and dom have a lot in common both of them are big picture people both of them are deeply strategic both of them are terribly focused i think they want the same thing”  with the fate of brexit unknown in a hung parliament cummings advised johnson to take a risky gamble by going for an early general election  cummings is widely praised for pushing for it but was blunt about the dangers at the time “this election is very risky very risky for us” he was heard to say “anyone who says they know what is going to happen or thinks we will walk it is an idiot”  the electoral gamble paid off but cummings was unhappy – feeling that his control of special advisers had failed to impose enough discipline he was highly suspicious of the team working for javid cummings had technically taken control of the network of special advisers but they were still in effect answerable to their cabinet minister and not to him  also cummings wanted to inject new characters into the machinery of government he used a blog on 2 january to call on “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to join him in delivering the large changes in policy and decisionmaking he said were required by brexit  cummings indicated that 35000 people had answered his call they must have been attracted by the job specification in which he wrote “i don’t want confident public school bluffers i want people who are much brighter than me who can work in an extreme environment if you play office politics you will be discovered and immediately binned”  but cummings faced a rebuke from a writer cited in one of his blogs william gibson mocked cummings for appearing to liken himself to the “quasi evil genius” hubertus bigend in his novel pattern recognition “the idea of people like that being made bureaucrats is quite unnerving” gibson told the bbc  a former cabinet minister accuses cummings of ruthless tactics which have involved injecting populism into the political discourse and undermining the constitution when parliament was suspended last year david gauke who stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate in the election after he was deprived of the tory whip says “you can admire the ruthless determination to pursue a strategy which very few people would do in as determined a manner as he has done but it is a strategy which is reckless and damaging for the country in the undermining of institutions”  but the former mp sir nicholas soames who lost the tory whip at the same time as gauke admires cummings soames who eventually had the whip restored says “dominic cummings is an exceptionally gifted and clever man every government needs a disruptor governments that don’t have disruptors become complacent and run out of steam the predictable pretend loathing of cummings is totally pathetic”  but cummings has made enemies in a potentially significant camp  friends of sajid javid “the handling of sajid was gratuitous” one said “is it really wise to create a prince across the water so early on”  friends of cummings are divided on what the future holds for him as he lives with the inevitable compromises of government one says he is a pragmatist  but another says that cummings’s irritation with david cameron’s vetoing of his plan to scrap gcses shows he is prepared to walk “dom is not there to please he’s there to get stuff done if the principal boris doesn’t follow that plan he will say ‘you’re not interested in taking my advice i’m out of here’”  a divisive polemicist both charming and abrasive dominic cummings is wielding immense power in the name of a prime minister with an historic mandate it is a natural meeting of minds between two idiosyncratic political beasts with eclectic interests in the classical world and beyond  johnson summoned cummings in his first hour of need when brexit and the future of the conservative party were in jeopardy cummings was the right fit for the first phase of boris johnson in no 10 it will be a cliffhanger to see how long the match lasts']\n",

orquesta experimental de instrumentos nativos  the breathing techniques required to play these instruments for a few hours put you in a kind of trance says miguel cordoba who plays the siku flute  but as soon as the rehearsal finishes they are all too aware of how their life has changed because they are not rehearsing back home in la paz bolivia but in the shadow of a german castle where they have been stranded for 73 days  the musicians most of whom have never left bolivia before were expecting to spend just over a fortnight this spring touring east germanys concert halls  instead they are holed up in the buildings and grounds of the sprawling estate of rheinsberg palace a moated castle which has been home to generations of german royalty and aristocracy an hour and a halfs drive northwest of berlin  image copyright getty images  as the musicians some of whom are as young as 17 touched down in germany on 10 march for their tour news broke that berlin had become the seventh german region to impose a ban on gatherings of 1000 people or more in response to the coronavirus pandemic  our bus broke down on the motorway i remember joking that this was bad luck and perhaps our concerts would be cancelled recollects carlos but never did i think it would actually happen  their three planned performances were cancelled in the days that followed and as bolivias government announced it would close its borders the orchestra scrambled to get home but failed  germanys ban on mass gatherings was swiftly followed by a full lockdown meaning the musicians are only allowed to roam as far as the forest that lines the perimeter of the estate  so their free time is spent rehearsing in the nearly 600yearold palace grounds and exploring the surrounding woodland home to 23 packs of wolves  only on monday did they get the chance to step inside the castle for the first time as tours for the public reopened  its very different to my home its very beautiful says 25yearold miguel  image copyright ariel laura image caption rehearsing in the guest house of rheinsberg palace  there are worse places to be trapped when i wake up i watch the sun rise over the forest and the lake back home i only hear the sound of traffic  but despite the picturesque natural surroundings the musicians are worried they have been forgotten  we feel abandoned says carlos whos spent several thankless hours on the phone to the bolivian embassy trying to find a way to get home  the group had only been in germany for a week when bolivias president announced the countrys border was set to close within days and all international flights had been suspended  arrangements were swiftly made by the german foreign office and bolivian embassy to reserve seats on one of the last flights out of germany to south america landing in lima peru  the group was initially relieved  when we were on the way to the airport we were all in good spirits laughing and chatting says camed martela 20  but then carlos received a call to say the flight had been cancelled as the plane was not allowed to land in peru  the mood suddenly became sombre  everyone on the bus went quiet he says  from that moment the 6000 miles 9656km between germany and bolivia seemed further than ever  tracy prado who only joined the orchestra in december remembers thinking about her daughters 11th birthday which was coming up a few weeks later  i had got my hopes up and it was devastating to think i would miss this important day she says  image copyright ariel laura  the group decided the only way to cope was to put together a strict practice schedule  three hours before lunch three hours after experimenting with a fusion of traditional andean music and more contemporary genres  indigenous music is all about the principle of community  everybody can take something from what they are and offer it to the group says carlos  you feel the same as your ancestors felt when playing these traditional instruments which is a beautiful thing adds miguel whose roots stretch back to bolivias kallawaya people known for their musical healing ceremonies  some members of the orchestra speak to their families in bolivia for others communication is near impossible as internet and telephone signals are patchy outside bolivias main cities  many of the musicians play a major role in providing for their families financially and being unable to do this at the moment is exacerbating their anxiety  in an interview with bolivias flagship station radio panamericana foreign minister karen longaric was asked for her response to the orchestras case after a distraught mother of one of the musicians called in  longaric suggested the orchestra left knowing the borders were set to soon close although bolivia had not recorded a single coronavirus case on the day they left  she also said the governments priorities were elsewhere  repatriating the most vulnerable  women children sick people and the elderly  image copyright ariel laura  carlos says there seems to be little sympathy for the orchestra back in bolivia  people back home think were in a fairytale land he says rolling his eyes ive had hundreds of messages telling me to stop complaining and that im living like a princess in a german castle  camed is disappointed they have not been able to perform as planned  wed been preparing since january so i became quite depressed as i watched everything wed prepared for get taken away like this  the orchestra helped me get back on track after the death of my dad my family were so proud of me when they heard i was flying to europe to perform my countrys music  the town of just over 8000 people also called rheinsberg has largely been welcoming towards the bolivian visitors if a little bemused by their presence  when i leave the hostel alone i do feel a little selfconscious camed says sometimes i get strange looks and people stop and stare  some go further than a raised eyebrow perhaps confused by the fact that the musicians appear to be flouting germanys social distancing rules as it may not be immediately obvious that they have been allowed to classify themselves as a family unit  image copyright ariel laura  he says on one of the occasions the bolivians played a game of football on the meadow directly in front of the castle they soon found themselves surrounded by six police officers in full riot gear just short of a helmet says timo kreuser one of three german musicians who helped facilitate the tour and are staying with them  they came from from left and right and started to encircle us and things got a little tense recalls miguel  in the end they just told us that we couldnt congregate in such a large group but it wasnt too serious  the police are used to it now so they just phone me and its always resolved says timo  timo has been keen to help the musicians partly to repay the favour of their own hospitality when he was with them in la paz in october violent protests led to the resignation of the president and carlos and the orchestra helped timo evacuate to peru  generosity and offers of help have been in plentiful supply from most people  the kitchen staff at the guest house the musicians are living in come in to work wearing masks and maintain a distance from their bolivian guests  we are so grateful for the food and the roofs over our heads says tracy who speculates shes one of only a few in the group who enjoy the local delicacies  and of course they have the woodland to explore tracy says she spotted three wolves while out walking recently  i froze in fear but they were just play fighting and moved on  it is not just wolves they look out for  one of the palaces former inhabitants was frederick the great who was given ownership of the estate by his father in 1736 before he ascended to the throne and described his time at rheinsberg as his happiest years  image copyright getty images image caption the musicians are very aware of the palaces previous inhabitants including frederick the great  a close friend of frederick reflecting on his impressions of rheinsberg wrote the evenings are dedicated to music the prince has concerts in his salon where noone is admitted unless called one of those who performed was reportedly jc bach  we all joke that fredericks ghost is following us and trying to trip us up says camed i dont usually believe in such things but it does feel as if there are ghosts on the grounds  as the seasons shifted from early spring to summer the musicians heavy clothes packed in anticipation of colder weather were too warm for their long walks around the estate  but a concerned bolivian expat in hamburg has helped out on this front  she collected mountains of clothes and sent them to us we have seven big boxes so far  perhaps too many we may need to return some or pass them onto someone else in need says carlos  but despite the generosity and good will the orchestra worries that its stay cannot be bankrolled forever  accommodation costs are mounting to more than €35000 38400 a month alone says berno odo polzer the director of maerzmusik the festival at which the orchestra were set to perform it is one of several publicly funded arts programmes which has supported the orchestras longer than expected stay  germany is allowing international flights again but bolivias borders remain shut for the foreseeable future  the bolivian embassy told the bbc it is trying to get the orchestra on a flight to bolivia in early june out of madrid  but carlos is worried about how things will be once they return too  covid is getting very political back home says carlos  the bolivian government delayed the presidential election that was due in march and later tried and failed to force through a decree limiting freedom of expression and criticisms over the handling of the coronavirus crisis  im dreaming of the day i will be at my bed in bolivia and say ok this is over but i also know that on that day i will start missing what is happening here admits carlos  all images subject to copyright']\n",

almost eight in every 100000 workers died this rate is 17 times the national average according to a 2019 hse report  it is among the uk’s most lucrative industries worth an estimated £7bn a year to the economy in recent years it has enjoyed a boom demand has been driven by rising metal prices a shortage of landfill sites and laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in them  mr cooper says the recycling industry “exploits migrant labour for enormous profits”  daniel lemberger cooper said the mens deaths raised issues for every worker in britain daniel lemberger cooper said the mens deaths raised issues for every worker in britain  “there is a now huge demand for recycling and the industry is getting bigger and bigger and these workers will be needed more and more” he says  “the five men were honest hardworking and decent human beings  “the conditions in which these workers were employed of precarious employment zerohours contracts temporary and agency work the socalled gig economy and exploitation and issues of low pay and long hours are spreading throughout the economy” he adds  “this is an issue for every worker in britain”  leading safety experts say the standard of the uk’s health and safety enforcement has declined over the past decade  after years of cuts there are fewer inspectors carrying out fewer inspections leaving many workplaces unsafe they say  shredmet had not been inspected by the hse since the 2010 accident in which an employee injured their arm  lawrence waterman chairman of the british safety council says the hse has been underresourced since the days of the coalition government  in 2010 the government imposed 33 cuts on the hse then in 2012 the prime minister david cameron stated the uks excessive health and safety culture was costing businesses billions and he intended to kill it off for good  after the conservatives won the general election in 2015 further cuts followed in the spending review later that year  lawrence waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe lawrence waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe  “it’s not just resources that have had an impact” says mr waterman  it’s the political hangover of now two prime ministers ago who wanted to kill health and safety with a feeling that red tape ruled and we were being told how to live our lives  “well the other side of that is that five guys never came home to their families  “hanging over businesses and the government is the need to be honest and place more value on looking after people at work”  hilda palmer from the hazards campaign which promotes workplace safety says a disproportionately large number of those killed or injured at work are immigrants  “unfortunately if you look at the names of the people that are killed they are mostly foreignsounding names  eastern europeans and now west african” she says  “i also know of a case involving some peruvians it seems it’s the new wave of migrants that get drawn in  the most vulnerable”  flowers left at the site of the accident in 2016 flowers left at the site of the accident in 2016  she says legislation enforcement and trade unions have all been “attacked through the cuts”  “that creates an environment for cowboys to flourish” she added “if employers see checks being done prosecutions fines and notices being issued that reminds them to act”  the conservatives declined to comment but vince cable the former liberal democrat leader who was a member of the coalition cabinet says the global financial crisis was to blame  “austerity was going to happen whatever government came in” he says  “the cuts labour chancellor alistair darling had were the same as what the coalition did and this was as a result of the huge financial crisis and reduced revenue that the country found itself in”  laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling  the dead mens families remain bewildered that three years after the accident the hse has still not decided whether or not to charge shredmet  mr waterman says the slowness of the hse investigation is due to its underfunding the hse aims to complete 80 of fatal investigations within one year but in 201819 just 65 were  “when you look at that it’s not unreasonable for the families to feel that justice is being denied” mr waterman says  “if the families of the five guys were pluggedin middleclass agitators there may have been more pressure being felt to keep the hse focused on finding out what happened”  “if immediate legislative change is not enacted there are going to be more injuries and further deaths”  the hse says the families’ demand for a speedy conclusion is “understandable” but it needs to ensure its investigation is “thorough”  “as with many complex challenging criminal investigations relating to multiple fatalities following new lines of inquiry and forensically examining evidence can mean investigations take longer than families would understandably hope” a spokesman says  “since the inquests concluded our time and energy has been fully focused on reviewing the case bringing together evidence heard by the coroner and concluding the criminal investigation  “we are working hard to resolve any delays and have endeavoured to give regular updates to the families where possible”  the families lawyer believes they are the victims of a legal system that does not treat deaths at work with the same seriousness as other fatalities  “the criminal justice system fails to treat deaths and injuries at work – unlike deaths in almost any other setting – as the possible outcome of serious crimes and this must urgently change” mr cooper says  he wants the government to legislate to prevent the exploitation of workers  “a fitting tribute and legacy to those that died would be that immediate steps are taken by government to ensure that we learn the lessons of why these men died so that noone else suffers like they have” he says  “if immediate legislative change is not enacted there are going to be more injuries and further deaths the government and employers will have blood on their hands”']\n",

hooked up to a ventilator in a covid ward  rajesh was being treated in northwick park hospital in london the city where he worked as an uber driver for most of the year mary was 5000 miles away in their family home in bangalore india with their two young sons until that point he had repeatedly told her he would be fine that he was feeling ill but she was not to worry hed get better  at 44 years old he was young and otherwise healthy  but on that call he broke down and admitted mary im feeling a bit scared  rajesh jayaseelan died the following day  rajesh and mary got married on 24 february 2014 and rented a home in hulimavu south bangalore that they shared with his 66yearold mum for most of the year rajesh rented a room in harrow north london and drove an uber vehicle in the city hed work from late in the evening to the early hours of the morning  the busy hours  so he could save enough money to spend a few months with his family in india  he enjoyed working as a driver although he didnt realise that his precarious gig economy job would leave him vulnerable in the global health crisis that would later emerge  hed been living in london onandoff for 22 years and would come back to india for a few months at a time mary says he loved london he always used to talk to me about how beautiful london was and so clean ive never been to london so he would describe it to me  they were very happy rajesh loved his wife and playing with their two sons aged six and four when he wasnt in india he would videocall them every day  he was also a really good singer mary says full of pride he sang a lot of hindi songs  he was also a humble gentle person his close friend sunil kumar adds sunil and rajesh first met in 2011  they were both from bangalore so mutual friends there put them in touch when sunil moved to the uk they would help each other navigate the uks various bureaucratic systems loaned each other small amounts of money when needed and sunil and his wife would have rajesh over for meals at their home in hertfordshire  sending him back with several days worth of leftovers of delicious south indian food  although rajesh loved london he didnt plan to stay forever  he wanted to be reunited with his family in india renting their home in hulimavu was relatively expensive so during his last stay in bangalore at the end of 2019 he and his wife took out a loan and bought land to build their own home the loan was no problem they thought  rajesh would go back to london and put enough money aside to pay it off the next time he travelled to bangalore he told his wife it would be for good  he came back to london on 15 january less than two weeks later the first cases of coronavirus were reported in the uk  image copyright mary jayaseelan image caption rajesh and mary on their wedding day in february 2014  although the virus had reached britain at this point rajesh wasnt too worried shops and restaurants were still open people were still going into work and then going out for everyone including uber drivers it was business as usual and not much changed for another month  then march came around and the virus was passing from person to person within the uk the number of cases  and by now deaths  was increasing every day people were told to selfisolate for seven days if they had any symptoms  even mild ones such as a fever or a persistent cough  on 23 march prime minister boris johnson announced a nationwide lockdown lasting an initial three weeks meaning that most businesses would close and people would only be allowed outside for one form of exercise a day and for essential trips to the shops unless they were considered essential workers  like many uber drivers rajesh continued to work at first but he quickly developed flulike symptoms and had to stop his last job was on 25 march  a dropoff at heathrow airport  his symptoms became much worse and he was admitted to the hospital with dehydration while there he was tested for the coronavirus  it came back positive  staff told rajesh to go home selfisolate and to come back if his symptoms got worse he did as he was told and went home to his room but things were about to get even worse  the landlord sent rajesh out of the house for something and when he came back the landlord had changed the locks so he couldnt get in mary says he tried knocking on the door and asking the landlord to speak to him but he wouldnt open the door  his landlord didnt know about his positive diagnosis  but he told him that as an uber driver he might bring the coronavirus back into the house and that it wasnt a risk he was willing to take  with nowhere else to turn rajesh was forced to sleep in his car for several nights  he had no food in there nothing to eat at all mary says  at this point he called his friend sunil for advice  image copyright mary jayaseelan  that was the last call he made to me sunil says he didnt go into details about what was happening to him but because i work in the nhs he was asking me questions like how safe are we is it better to go to india… things like that he was asking me if i knew any routes if there was any possible way he could go  he wanted to go to india and be with his family but by that time there was a complete lockdown in india too  sunil told him the best thing to do would be to stay at home not to work and to look into the financial support for selfemployed workers the government had just announced or the 14 days assistance offered by uber  rajesh agreed and explained he needed to find a new place to live because his landlord said he was high risk but sunil says he didnt say that hed already been kicked out he may have been embarrassed  rajesh then went back to trying to call his landlord to plead with him to let him stay there was no answer  after days of searching he eventually found another room in a shared house in harrow the new landlord made him pay £4000 upfront  money he didnt have and mary says he had to borrow  what if this happens to me  if your landlord kicks you out of your home without giving you notice or locks you out of your home it is likely to be an illegal eviction  a criminal offence in all uk nations  this is still the case during the coronavirus pandemic under the coronavirus act notice periods for evictions have been extended to three months  this means that for most private and social tenants even if they receive an eviction notice theyre likely to have the legal right to stay in their home andy parnell helpline adviser for housing charity shelter tells the bbc  but he says sadly there are some groups not protected by the recent changes to the evictions law including lodgers with livein landlords  lodgers have fewer rights than private renters with liveout landlords and landlords dont need to go to court to evict a lodger but they are required to provide reasonable notice before asking them to leave the property  people in rajeshs situation should call the local councils homelessness team as soon as possible and all councils have an emergency outofhours number if you dont have anywhere to sleep you should go to the councils office in person bringing id and any proof of immigration status with you  earlier this month shelter also told renters in this situation to stay put  once rajesh was back indoors he didnt want to risk being evicted again he hid himself away and avoided contact with his new landlord and all the other tenants not even daring to try and cook a meal for himself his health became worse with every passing day the only social interaction he had were daily phone calls with his wife where he would alternate between reassuring her that he would be fine and crying  it was during one of these calls that mary noticed he was struggling to breathe  he was wheezing a lot in that room and every day it was getting worse she says one night i told him to go to the hospital he didnt want to call an ambulance because he didnt want others there to know he was ill in case he was evicted again  rajesh drove himself to the hospital despite being severely out of breath when he got there he was diagnosed with pneumonia  the next morning he called me from the hospital for a video call  but when the children saw him they started crying because of how ill he was mary says he turned off his video and told me he didnt want them to remember him looking so unwell they would speak only a few more times  on 11 april the doctors caring for rajesh called mary and explained that he was in a critical state and they didnt think his condition would improve they arranged a video call for her and the children to see him one final time he was unconscious he died two hours later  while coronavirus doesnt discriminate has been repeated often during this pandemic it is evident that the virus is worse for some than others one group hit particularly hard are gig economy workers  the gig economy is where people take on shortterm or freelance work instead of permanent jobs these include privatehire cab drivers like rajesh as well as food delivery workers and couriers last year about 47 million people in the uk worked in gig economy jobs while according to a 2018 study 60 of the global population is in insecure work  research by the world economic forum and other bodies shows these workers are disproportionately affected by the pandemic  a combination of being classified as essential workers requiring them to continue interacting with strangers a lack of guaranteed paid sick leave that makes it harder to selfisolate low and insecure pay making it more likely for them to be living in dangerous and insecure housing situations and no entitlement to risk assessments or protective equipment  ayako ebata from the institute of development studies says because people in insecure work heavily rely on their daily wages they are under a lot of pressure not to lose their jobs or take time off even when there are significant health risks  its not because theyre ignorant or uninformed its because the whole system is forcing them to make decisions that eventually prove detrimental to their livelihoods and health she says  image copyright mary jayaseelan  dr alex wood a sociologist at oxford university focusing on the gig economy and insecure work agrees  and says a lack of workplace protection makes the problem much worse  people have been told by these platforms that they dont need to worry about rights and protections because when the economys fine there isnt really any risk he says in reality when you have these crises its the workers who pay  despite many of them now being classified as essential  now drivers in the uk are calling for greater protection from the government united private hire drivers uphd an independent trade body for privatehire drivers has this week called for an urgent judicial review on the matter  what the government is saying now is that its not safe for you to go to a barbershop but its somehow safe for you to ride around in an uber james farrar from the uphd says  race is a risk factor too according to multiple recent studies bame people in the uk like rajesh are disproportionately more likely to be in insecure work than their white counterparts  research from the trade union congress tuc last year found that ethnic minority workers are a third more likely to be in insecure work a report released last month by carnegie uk trust ucl and operation black vote also found that bame millennials in particular were 47 more likely to be on zerohours contracts  another notoriously unstable form of work  at the same time recent studies show that bame people in the uk are disproportionately more likely to become critically ill and to die from coronavirus ethnic minority patients make up 34 of those in intensive care despite making up only 13 of the population  early research suggests this is down to a combination of risk factors  an increased incidence of highrisk underlying health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension as well as social factors and systemic inequality  coronavirus is making a lot of the inequalities in our society that we had previously turned a blind eye to very clear dr wood says  after learning that her son had died rajeshs mother became ill she suffered hypertension and a spike in her blood sugar level and has been confined to her bed shes been inconsolable since mary says  faced with a loan for the house upcoming medical bills and childrens school fees mary is trying to find work as a cleaner in their area but the lockdown is making it much more difficult to get on top of their finances  sunil is helping them with money where he can and has set up an online fundraiser for them hes also looking into whether he can pursue legal action against rajeshs first landlord and marys relatives in bangalore have set up a fundraiser for her in india uber also contacted the bbc to offer their condolences  but more than anything mary is struggling to come to terms with how quickly everything has changed for her family  now that rajesh is gone our life has become very difficult she says i dont know what well do without him']\n",

further afield in australia these kitchen gardens became popularised in world war one and world war two when shortages reached critical levels in the allied nations in response governments coordinated domestic campaigns calling upon citizens to fuel the war effort and feed the country working the soil became a patriotic duty  in the uk most widely remembered is the “dig for victory” campaign launched by the british ministry of agriculture in 1939 it was so successful that the number of allotments grew to 17 million in just three years while private gardens with vegetable produce numbered five million  food prices are going up and fresh produce is going to be at a premium  during the same period a horticultural magazine paraphrased napoleon’s claim that the english were a nation of shopkeepers instead writing “we might with equal justice be called a nation of gardeners” the claim stuck our obsession with gardening stretches far beyond a national pastime it is rooted in the british psyche the garden is considered a private sanctuary but also a site of creative expression and personal pride as reflected in the highly competitive british annual “giant vegetable” competitions that spring up from harrogate to carmarthenshire for britons growing our own produce has the added value of bringing locals together  victory gardens were also not just about food cultivating fruit and vegetables boosted morale and built momentum growing for the greater good banded together communities and enabled those stuck at home to play a part however small perhaps this is why the gardens’ legacy can still be felt today while using the analogy of war to describe a viral pandemic is controversial it makes sense that we‘ve connected the two moments in time it is the sense of community spirit we want to revive – and a victory garden quite literally says we are in this together  beyond caring for our own families greenfingered types are sharing produce with their neighbours a survey commissioned by the british charity rsa cited that 42 of respondents feel the outbreak has made them value food more and 10 have shared supplies for the first time  i first noticed the neighbourly potential of plants three weeks after lockdown had begun when a neighbour i hardly knew knocked on the door of my house in suffolk when i answered she leapt behind the gate “alpine strawberries” she yelled “plant them in partial shade” a week later a trio of pepper seedlings appeared – another gift to say thank you i delivered fat garlicky leaves of wild ransom foraged between bluebells in a nearby woodland now we swap excited texts about her egglaying tortoise rosie since then i check what jeanie and her husband john would like from the shops why i waited for a pandemic to do this is beyond me  outside their gate a sign offers willowherb and more wild strawberries – anything surplus they don’t need “if someone likes something in your garden you can just take a cutting for them” john said “it doesn’t cost you anything”  the bristol seed swap has been promoting the circular economy of seed saving for years a few days after lockdown they advertised leftover seed packets from a previous event which the public could request free of charge by sending a selfaddressed stamped envelope diane holness a spokesperson for the nonprofit said swells of gardeners were in touch with requests “we sent seeds to around 150 people” she said “i think everyone is aware that food prices are going up and that fresh produce is going to be at a premium”  the most requested seeds were tomato adaptable and easy to grow “i think they are one crop that can fit into even the tiniest space even a balcony” she said  luckily the organisation had plenty as holness said harvesting seeds costs you nothing but goes a long way to helping someone else “if you know how you could almost save enough cabbage seeds for everyone in the city”  two hours west of bristol west dorset’s foodie capital bridport has been a hive of activity since lockdown created in response to quarantine the bridport grow your own community facebook group has played a large role in greening the town just as the 1930s dig for victory leaflets relayed growing information online groups are helping new growers by circulating plant wisdom  “as a town i think we are all at it” environmentalist and educator kim squirrel told me “people have dug up their gardens and others are growing in pots” she works a private allotment on the town’s edge shared between 10 houses that includes her neighbour rachel millson both have turned their full attention to growing with news of the lockdown squirrel’s potager garden is crammed with brassicas alongside beans french to dwarf winding up bamboo stalks that are also homegrown pear and espalier apple trees will fruit come the summer  millson’s garden exploits are equally impressive overwintering crops such as earthy beetroot onion and leeks fill up one plot another bed is an experiment in perennial vegetables such as asparagus that take less carbon from the soil  “the pandemic has cemented in my mind the need to be growing more food not just for my own family and to save money but for the wider community” millson said  she feels fortunate to have an allotment but wishes there was more recognition that growing your own food isn’t just a pastime but “real important work” millson strongly believes it has personal benefits and also aids community wellbeing preempting that food inequality is going to be at an alltime high she has purposefully grown extra vegetable crops with a mind to donate them to a local foodbank  part of the fun of growing your own produce is in sharing your hardearned bounty with family and friends but while delivering your overzealous courgette crop is practical there is something special in giving someone a plant they can cultivate themselves  we have common ground now something other than the fear around the pandemic  bruno white had just moved to ditcheat somerset when the uk went into lockdown on 23 march he wrote to his new neighbours to introduce himself and set up an informal mutual aid group one elderly gentleman he shopped for was so grateful that he left a collection of plants on white’s doorstep each with handwritten instructions shortly afterwards another thankful neighbour gifted him packets of biodynamic seeds “he taught us about three sisters its a traditional native american method you grow corn then beans to climb up it then squash to shade and stifle any weeds”  white has since been cultivating his garden and has been surprised at how easy it is – and how kind his neighbours are “we have common ground now something other than the fear around the pandemic” he said  while the early days of the covid19 pandemic were filled with panic hopefully it will be the incredible displays of neighbourly spirit that we will remember the victory garden movement of the world wars not only helped strengthen communities but also gave homebound individuals a chance to contribute to those fighting on the front line amid a pandemic the vegetable garden has similar appeal it offers a sustainable solution to food security that not only helps us but allows us to care for our neighbours too  at a time of uncertainty and confusion even planting a lettuce seed can offer a

corner shoppe  stan came from a long line of jewish bread bakers as a child he would wake up before dawn to fry doughnuts at his fathers little philadelphia bakery finishing them off with a generous coating of granulated sugar when people came in to buy a loaf of bread in the morning theyd pick up one of stans doughnuts too  he later learned how to make intricate europeaninspired pastries  the corner shoppe had equipment for baking but when stan first took over it only sold other peoples food  then fate stepped in  one sunday morning when the shop was closed stan popped in to clean up and noticing the heavy footfall in the area saw an opportunity he called a friend in the bakery business who brought him flour yeast and everything else he needed  he made a piece of dough and fried a batch of doughnuts then sold them through the shops window  it soon became a routine every sunday stan would head into work at about 0400 to make doughnuts his wife would drive his three children down a few hours later to sell his creations and with the money they made the family would go out for dinner in the evening  image copyright stans donuts image caption stan invented dozens of doughnuts over the years  on monday mornings people started coming in looking for doughnuts  theyd say stan why arent you making doughnuts stan now 90 recalls and id say well you know were not really doing that then before you know it we were doing that  the corner shoppe became the corner donut shoppe and eventually stans donuts  doughnuts were considered at the lowend of the bakery business but stan applied the techniques for making fine pastries learned in his youth to create a new product  they were so different from most doughnuts even though i used the same flour and shortenings and toppings he says  my idea was im going to make something you really like tell me what you like and im going to try and make something for you as a doughnut so you will come in for yours  i did that for hundreds of people  he packed his array of flavours  cherry chocolate cinnamon peanut butter  into a display case that blasted people when they walked into the tiny room  before long stan was selling thousands of doughnuts every day  image copyright stans donuts image caption stans donuts is located at the heart of las westwood village  his growing reputation and proximity to the two la cinemas meant some of hollywoods biggest stars were among his customers  when one of her movies was playing across the road actress ali macgraw and her partner steve mcqueen would frequently drive up to stans shop on a motorcycle get a cup of coffee and a doughnut and sit outside on the kerb to watch people going into the cinema  elizabeth taylor  one of hollywoods most glamorous women  ordered coffee and doughnuts with a group of friends not that stan recognised her  a passerby pointed her out  willy wonka actor gene wilder and hollywood filmmaker mel brooks were also regulars but stan had one rule he never took photos of the stars coming into his shop  i wanted them to be comfortable to come in and share my doughnuts he says  cementing its place in hollywood history the shops original signage was restored for a scene in quentin tarantinos 2019 film once upon a time in hollywood  in more recent years stans donuts has been frequented by a nobel laureate and senior staff at the nearby ucla  as well as many students  image copyright stans donuts image caption stan says he tried to create a doughnut to suit every taste  for generations numerous ucla departments have shared boxes of stans donuts to celebrate special occasions myriad student groups have sold them as fundraisers for worthy causes and so many on our campus have had their days brightened by one or more of your delicious treats the chancellor of the university gene block said in a recent letter to stan  when the animated show the simpsons turned 20 producers ordered batches of stans homer simpson doughnuts  pink frosting sprinkles  for fox affiliates  simpsons writer carolyn omine tweeted that the shop was among her first memories of la stans cherry cheesecake doughnut was her favourite  while the doughnuts themselves might have been the biggest reason for the shops success stan also became a star in his own right and he revelled in the attention  we would bump into people all over the world people who knew us from the doughnut shop he recalls with glee we couldnt go to a movie we couldnt go anywhere where someone wouldnt tap me on the shoulder and say hey stan  his shops success and longevity earned it iconic status in la the city declared 3 may 2014 stans donuts day and the shop was named a monumental business  image copyright stans donuts image caption stan says his family and his doughnut shop were the most important things in his life  looking back stan says he has had the most unbelievable life and it all came from the doughnut shop  he believes part of his success was due to him always being the finisher even in old age he would go into the shop every day  hed make the icing clean the pots and sweep the floors  he was a perfectionist and expected the same attention to detail from his small team of staff his favourite doughnut was his raisin buttermilk bar because as soon as he took a bite he could tell whether the fryer had been cleaned  it was also the doughnut hed give away to customers after a friendly chat at his shop he gave away plenty over the years  he could never bear to throw any away at the end of the day  but as well as being responsible for his successes he says there were one or two events in his life where his shop caused problems  stans first employee was a close friend called norman together they were known as the doughnut men but the pair fell out when stan missed normans wifes funeral because he was making doughnuts they were never able to reconcile  the problem was that the shop was so important to me that i couldnt see other things around stan says  stan was still frying doughnuts into his 80s but he had a stroke about three years ago and was forced to take a step back from his business going to the shop once a week with his son without stan there every day sales were not what they used to be  despite the struggles stan hoped that he would still have the business when he turned 100 but he couldnt have anticipated the coronavirus pandemic or the impact it would have on his little shop in la  restaurants in the city were ordered to close in midmarch in a bid to slow the spread of the virus with only takeaways and deliveries allowed ucla moved its classes online sales dropped dramatically  since 2014 stan has been making money in royalties from stans donuts  coffee  a successful line of shops in chicago with a range of doughnuts inspired by his westwood creations but that money has dried up in recent months with business there also suffering under the pandemic  with so much uncertainty about the virus stan and his family worried how long it would go on for  we did a bit of business maybe 40 but 40 didnt pay the labour stan says  his daughter pam says coronavirus killed the business  we had to make the choice of whether to stay open by going into my fathers savings and it wasnt worth it she explains without the pandemic we would have continued the store would have stayed open until my father passed away  for pam it has left a sweet and sour feeling  it was so much aggravation trying to run the store without my father there  thats what made it a bit easier to close the doors but its been very sad  with a stayathome order in place in la there was no party to bid farewell to the shop when it closed its doors in april  image copyright stans donuts image caption stans wife ina passed away earlier this year  stan has been left to settle reluctantly into retirement while trying to come to terms with losing the two loves of his life  his doughnut shop and his wife of 68 years ina who passed away in january  he has received scores of letters from people mourning the loss of the shop and celebrating their memories there he likens it to witnessing his own obituary  his grandson who has a tattoo of the shops logo took the equipment and is now learning to make doughnuts himself  its not going to be stans donuts but he wants to continue my fathers legacy with making and selling doughnuts thats what hes hoping to do pam says  at the westwood village shop a note announcing its closure remains stuck to a window  a quiet end to a business loved by so many  i hope that you will remember how our

            "['166', 'could you have to pay your bank to save money', 'image copyright getty images image caption high street banks in countries with negative interest rates have so far been reluctant to pass them on to customers  countries are being forced to use extreme measures to keep the economy afloat amid the coronavirus crisis  now the bank of england has signalled that it may take the cost of borrowing below zero  last month the bank started new work on how negative interest rates could affect banks and the wider economy  but what exactly are negative interest rates and could a world where savers are penalised and borrowers rewarded end up doing more harm than good  what are negative interest rates  the term interest rates is often used interchangeably with the bank of england base rate  described as the single most important interest rate in the uk the base rate determines how much interest the bank of england pays to financial institutions that hold money with it and what it charges them to borrow  high street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage  the bank of england usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less  it cut them to a fresh low of 01 in march to try to stimulate the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic  in theory taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect but in practice its a bit more complicated  after all why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money when they can keep the cash at home for free  why might this happen now  the bank of englands number one job is to keep prices across the economy rising steadily every year  this is known as the banks inflation target which is set at 2 by the government  inflation as measured by the consumer prices index cpi fell to 08 in april from 15 in march  while this means the pound in your pocket stretches further right now if inflation remains low for too long bosses start factoring that into pay reviews this can then dampen consumer confidence and spending  central banks have been cutting interest rates to spur inflation for years but as rates approached zero across the developed world a handful went a step further  sweden switzerland japan and the 19 nations of the eurozone all took interest rates below zero  in switzerland negative interest rates have also helped to discourage investors from pouring money into the country during times of uncertainty  how will this affect savers  british savers have already seen their returns dwindle in recent years  the average uk instant access account pays just 045 according to the bank of england while accounts that require you to lock your money away currently offer an average return of less than 1  in countries with subzero interest rates commercial banks have passed them on to big companies  however the evidence suggests there is a much higher bar to pass the pain on to ordinary savers  christina nyman chief economist at swedish lender handelsbanken says charging savers to put money in their own accounts is seen as taboo in sweden  she says competition is fierce and households are ready to move their money to another bank so nobody wants to lose business  swiss banks ubs and credit suisse only impose negative rates on deposits of more than 2 million swiss francs  in germany where some banks impose charges on deposits of more than €100000 £90000 some people have started stashing their money in vaults  image copyright getty images image caption german demand for bank vaults has risen since the european central bank introduced negative interest rates  according to germanys central bank physical cash holdings by families and businesses there have almost trebled to €434bn since the european central bank ecb introduced a negative deposit rate in 2014  but david oxley at capital economics says there hasnt been a wider shift towards cash because most people still prefer the security and convenience of keeping it in the bank  putting it in a vault runs the risk of the money either being lost stolen or damaged he says bank deposits cannot catch fire but banknotes can  what about borrowers  negative rate mortgages already exist last year danish bank jyske announced that it would effectively pay borrowers 05 a year to take out a 10year loan  james pomeroy an economist at hsbc says this was only possible because of the nature of the mortgage market  when someone in denmark applies for a home loan danish banks act as a middleman between potential borrowers and investors  in denmark the banks dont take the hit investors do says mr pomeroy banks are then charging higher product fees so have actually made money off of this  but negative rate mortgages are unlikely to be offered in the uk any time soon  when uk interest rates were slashed to 05 in march 2009 some borrowers thought they could be in line for a payment  around 1500 cheltenham and gloucester customers had a mortgage that tracked 101 percentage points below the bank of england base rate  but any prospect of a windfall was quickly dashed when financial regulators described interest payments as a oneway obligation on the borrower  image copyright matt cardy image caption around 1500 cheltenham  gloucester borrowers did not benefit from negative interest rates when the bank of england slashed rates to 05 in 2009  what are the side effects of negative interest rates  negative interest rates hit bank earnings by squeezing the gap between the money they make on loans and what they pay to savers  if not passed on to customers negative rates would hurt bank profitability especially at a time when they are expected to be hit by crisisrelated loan losses says danae kyriakopoulou chief economist at the official monetary and financial institutions forum omfif  negative interest rates pose a particular challenge to building societies which hold around £1 of every £5 in british savings accounts  while commercial banks can access cheaper borrowing by tapping financial markets building societies must raise at least half their funding from individual savers  image copyright nationwide image caption building societies like the nationwide look after £1 in every £5 of british savings  the bank of england is in the process of assessing the impact of negative rates on uk bank and building society profits as well as how they affect insurers and pension funds  it is examining whether changing a scheme that rewards small business lending with access to cheap money or shielding a share of the money high street lenders park at the central bank from negative rates can help to offset the hit to profits  ms kyriakopoulou says more work needs to be done before negative rates can be deployed in the uk  one advantage in the uk compared to say the euro area is that weve seen strong coordination between the treasury and the independent bank of england in terms of their crisis response measures she adds  provided negative rates were also accompanied by continued support to the banking sector this would help cushion the negative impact of the policy on the banking sector']\n",

            "['194', 'could you have to pay your bank to save money', 'image copyright getty images image caption high street banks in countries with negative interest rates have so far been reluctant to pass them on to customers  countries are being forced to use extreme measures to keep the economy afloat amid the coronavirus crisis  now the bank of england has signalled that it may take the cost of borrowing below zero  last month the bank started new work on how negative interest rates could affect banks and the wider economy  but what exactly are negative interest rates and could a world where savers are penalised and borrowers rewarded end up doing more harm than good  what are negative interest rates  the term interest rates is often used interchangeably with the bank of england base rate  described as the single most important interest rate in the uk the base rate determines how much interest the bank of england pays to financial institutions that hold money with it and what it charges them to borrow  high street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage  the bank of england usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less  it cut them to a fresh low of 01 in march to try to stimulate the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic  in theory taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect but in practice its a bit more complicated  after all why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money when they can keep the cash at home for free  why might this happen now  the bank of englands number one job is to keep prices across the economy rising steadily every year  this is known as the banks inflation target which is set at 2 by the government  inflation as measured by the consumer prices index cpi fell to 08 in april from 15 in march  while this means the pound in your pocket stretches further right now if inflation remains low for too long bosses start factoring that into pay reviews this can then dampen consumer confidence and spending  central banks have been cutting interest rates to spur inflation for years but as rates approached zero across the developed world a handful went a step further  sweden switzerland japan and the 19 nations of the eurozone all took interest rates below zero  in switzerland negative interest rates have also helped to discourage investors from pouring money into the country during times of uncertainty  how will this affect savers  british savers have already seen their returns dwindle in recent years  the average uk instant access account pays just 045 according to the bank of england while accounts that require you to lock your money away currently offer an average return of less than 1  in countries with subzero interest rates commercial banks have passed them on to big companies  however the evidence suggests there is a much higher bar to pass the pain on to ordinary savers  christina nyman chief economist at swedish lender handelsbanken says charging savers to put money in their own accounts is seen as taboo in sweden  she says competition is fierce and households are ready to move their money to another bank so nobody wants to lose business  swiss banks ubs and credit suisse only impose negative rates on deposits of more than 2 million swiss francs  in germany where some banks impose charges on deposits of more than €100000 £90000 some people have started stashing their money in vaults  image copyright getty images image caption german demand for bank vaults has risen since the european central bank introduced negative interest rates  according to germanys central bank physical cash holdings by families and businesses there have almost trebled to €434bn since the european central bank ecb introduced a negative deposit rate in 2014  but david oxley at capital economics says there hasnt been a wider shift towards cash because most people still prefer the security and convenience of keeping it in the bank  putting it in a vault runs the risk of the money either being lost stolen or damaged he says bank deposits cannot catch fire but banknotes can  what about borrowers  negative rate mortgages already exist last year danish bank jyske announced that it would effectively pay borrowers 05 a year to take out a 10year loan  james pomeroy an economist at hsbc says this was only possible because of the nature of the mortgage market  when someone in denmark applies for a home loan danish banks act as a middleman between potential borrowers and investors  in denmark the banks dont take the hit investors do says mr pomeroy banks are then charging higher product fees so have actually made money off of this  but negative rate mortgages are unlikely to be offered in the uk any time soon  when uk interest rates were slashed to 05 in march 2009 some borrowers thought they could be in line for a payment  around 1500 cheltenham and gloucester customers had a mortgage that tracked 101 percentage points below the bank of england base rate  but any prospect of a windfall was quickly dashed when financial regulators described interest payments as a oneway obligation on the borrower  image copyright matt cardy image caption around 1500 cheltenham  gloucester borrowers did not benefit from negative interest rates when the bank of england slashed rates to 05 in 2009  what are the side effects of negative interest rates  negative interest rates hit bank earnings by squeezing the gap between the money they make on loans and what they pay to savers  if not passed on to customers negative rates would hurt bank profitability especially at a time when they are expected to be hit by crisisrelated loan losses says danae kyriakopoulou chief economist at the official monetary and financial institutions forum omfif  negative interest rates pose a particular challenge to building societies which hold around £1 of every £5 in british savings accounts  while commercial banks can access cheaper borrowing by tapping financial markets building societies must raise at least half their funding from individual savers  image copyright nationwide image caption building societies like the nationwide look after £1 in every £5 of british savings  the bank of england is in the process of assessing the impact of negative rates on uk bank and building society profits as well as how they affect insurers and pension funds  it is examining whether changing a scheme that rewards small business lending with access to cheap money or shielding a share of the money high street lenders park at the central bank from negative rates can help to offset the hit to profits  ms kyriakopoulou says more work needs to be done before negative rates can be deployed in the uk  one advantage in the uk compared to say the euro area is that weve seen strong coordination between the treasury and the independent bank of england in terms of their crisis response measures she adds  provided negative rates were also accompanied by continued support to the banking sector this would help cushion the negative impact of the policy on the banking sector']\n",

measures taken by governments in response to covid19 say scientists  the most comprehensive account yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys  but the authors are worried that as people return to work car use will soar again  they fear co2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis  they are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real durable changes on transport and personal mobility  in the uk transport secretary grant shapps has pledged £250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure other countries are also looking at similar plans  the lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to covid19 have had a significant impact on the carbonproducing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do  road transport has declined hugely as has aviation  however now that the uk is beginning to return to work mr shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport should walking or cycling not be an option  if you cant walk or cycle but you do have access to a car please use it rather than travelling by bus train or tram he said  industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed  now in detailed analysis researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of co2  theyve calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97 of global emissions  during the peak of the crisis in early april daily emissions dropped by 17 compared to the previous year meaning around 17 million tonnes less co2 were emitted every day  the key to the fall has been cars surface transport emissions have declined by 43 the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined  while the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact it only accounts for 10 of the decrease during the pandemic  china has been responsible for the biggest drop followed by the us europe and india  if some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year then global emissions will likely drop by 7  if prepandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by midjune the annual fall would be around 4  but the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound especially on the roads could see a carbon surge  analysis  roger harrabin environment analyst  lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants too one of the uks leading experts prof frank kelly from kings college london said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised  fully two years before us authorities exposed the scandal  he told radio 4s the life scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road  prof kelly said he reported it to the department for environment food and rural affairs defra but they didnt publish his findings he said work undertaken subsequently in the us led to legal action against car makers that had installed defeat devices to fool regulators  the government didnt deny the account a spokesperson said we are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our clean air strategy has been commended by the world health organization as an example for the rest of the world to follow  meanwhile on the covid19 crisis he said levels of the pollutant no2 had fallen by up to 60 in london since the fall in traffic under lockdown  levels of another pollutant sooty particles remained at harmful concentrations  a big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before once everybody goes back said prof corinne le quéré from the university of east anglia who led the analysis  the researchers say that fundamental systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change  when it comes to transportation there are huge opportunities according to prof le quéré  she says that after the global financial crisis in 2008 some governments like china us and germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables  image copyright getty images image caption airlines have been hit hard economically but the slowdown in flying hasnt hugely impacted emissions  here now in 2020 were very close to the same situation in electric mobility she told bbc news  battery prices have come down we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies  so if these two things can align then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow  grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change  a letter signed by 155 major companies representing 24 trillion £196 trillion in market capitalisation calls for a netzero emissions response to the covid crisis  corporations including carlsberg iberdrola edf

forward for transportation scientists believe  the authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action they point to the fact that while emissions of co2 may be

transport minister nitin gadkari said in a recent interview the northern state of uttar pradesh which has a population the size of brazil is already forming an economic task force to attract firms

easier said than done  many of these companies are facing severe cash and capital constraints because of the pandemic and will therefore be very cautious before making quick moves independent economist rupa subramanya said  according to rahul jacob a longtime china watcher and former financial times bureau chief in hong kong the indian government putting together land banks is a step in the right direction but large companies are unlikely to move their operations just because land is made available  production lines and supply chains are far more sticky than most people seem to understand it is very difficult to pull them apart overnight he said  china offers integrated infrastructure like large ports and highways top quality labour and sophisticated logistics all of which are critical factors to meet strict deadlines that international companies operate on  image copyright getty images image caption can india match chinas integrated infrastructure capabilities  another reason india might not be the obvious choice for global multinationals is because it isnt well integrated with major global supply chains  last year delhi pulled out of a crucial multilateral trade

global trade begins to follow the sell where you make model where companies socalled nearsource rather than outsource production and bring it closer to demand  indias volatile relationship with foreign direct investment fdi and uneven regulation is also something that continues to bother global companies  from prohibiting ecommerce companies to sell nonessential items and tweaking fdi rules

before the trade war began us goods imports from vietnam have soared by more than 50 and those from taiwan by 30 according to calculations made by the south china morning post newspaper  india is seen to have lost out because it failed to create conditions allowing multinationals to supply not only the local market but also to use the country as a production base to export to the world  in recent weeks several states have begun making moves to address some concerns around the ease of doing business  prime among them being making contentious changes to indias archaic labour laws put in place to reduce exploitation  uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh states for instance have suspended significant labour protections exempting factories from even maintaining basic requirements like cleanliness ventilation lighting and toilets  image copyright getty images image caption some indian states have stripped away laws that gave labourers basic protections  the intention is to improve the investment climate and attract global capital  but such decisions could become counterproductive and hurt rather than help says mr jacob international companies would be very wary about this they have strict codes of conduct on labour environment and safety standards for suppliers  the 2013 collapse of the rana plaza garment factory in bangladesh that supplied retailers like walmart was a turning point it forced bangladesh to significantly improve factory infrastructure and safety to clinch more investment he cautions  india has to follow better standards these are white board ideas drafted on

says  image copyright nvidia image caption ray tracing requires expensive processor chips  until now developers used another technique called rasterisation  it first appeared in the mid1990s is extremely quick and represents 3d shapes in triangles and polygons the one nearest the viewer determines the pixel  then programmers have to employ tricks to simulate what lighting looks like that includes lightmaps which calculate the brightness of surfaces ahead of time says mr ronald  but these hacks have limitations theyre static so fall apart when you move around for example you might zoom in on a mirror and find that your reflection has disappeared  more technology of business  programmable shaders started appearing around 2001 they did a much better job at 3d lighting tasks but required much more computational power  if we put all that into one game the most amazing processor in the world wouldve gone just no its too much says ben archard senior rendering programmer at maltabased 4a games developers behind a 2019 postapocalyptic game called metro exodus  there were ways around that if a programmer wanted to simulate the hazy light coming through fog instead of

to pass them on to customers  countries are being forced to use extreme measures to keep the economy afloat amid the coronavirus crisis  now the bank of england has signalled that it may take the cost of borrowing below zero  last month the bank started new work on how negative interest rates could affect banks and the wider economy  but what exactly are negative interest rates and could a world where savers are penalised and borrowers rewarded end up doing more harm than good  what are negative interest rates  the term interest rates is often used interchangeably with the bank of england base rate  described as the single most important interest rate in the uk the base rate determines how much interest the bank of england pays to financial institutions that hold money with it and what it charges them to borrow  high street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage  the bank of england usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less  it cut them to a fresh low of 01 in march to try to stimulate the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic  in theory taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect but in practice its a bit more complicated  after all why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money when they can keep the cash at home for free  why might this happen now  the bank of englands number one job is to keep prices across the economy rising steadily every year  this is known as the banks inflation target which is set at 2 by the government  inflation as measured by the consumer prices index cpi fell to 08 in april from 15 in march  while this means the pound in your pocket stretches further right now if inflation remains low for too long bosses start factoring that into pay reviews this can then dampen consumer confidence and spending  central banks have been cutting interest rates to spur inflation for years but as rates approached zero across the developed world a handful went a step further  sweden switzerland japan and the 19 nations of the eurozone all took interest rates below zero  in switzerland negative interest rates have also helped to discourage investors from pouring money into the country during times of uncertainty  how will this affect savers  british savers have already seen their returns dwindle in recent years  the average uk instant access account pays just 045 according to the bank of england while accounts that require you to lock your money away currently offer an average return of less than 1  in countries with subzero interest rates commercial banks have passed them on to big companies  however the evidence suggests there is a much higher bar to pass the pain on to ordinary savers  christina nyman chief economist at swedish lender handelsbanken says charging savers to put money in their own accounts is seen as taboo in sweden  she says competition is fierce and households are ready to move their money to another bank so nobody wants to lose business  swiss banks ubs and credit suisse only impose negative rates on deposits of more than 2 million swiss francs  in germany where some banks impose charges on deposits of more than €100000 £90000 some people have started stashing their money in vaults  image copyright getty images image caption german demand for bank vaults has risen since the european central bank introduced negative interest rates  according to germanys central bank physical cash holdings by families and businesses there have almost trebled to €434bn since the european central bank ecb introduced a negative deposit rate in 2014  but david oxley at capital economics says there hasnt been a wider shift towards cash because most people still prefer the security and convenience of keeping it in the bank  putting it in a vault runs the risk of the money either being lost stolen or damaged he says bank deposits cannot catch fire but banknotes can  what about borrowers  negative rate mortgages already exist last year danish bank jyske announced that it would effectively pay borrowers 05 a year to take out a 10year loan  james pomeroy an economist at hsbc says this was only possible because of the nature of the mortgage market  when someone in denmark applies for a home loan danish banks act as a middleman between potential borrowers and investors  in denmark the banks dont take the hit investors do says mr pomeroy banks are then charging higher product fees so have actually made money off of this  but negative rate mortgages are unlikely to be offered in the uk any time soon  when uk interest rates were slashed to 05 in march 2009 some borrowers thought they could be in line for a payment  around 1500 cheltenham and gloucester customers had a mortgage that tracked 101 percentage points below the bank of england base rate  but any prospect of a windfall was quickly dashed when financial regulators described interest payments as a oneway obligation on the borrower  image copyright matt cardy image caption around 1500 cheltenham  gloucester borrowers did not benefit from negative interest rates when the bank of england slashed rates to 05 in 2009  what are the side effects of negative interest rates  negative interest rates hit bank earnings by squeezing the gap between the money they make on loans and what they pay to savers  if not passed on to customers negative rates would hurt bank profitability especially at a time when they are expected to be hit by crisisrelated loan losses says danae kyriakopoulou chief economist at the official monetary and financial institutions forum omfif  negative interest rates pose a particular challenge to building societies which hold around £1 of every £5 in british savings accounts  while commercial banks can access cheaper borrowing by tapping financial markets building societies must raise at least half their funding from individual savers  image copyright nationwide image caption building societies like the nationwide look after £1 in every £5 of british savings  the bank of england is in the process of assessing the impact of negative rates on uk bank and building society profits as well as how they affect insurers and pension funds  it is examining whether changing a scheme that rewards small business lending with access to cheap money or shielding a share of the money high street lenders park at the central bank from negative rates can help to offset the hit to profits  ms kyriakopoulou says more work needs to be done before negative rates can be deployed in the uk  one advantage in the uk compared to say the euro area is that weve seen strong coordination between the treasury and the independent bank of england in terms of their crisis response measures she adds  provided negative rates were also accompanied by continued support to the banking sector this would help cushion the negative impact of the policy on the banking sector']\n",

incredible suffering for people and families for whom that 600 was making it so they could survive in these extremely difficult times and now have it yanked out from under them” shierholz said “there

that cummings travelled from his parents’ farm to barnard castle at a time when nonessential journeys were banned insisting only that he had selfisolated for 14 days  a second passerby came forward to claim that they saw cummings in bluebell woods on 19 april five days after downing street says he returned to london and remained in the capital  nine tory mps publicly called on him to go while three members of a government scientific advisory committee criticised ministers for “trashing” their advice eroding trust and reducing compliance with lockdown  after spending several hours with cummings in downing street on sunday the prime minister told the briefing that his aide had travelled to “try to find the right kind of childcare” and claimed he wanted to reduce the spread of the virus  “i have had extensive facetoface conversations with dominic cummings and i have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus  and when he had no alternative  i think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent” johnson said  describing some of the allegations against cummings as “palpably false” – but not saying which – the prime minister continued “i believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly legally and with integrity and with the overriding aim to stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives”  three members of spib the sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists to government on how the public might respond to lockdown measures reacted with disdain to johnson’s defence of cummings  prof stephen reicher of st andrews university tweeted “i can say that in a few short minutes tonight boris johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control covid19  “be open and honest we said trashed respect the public we said trashed ensure equity so everyone is treated the same we said trashed be consistent we said trashed make clear ‘we are all in it together’ trashed  “it is very hard to provide scientific advice to a government which doesn’t want to listen to science i hope however that the public will read our papers … and continue to make up for this bad government with their own good sense”  he was backed by prof susan michie and prof robert

available at httpstcotfk4vyblil and continue to make up for this bad government with their own good sense  the labour leader keir starmer said johnson’s decision to take no action against cummings was “an insult to sacrifices made by the british people”  the scottish first minister nicola sturgeon who accepted the resignation of the country’s chief medical officer catherine calderwood after she visited a second home during lockdown said johnson should follow this example  “i know it is tough to lose a trusted adviser at the height of crisis but when it’s a choice of that or integrity of vital public health advice the latter must come first” she said  “that’s the judgment i and to her credit catherine calderwood reached pm and cummings should do likewise”  johnson’s unexpected appearance at the press briefing on sunday – his first in nearly two weeks  was seen by his own mps as an attempt to protect cummings following revelations that the adviser had broken the lockdown rules he had helped to write  johnson did not respond to a series of detailed questions including whether cummings stopped during the fourhour journey and whether the prime minister had known of cummings’s trip at the time  senior tory mps said that the prime minister’s decision to attend the press conference and his inability to answer detailed questions will fuel the furore and will damage his premiership “the pm is losing his instinct he might be losing the plot and we could lose the country over this virus” said one  reacting to the prime minister’s comments sir roger gale mp said it was an “extraordinary position” for johnson to take “it’s up to the prime minister to exercise judgment about who he has around him” he told bbc radio 5 live  tim montgomerie a former johnson adviser tweeted “tonight i’m really embarrassed to have ever backed boris johnson for high office”  play video 123 boris johnson dominic cummings followed instincts of every father in lockdown – video  mps including the former minister and 1922 committee member steve baker and the chair of the northern ireland select committee simon hoare said cummings should step aside to stop further damage to the government  hoare said “with the damage mr cummings is doing to the government’s reputation he must consider his position lockdown has had its challenges for everyone  “it’s his cavalier ‘i don’t care i’m cleverer than you’ tone that infuriates people he is now wounding the pmgovt  i don’t like that”  anger and dismay was also expressed by church of england bishops on twitter after the prime minister’s press conference the rt revd nick baines bishop of leeds said “the question now is do we accept being lied to patronised and treated by a pm as mugs the moral question is not for cummings  it is for pm and ministersmps who find this behaviour acceptable  “what are we to teach our children i ask as a responsible father”  a few minutes earlier the rt revd dr helenann hartley bishop of ripon wrote “integrity trust and leadership were never there just a driven misguided ideology of power that has total disregard for the most weak and vulnerable and those who work to protect and care for us with relatively low pay”  following the press conference starmer said “this was a test of the prime minister and he has failed it it is an insult to sacrifices made by the british people that boris johnson has chosen to take no action against dominic cummings the public will be forgiven for thinking there is one rule for the prime minister’s closest adviser and another for the british people  “the prime minister’s actions have undermined confidence in his own public health message at this crucial time millions were watching for answers and they got nothing that’s why the cabinet secretary must now launch an urgent inquiry”  leaving downing street after about six hours in no 10 on sunday cummings refused to answer questions earlier police officers had visited his north london home in response to media gathering outside  a jogger reported that he saw cummings on 19 april five days after downing street says he returned to london from durham and did not return  ministers had denied reports in the guardian and daily mirror that cummings was seen looking at bluebells in woods near houghall close to his family’s property on the outskirts of durham that day  our source stood by their claim and tim matthews a runner has since come forward to claim he saw cummings later that day matthews tweeted a link to a route from the running app strava that he had dubbed “brick run aka

racing to attend to vital matters of state in retrospect many will ask whether he was just trying to beat the traffic  over the last 72 hours downing street officials unnamed sources and ministers have attempted to cast doubt on parts of the timeline of cummings’s travels  but an examination of the public record placed alongside the guardian and daily mirror’s reporting means that it is possible to lay out the significant claims and counterclaims of the period in question – and where questions still remain  friday 27 march downing street  on the day cummings ran out of no 10 his wife mary wakefield appears to have been already ill according to her spectator article about the experience in which she says “my husband did rush home to look after me” the article did not mention that soon after he rushed home the family went to the other end of the country  the government has briefed that cummings travelled north before developing symptoms of the virus which is said to have struck him over the weekend of 2829 march  wakefield wrote that cummings said “i feel weird” and collapsed 24 hours after he came home to look after her placing their journey north on friday – perhaps trying to beat the weekend getaway – or saturday at the latest  the details of the journey from london remain unclear  did he drive or take the train on sunday the cabinet minister grant shapps didn’t know he was asked whether cummings had stopped for a break at any point on the fourhour journey accompanied by a small child and a sick wife  despite being given notice of the question by sky’s sophy ridge the evening before and having been in contact with cummings shapps was caught flatfooted “i’m afraid i don’t have detail to the point of what time of day and how many stops” he said adding that he was “expert” in transport matters and would prefer to talk about the a66  in its defence of cummings no 10 said the couple had had to travel north in search of childcare from cummings’s sister and nieces at the property owned by his parents  the former downing street director of communications alastair campbell among others described this as guff he said it was unbelievable that cummings had to travel 264 miles to get help with childcare  but in the end cummings and his wife did not need childcare no 10 have said instead relying on the family to deliver food to their door  tuesday 31 march durham  the police have said that on 31 march they were “made aware of reports” of cummings’s presence in the area  on friday durham constabulary told the guardian and daily mirror that they had then contacted the family to “reiterate the appropriate advice around essential travel”  the statement confirmed – for the first time – that cummings had left london for the northeast  but on saturday downing street insisted the police were wrong no 10 said that “at no stage was cummings or his family spoken to by the police about this matter”  this version is now under intense scrutiny under pressure to explain the differing accounts police issued a new statement on saturday and stood by by the original claim  not just that it seems the police might have been alerted to cummings’s presence in durham by – his father and that it was during this conversation that police had “reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel”  by sunday morning shapps was disputing a subtly different point he told the bbc’s andrew marr “for one thing the father contacted the police not the other way round” and claiming that security was the “key thing” in the conversation  sunday 5 april the ‘abba’ sighting  the following days by wakefield’s account were a mixture of family idyll and health nightmare as she made a “palace out of polystyrene packaging” with their son even as cummings’s breathing got so bad that she feared he should be in hospital  but 10 days after her husband first fell ill she said he began to feel better – just as boris johnson went into hospital that would place the improvement in his condition around sunday 5 april although 10 days after the 28th – the earliest point at which cummings was said to have been symptomatic – was 7 april  that sunday a passerby told the guardian they spotted cummings by sheer chance the encounter was fleeting but memorable cummings was standing outside with his little boy in “dark coat and thick tartan scarf” and abba was playing at full blast  on the same day the guardian asked downing street about the claims “it’ll be a ‘no comment’ on that one” an official responded on the friday of the same week after establishing further details the guardian asked again again the response was no comment  sunday 12 april barnard castle  wakefield did not mention that on 12 april – her birthday according to companies house records – they allegedly made a trip to barnard castle a charming town 30 miles from the cummings’s family property described on the english heritage website as having “fantastic views” and “plenty to do for families on a day out”  that detail emerged in an interview with robin lees a retired chemistry teacher who lives in the town  lees who says he has a photographic memory told the guardian he was “a bit gobsmacked” to see cummings and then was so incensed that he made a note of the family car’s numberplate and checked it online when he got home  while government officials spent weeks refusing to talk about cummings’s whereabouts and have since saturday sought to dismiss the joint investigation as “fake news” and “a stream of false allegations … from campaigning newspapers” they have not disputed lees’s account  his account is awkward for no 10  on saturday shapps – like other conservatives who defended the prime minister’s most senior aide – repeatedly emphasised that after the cummings family had made their journey across the country they had “stayed put”  not according to lees they hadn’t on sunday shapps appeared to change tack  he seemed to say that this trip would have come at the end of the quarantine period  no mention however of the fact this trip would seem to be a clear breach of the strict lockdown rules in place at the time  would a journey to a popular daytrip destination on a loved one’s birthday 30 miles from the lockdown location constitute essential travel or compliance with the government’s “stay home” instruction  that easter weekend a new government campaign reminded people that even at a time when people might wish to spend time together the rules still applied “the new campaign reinforces the importance of staying at home over easter” it said reiterating the importance of “only leaving your house to buy essentials to do one form of exercise a day to travel into work but only where you cannot work from home and for any medical or social care need”  tuesday 14 april london  the 14day period of cummings’s isolation would have expired on 10 april assuming it is counted from when wakefield appears to have first fallen ill on 27 march   in a piece for the spectator the magazine she works for wakefield wrote “we emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of london lockdown” no clarification however that they had actually emerged into the capital from durham  the guardian asked wakefield to confirm whether the family had been in london throughout the lockdown period but received no reply  cummings was photographed back in downing street on 14 april clutching a bag containing a carton of soup a tangerine and a carrot  sunday 19 april ‘bluebell’ woods  could cummings have then gone back to the northeast from london downing street is emphatic that he did not  the denial came after another witness claimed to the guardian and sunday mirror that they had seen cummings and wakefield on a country walk in houghall woods a beauty spot near his parents’ property in durham  according to this account cummings said “aren’t the bluebells lovely”  while downing street would give no ontherecord comment before publication of the new stories on saturday it then issued a statement  it accused the guardian and the mirror of writing “inaccurate stories … including claims that mr cummings returned to durham after returning to work in downing street on 14 april we will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about mr cummings from campaigning newspapers”  in interviews on

second time  that remains unclear a key question is whether antibodies produced by the body following an infection with the coronavirus provide some level of immunity and if so for how long  but we do have some clues “we know from ‘normal’ coronavirus studies done in the past you can infect people after about a year following an initial infection” said dr ben killingley consultant in acute medicine and infectious diseases at university college london hospital  dr joshua schiffer an expert in infectious diseases at fred hutchinson cancer research center in the us added that any signs of reinfection would require detailed scrutiny  “i have yet to see a definitive case of reinfection reported in the scientific literature to date to truly prove reinfection and discriminate from prolonged viral shedding related to the first infection would require sequencing of both the first and second viruses and demonstration that the two viruses are genetically different” he said adding it will also be important to look at symptoms and how long reinfection lasts  “it is also important to recognise that documentation of one or a handful of reinfections does not prove that this is a common epidemiologically important event”  what happened in south korea where patients tested positive after having recovered from covid19  this initially caused concerns as experts feared the results might suggest patients had been reinfected however the world health organization has since said the results were actually false positives a result of the test picking up particles of the virus within dead lung cells – but this is not active virus that’s because the pcr or “haveyougotit” test is based on detecting genetic material from the virus – on its own it does not reveal whether that virus is active and infectious or not  why do some people have longlasting symptoms  some people with covid19 experience complications following an initial infection  “in some persons they begin to feel well again and signs and symptoms including fever decrease but some then go on to develop respiratory distress and must be provided oxygen in hospital” said david heymann professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine “it appears to be a delayed immune response that is more serious in some persons and that reacts to remaining virus in various organs”  even some people who have had a mild experience of covid19 have reported experiencing symptoms for several weeks or even months although experts say only time and testing will tell what the longterm implications are and how common this is  lingering and painful the long and unclear road to coronavirus recovery read more  killingley said it was unclear what was behind such ongoing symptoms but there are a range of possibilities – including inflammation caused by the virus – although the mechanisms and risks are as yet unclear  immunology professor daniel altmann of imperial college london said such cases are important to study  “we are at the beginning of describing what may be a complex picture of chronic disease that may ensue from the initial infection – coming and going in relapsing waves sometimes almost like a kind of chronic fatigue syndrome” he said “these cases may reflect examples of virus not fully cleared or alternatively some kind of damaging posthoc disturbance to immune or inflammatory function” he said  schiffer agreed such cases are cause for concern “in the case of sars cov2 my colleagues and i are particularly worried about the possibility of prolonged periods of lung inflammation andor scarring” he said  could the coronavirus lie dormant in the body and then reactivate  experts say it is unlikely “i know some have discussed ‘reactivation’ of virus but this seems unhelpful and unsupported to me” said altmann “it’s a term that’s borrowed from other viruses especially the herpes virus family that can hide in the body in a latent state to reactivate years later there is no evidence of that at all for coronaviruses”  how long are people with covid19 infectious for  a recent study of 60 coronavirus patients in china showed 10 patients tested positive for covid19 after discharge from hospital however once again experts say this could be down to the test picking up genetic material from inactive virus with other studies including work in south korea suggesting those who test positive with covid19 after recovering from the disease are not infectious  “it’s not uncommon to find virus in the nose or throat for up to four weeks after initial infection but tests to establish whether this is live infectious virus – as opposed to just genetic material detection – are not normally positive for much longer than a week” said killingley adding “i haven’t come across relapse cases whereby the initial infection acquired weeks ago reignites itself into an infectious case”  schiffer had doubts “in my view the presence of sars cov2 rna many weeks after initial infection may represent ongoing viral replication in cells which also implies the persistence of small amounts of “active” virus” he said “however quantities are tiny and may represent the dying embers of infection in the body”  altmann said that asymptomatic cases aside infectiousness correlates strongly with acute symptoms which typically last for up to 12 days with a tailout to 28 days “my sense is that in the people who are feeling unwell long after this it may not be virus but some kind of immune or inflammatory perturbation” he

            "['303', 'will covid19 mutate into a more dangerous virus', 'as the coronavirus spreads around the world there are concerns that it will mutate into a form that is more transmissible more dangerous or both potentially making the global health crisis even worse what do we know about the way the virus is evolving  is the virus mutating  all viruses mutate and the sarscov2 coronavirus that causes covid19 is no exception mutations arise when the virus replicates inside cells and mistakes are made in copying its genetic code unlike humans whose genes are written in doublestranded dna the coronavirus genes are carried on singlestranded rna  how fast is the virus mutating  the coronavirus is actually quite stable scientists have analysed about 13000 samples in britain since midmarch and found that new mutations appear roughly twice a month the rate of mutations is important because the faster a virus mutates the quicker it changes behaviour a fastevolving virus can be harder to make a vaccine against because by the time it has been developed the parts of the virus the immune system attacks might have changed seasonal influenza mutates so rapidly we need a different vaccine each year  how does coronavirus vary around the world  the genetic code from coronaviruses around the globe show that it splits into groups as it spreads there is nothing unusual about this researchers in germany identified three main genetic groups of the virus in april which they named a b and c groups a and c are mostly found in europeans and americans while group b is most common in east asia but there are smaller groups too which scientists can use to trace infections back to their sources and ultimately back to a region such as wuhan or northern italy  why do mutations matter  mutations happen by chance all the time most have little effect and some hamper the virus but over time single or multiple mutations can potentially build up that make the virus more successful by enabling it to spread more easily mutations can also make the virus more dangerous for example by making it more efficient at infecting cells  what mutations has the virus picked up  a number of mutations have caught scientists’ attention researchers at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine studied more than 5000 coronavirus genomes from around the world and discovered several mutations that may be evidence of the virus adapting to humans two mutations are in the critical “spike” protein that the virus uses to invade cells  the spike mutations are rare at the moment but martin hibberd a professor of emerging infectious diseases and a senior author on the study which has yet to be peerreviewed said their emergence highlighted the need for global surveillance of the virus that will reveal whether the new mutations help it to spread and whether vaccines may need to be redesigned  in another preliminary study scientists at sheffield university and los alamos national laboratory in new mexico found similar mutations in the spike protein which the authors claim may help the infection to spread while that is possible other scientists believe it is too early to know whether any of the mutations are helping the virus thrive  prof nick loman at the university of birmingham said that all coronaviruses are very similar and that viruses with particular mutations can rise up in different areas for a range of reasons a major factor is which virus gains a foothold first the socalled founder effect which may come down to one person’s travel plans rather than any adaptation of the virus “from the point of view of people who are understandably concerned about this pandemic i’m sure it will not matter which mutations the virus has it’s not a good virus either way” he said “we look to see if any of the mutations change behaviour and we don’t have any evidence for that”  but there is some reason for hope another preliminary study this time by researchers in the uk and us revealed that after looking at more than 15000 coronavirus genomes from patients around the world scientists found no sign the virus is becoming more transmissible – in other words it is not becoming easier to pass from person to person  the team found 6822 mutations in total relative to the ancestral genome however none of the genomes showed more than 29 single position changes known as snps the researchers then focused on 31 mutations that appear to have arisen independently at least 10 times  “if there is a mutation that appears and makes it transmit better then we should see it happening multiple times” said prof francois balloux a coauthor of the research at university college london however the team found these mutations either had a neutral impact on the virus or were actually detrimental to it  what else can mutations tell us  as scientists learn more about the genetic makeup of coronaviruses they will be able to use the information to trace an individual’s infection to nearby clusters and ultimately back to its origin that can be useful for tracing outbreaks and spotting newly imported infections but intense monitoring will also flag up how the virus mutates and acquires resistance to and drugs and vaccines that are used in the future “as those become available we would expect to see functional mutations just like with see with antibiotic resistance in bacteria” loman said']\n",
            "['304', 'why we might not get a coronavirus vaccine', 'politicians have become more cautious about immunisation prospects they are right to be  it would be hard to overstate the importance of developing a vaccine to sarscov2 – it’s seen as the fast track to a return to normal life that’s why the health secretary matt hancock said the uk was “throwing everything at it”  but while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed – oxford university is now recruiting 10000 volunteers for the next phase of its research – ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days  this is why  why might a vaccine fail  earlier this week england’s deputy chief medical officer jonathan vantam said the words nobody wanted to hear “we can’t be sure we will get a vaccine”  but he was right to be circumspect  vaccines are simple in principle but complex in practice the ideal vaccine protects against infection prevents its spread and does so safely but none of this is easily achieved as vaccine timelines show  more than 30 years after scientists isolated hiv the virus that causes aids we have no vaccine the dengue fever virus was identified in 1943 but the first vaccine was approved only last year and even then amid concerns it made the infection worse in some people the fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps it took four years  scientists have worked on coronavirus vaccines before so are not starting from scratch two coronaviruses have caused lethal outbreaks before namely sars and mers and vaccine research went ahead for both but none have been licensed partly because sars fizzled out and mers is regional to the middle east the lessons learned will help scientists create a vaccine for sarscov2 but there is still an awful lot to learn about the virus  a chief concern is that coronaviruses do not tend to trigger longlasting immunity about a quarter of common colds are caused by human coronaviruses but the immune response fades so rapidly that people can become reinfected the next year  researchers at oxford university recently analysed blood from recovered covid19 patients and found that levels of igg antibodies – those responsible for longerlasting immunity – rose steeply in the first month of infection but then began to fall again  last week scientists at rockefeller university in new york found that most people who recovered from covid19 without going into hospital did not make many killer antibodies against the virus  “that’s what is particularly challenging” says stanley perlman a veteran coronavirus researcher at the university of iowa “if the natural infection doesn’t give you that much immunity except when it’s a severe infection what will a vaccine do it could be better but we don’t know” if a vaccine only protects for a year the virus will be with us for some time  the genetic stability of the virus matters too some viruses such as influenza mutate so rapidly that vaccine developers have to release new formulations each year the rapid evolution of hiv is a major reason we have no vaccine for the disease  so far the sarscov2 coronavirus seems fairly stable but it is acquiring mutations as all viruses do some genetic changes have been spotted in the virus’s protein “spikes” which are the basis of most vaccines if the spike protein mutates too much the antibodies produced by a vaccine will effectively be out of date and might not bind the virus effectively enough to prevent infection  martin hibberd professor of emerging infectious diseases at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine who helped identify some of the virus’s mutations called them “an early warning”  another challenge making any vaccine safe  in the rush to develop a vaccine – there are now more than 100 in development – safety must remain a priority unlike experimental drugs for the severely ill the vaccine will be given to potentially billions of generally healthy people  this means scientists will have to check extremely carefully for signs of dangerous sideeffects during the search for a sars vaccine in 2004 scientists found that one candidate caused hepatitis in ferrets another serious concern is “antibodyinduced enhancement” where the antibodies produced by a vaccine actually make future infections worse the effect caused serious lung damage in animals given experimental vaccines for both sars and mers  john mccauley director of the worldwide influenza centre at the francis crick institute says it takes time to understand the particular challenges each vaccine throws up “you don’t know the difficulties the specific difficulties that every vaccine will give you” he says “and we haven’t got experience in handling this virus or the components of the virus”  we should ‘end up with something’ … but what does that mean  when the prime minister boris johnson told a no 10 press briefing that a vaccine was “by no means guaranteed” his chief scientific adviser patrick vallance agreed but added “i’d be surprised if we didn’t end up with something” many scientists share that view  in all likelihood a coronavirus vaccine will not be 100 effective  those in development draw on at least eight different approaches from weakened and inactivated viruses to technologies that smuggle genetic code into the recipient’s cells which then churn out spike proteins for the immune system to make antibodies against  ideally a vaccine will generate persistent high levels of antibodies to wipe out the virus and also “t” cells to destroy infected cells but each vaccine is different and today no one knows what kind of immune response is good enough  “we don’t even know if a vaccine can produce an immune response which would protect against future infection” says david heymann who led the response of the world health organization who to the sars epidemic  early results from two frontrunner vaccines suggest they might have some use  the us biotech firm moderna reported antibody levels similar to those found in recovered patients in 25 people who received its vaccine  another vaccine from oxford university did not stop monkeys contracting the virus but did appear to prevent pneumonia a major cause of death in coronavirus patients  if humans react the same way vaccinated people would still spread the virus but be less likely to die from it  how well a vaccine works determines how it is used armed with a highly effective vaccine that protects for several years countries could aim for herd immunity by protecting at least twothirds of the population  coronavirus patients pass the virus on to three others on average but if two or more are immune the outbreak will fizzle out that is the bestcase scenario  more likely is we will end up with a vaccine or a number of vaccines that are only partially effective  vaccines that contain weakened strains of virus can be dangerous for older people but might be given to younger people with more robust immune systems to reduce the spread of infection  meanwhile older people might get vaccines that simple prevent infections progressing to lifethreatening pneumonia “if you don’t have the ability to induce immunity you’ve got to develop a strategy for reducing serious outcomes of infection” says mccauley  but partially effective vaccines have their own problems a vaccine that doesn’t stop the virus replicating can encourage resistant strains to evolve making the vaccine redundant  so is the virus here to stay  the simple answer is yes  hopes for eliminating the virus start with a vaccine but do not end there “if and when we have a vaccine what you get is not rainbows and unicorns” says larry brilliant ceo of pandefense advisory who led the who’s smallpox eradication programme “if we are forced to choose a vaccine that gives only one year of protection then we are doomed to have covid become endemic an infection that is always with us”  the virus will still be tough to conquer with a vaccine that lasts for years  “it will be harder to get rid of covid than smallpox” says brilliant with smallpox it was at least clear who was infected whereas people with coronavirus can spread it without knowing a thornier problem is that as long as the infection rages in one country all other nations are at risk  as david salisbury the former director of immunisation at the department of health told a chatham house webinar recently “unless we have a vaccine available in unbelievable quantities that could be administered extraordinarily quickly in all communities in the world we will have gaps in our defences that the virus can continue to circulate in”  or as brilliant puts it the virus will “pingpong back and forth in time and geography”  one proposal from gavi the vaccine alliance is to boost the availability of vaccines around the world through an “advance market commitment” and brilliant believes some kind of global agreement must be hammered out now “we should be demanding now a global conference on what we’re going to do when we get a vaccine or if we don’t” he says  “if the process of getting a vaccine testing it proving it manufacturing it planning for its delivery and building a vaccine programme all over the world if that’s going to take as long as we think then let’s fucking start planning it now”  how will we live with the virus  people will have to adapt – and life will change heymann says we will have to get used to extensive monitoring for infections backed up by swift outbreak containment people must play their part too by maintaining handwashing physical distancing and avoiding gatherings particularly in enclosed spaces repurposed drugs are faster to test than vaccines so we may have an antiviral or an antibody treatment that works before a vaccine is available he adds immediate treatment when symptoms come on could at least reduce the death rate  yuen kwokyung a professor of infectious disease at the university of hong kong has advised his government that all social distancing can be relaxed – but only if people wear masks in enclosed spaces such as on trains and at work and that no food or drink are consumed at concerts and cinemas  at restaurants tables will have to be shielded from each other and serving staff will follow strict rules to prevent spreading the virus “in our hong kong perspective the diligent and correct use of reusable masks is the most important measure” he says  sarita jane robinson a psychologist who studies responses to threats at the university of central lancashire says people are still adapting to the “new normal” and that without more interventions – such as fines for not wearing face masks – “we could see people drifting back to old behaviours”  we might become blase about covid19 deaths when life resumes and the media move on but the seriousness of the illness will make it harder to ignore she says  has the coronavirus pandemic made us all nicer read more  one last possibility could save a lot of trouble some scientists wonder whether the common cold coronaviruses crossed into humans in the distant past and caused similar illness before settling down “if the virus doesn’t change there’s no reason to think that miraculously in five years’ time it won’t still cause pneumonia” says perlman “but that’s the hope that we end up with a much more mild disease and you only get a bad cold from it”  heymann says it is too soon to know how the pandemic will pan out “we don’t understand the destiny of this virus” he says “will it continue to circulate after its first pandemic or will it like some other pandemic viruses disappear or become less virulent that we do not know”']\n",

city  the coronavirus lockdown has quietened canada’s largest city but there has been little reprieve for an industry rife with violence and intimidation – and some towtruck owners fear that organized crime has pushed the industry to a breaking point  two boys aged 15 and 17 were charged on thursday with firstdegree and attempted murder and toronto police told the guardian they do not believe kinani’s murder was related to an ongoing turf war  but he was the fourth toronto towtruck driver to be murdered in less than two years several others have been shot – or shot at – including one who was targeted just hours after kinani’s death  in a statement to the guardian following kinani’s murder ontario’s ministry of transportation said it was “deeply concerned” by the violence in the towing industry and was working to “deter this behaviour”  a recent investigation by the globe and mail found at least 30 arson attacks targeting towtruck businesses though that figure has now risen since

catch you” ford warned the attackers “the party’s over”  for many drivers the violence feels unrelenting  “i worry about waking up to find my truck on fire outside of my house” one driver who has worked in the industry for 13 years told the guardian  much of trouble stems from “accident chasing” – where truck operators race their rivals to be the first at the scene of a crash  some repair garages will pay tow truck drivers a “finder’s fee” for damaged vehicles making “chasing” an incredibly lucrative field  facebook twitter pinterest hashim kinani the tow truck driver who was recently

kraken charging more than 70 people – including seven drivers – with offenses ranging from firearms possession to conspiracy to commit murder  police recovered tasers and body armour and found that numerous drivers were armed and “prepared to shoot other towtruck operators over an ongoing battle over territory” said toronto’s police deputy chief james ramer  but nearly a year after those highprofile raids critics say the problems have only got worse  “we’ve got guys racing down the highway to be the first to arrive for a tow threaten each other bang into each other and even shoot each other things need to change” said john henderson of the fair towing task force a lobby group advocating for industry reform  henderson and others have called for greater regulation and licensing as well as the establishment of an oversight body to rein in what they say is an increasingly saturated industry with few clear standards  “trucks are just popping up every few days with new names and faces and then they disappear just as fast their one motive is to eliminate competition and own the road it’s crazy these days” said the driver  in theory the towing industry is regulated at a municipal level in ontario but according to the canadian automobile association only 17 of ontario’s 444 municipalities have clear rules meaning swaths of the province have become a freeforall for drivers looking to circumvent or exploit exiting loopholes  companies say they also want clear regulations for truck maintenance and safety – as well as better training standards for drivers  henderson says a number of “unscrupulous” drivers are using modified trucks – not actual tow trucks “if an unlicensed unregulated guy picks up your vehicle he’s never going to see you again he’s going to charge you as much as he thinks you’re going to pay”  with the government preoccupied by the coronavirus pandemic businesses worry that legislation that has been repeatedly proposed will once again be forgotten  but henderson hopes the recent shooting will put lingering crisis back in the spotlight  “because let’s be clear someone was killed” he said “we need to fix this”']\n",

crusher and i can’t think of anybody except donald j trump that could have pulled it off with such effectiveness such absolutism and shall i say aplomb”  up popped another banner that said “get your official i heart trump wine glasses”  ‘extreme loyalty’  democrats such as vela the former biden adviser find the trump children and their partners as offensive as the president himself  “you’ve got to sell your soul if you’re gonna be a part of it” he said “it’s almost like a mafioso operation the mafia of hate there is so much hate and hatred filled in their bones and in their hearts i’ve never seen anything like it in my life”  but for the president the children form a protective shield  joshua kendall author of first dads parenting and politics from george washington to barack obama said “the family is really important to trump because he can get from them what he can’t get from most of the people who sign up to work with him extreme loyalty so he’s definitely going to lean on them and i think we’re witnessing a family tragedy because the children are all competing for who can be the most protective of daddy  “it’s very disturbing the extent to which they’re willing to go and i guess the most chilling example was where eric said that after the election we’ll find out that the whole covid pandemic was cooked up by the democrats that’s the extent to which they’re willing to bend reality to stand up for their father it’s also the tragedy of the republican party that a lot of politicians are in this same position where in order to stay aligned with trump they have to bend reality”  i think stark political reality will hit them all whether donald trump wins reelection or not michael steele  presidential candidates’ children usually work behind the scenes kendall noted pointing to the sons of jimmy carter in the 1970s and george w bush in his father’s campaigns in 1988 and 1992  “but what’s interesting about the trump kids is they’re publicly playing the role of the hatchet man which is usually played by the vicepresident famously spiro agnew under richard nixon and that’s not something we’ve seen before”  the dynasty may yet continue signs such as “don jr 2024” and “ivanka 2032” have been spotted at trump rallies a surveymonkey poll for axios in january asked who republicans would consider voting for in 2024 it was led by the vicepresident mike pence but don jr was second nikki haley third and ivanka fourth  michael steele former chairman of the republican national committee said “there’s a lot of talk about that but i think the stark political reality that will hit them all whether donald trump wins reelection or not is that there are a whole lot of republicans waiting in the wings for this administration’s transition to lame duck and they are not going to go quietly into that good night  “it will not be ‘oh you’re donald trump’s son or daughter so we bow and get out of the way’ that ain’t happening”']\n",

heart of trumpian populism  on the one hand it is rooted in the belief that the silent majority should come first not the elites on the other its operative dictum is “we should not choose our leaders

            "['317', 'help i think im falling in love over zoom', 'i vowed to spend the coronavirus quarantine focused on looking inward then i went on one virtual date and everything changed  lying comfortably on her back allie looks up into my eyes and graces me with another one of the big smiles that i’ve quickly grown to cherish since matching with her on the dating app hinge last week it’s our third date the first two went exceedingly well with seamless conversation uncovering likeminded worldviews agreeable senses of humor and even some respective vulnerabilities by this point as the thirddate rule dictates getting a little randy was natural  “i was wondering how long it was going to take me to get you into bed” i say sparking a laugh considering our current circumstances  indeed this is the first time i’ve been welcomed into allie’s bedroom but this experience has only been made possible thanks to the magic of contemporary videocommunication technology  such is courtship in the coronavirus quarantine of 2020  “you look so good” i say into my phone also in bed at my apartment in queens allie whose name has been altered here out of respect for her privacy thanks me miles away from brooklyn earlier this evening in an attempt at normalcy we each dined on homecooked meals – chicken rice and steamed broccoli in my case pasta with beyond burger chunks in hers – while videochatting on zoom dressing up as though we were meeting each other at a restaurant – i wore a blazer shirt and tie while she donned a creamsicleinspired spring dress and dangling earrings  now over facetime the conversation turns to sex and our possible compatibility in that arena about five minutes in it becomes apparent we are in fact very compatible in that arena  we disclose some sexual predilections that like our political perspectives are in lockstep  it somehow feels as though heat is being exchanged between our screens almost no different than if we were lying next to each other when i ask allie to unbutton the top of her dress – a wish she grants – it happens with effortless spontaneity like all of our other interactions driven by the evidence that allie’s obviously into me and the fact that we’re only on video chat an unusual amount of selfconfidence flows through me i can almost play out the prospective intimate next steps in my mind from muscle memory the only hindrance being the smartphone in my hand  i begin to tell her “i’m so turned on right now”  photograph ellen surreynarratively  but she doesn’t hear the whole sentence my screen goes black  fuck i realize i’ve made the rookie mistake of not charging my phone during a third virtual date – perhaps the equivalent of forgetting to bring a condom to one “in real life”  by the time my battery recovers the mood is shot but for the most part i don’t mind i probably shouldn’t have ventured into that territory to begin with  i had made a promise to myself that during quarantine i’d do a better job of working on myself of sitting with my feelings no matter how sad or worrisome they might become across nearly six years of talk therapy – to treat an anxiety disorder and depression – i’ve learned that mentally remaining in the present moment or practicing mindfulness helps reduce my stress levels but i’ve also learned just how difficult such an exercise is for me one of the ways i’ve taken myself out of the moment in the past is through dating and trying to locate selfworth through the eyes of a woman who’s into me regardless of my true feelings for her staying present during the pandemic would be a great test and one i believed i could gain much from if i set my mind to it so in some ways i was looking forward to alone time  then i started falling for allie a woman i have now been dating for a month but still have not met in person  •••  as the pandemic caught fire in china over the winter i began breaking bad cycles of behavior i stopped drinking redoubled my efforts in therapy worked out at a gym six days a week improved my diet and pulled back on dating to work on myself before opening up to another person it was part of a larger plan i have a history of selfsoothing my anxiety with booze food and sometimes women emotional chaos is my baseline norm so i tend to make rash decisions without considering the later consequences to my state of mind it’s getting drunk to reduce stress but instead guaranteeing a hangover when i’d planned on a productive work day which in turn increases stress it’s eating unhealthy comfort foods and then feeling anger at my body when i look in the mirror it’s climbing into bed with a near stranger feeling vulnerable with them and then experiencing inextricable disappointment when a relationship doesn’t bloom  fortunately i’ve been able to keep all of this selfsabotage from ever getting completely out of hand i’m perhaps somewhere in the middle on the spectrum of addiction i make rent in new york city as a fulltime freelance writer generally keep in respectable physical health and maintain close friendships and relations with my family i’ve just always felt a little more shitty throughout adulthood than perhaps necessary  on wednesday 11 march tom hanks announced he’d contracted the coronavirus the national basketball association postponed its games indefinitely and president trump suspended most travel from europe though new york was still more than a week away from officially sheltering in place all of that news was enough to keep me in my apartment save for excursions to the pharmacy and supermarket and exercise in the form of walks through my neighborhood  the panic for me would arrive soon a number of publications i’ve worked closely with on a freelance basis ceased publishing stories from nonstaff writers over budget concerns i worried whether i’d be able to sustain myself financially through the crisis but overwhelmed by anxiety i could barely muster the energy to find new revenue streams i worked two or three hours a day if that in spite of the threat to my financial status  one thing was certain however i was doing a decent job of staying present though at times i really wanted a bourbon i thankfully didn’t bend i worked out in my living room and still regularly ate salads for dinner my therapist lori reminded me that i had savings in place for just such an occasion and most importantly no one close to me was sick or dead from the virus  i couldn’t believe this was happening am i really hitting it off this well with someone right now  i slowly realized i was in a much better position than many others and the panic i initially felt subsided  however old habits die hard i still hadn’t had a drink but my exercise routine had all but dissolved food delivery emerged as a frequent guilty pleasure and i reinstalled hinge on my phone perhaps a callback to less emotionally sound times  then on saturday 28 march with new york city now the global center of the pandemic allie liked my profile  i’d hit so many dead ends on dating apps that i’d grown weary of the whole matching affair which again calls into question why i was even on the thing just looking to mentally check out of the moment but her big smile compelled me to match back she’s also an editor and at 45 a few years older than me so i presumed she had some mature life experiences behind her and would be looking for serious prospects only willing to invest in a relationship – like i would be if i were technically “dating”  the likelihood of a romantic connection seemed slim if only because there was probably no way i’d be able to see her in person for months maybe we could be friends and forge a new connection that would help us through the pandemic or perhaps there was a networking opportunity to be had for both of us  we only exchanged a couple of texts before i wrote if you’re comfortable with this i’d rather not go on and on texting … i’d prefer to maybe do a lowstakes pandemic phone call or vidchat how’s that sound  when i’m single i’m always looking for my partner my person and with the video component i felt the pandemic would be the perfect time to get to know someone without the pressure of sex i’m not just looking to hook up with people so if you can get to know someone this way right now why not i also thought that dating virtually could be a little bit of a distraction from the pandemic sure – allie in an interview on 17 april  for the first time ever i scheduled a zoom meeting for 7 pm that same night i felt victorious upon seeing allie’s face and hearing her voice through my laptop we spoke for about an hour and 20 minutes both opening up about how we were dealing with the quarantine because this is such a somber moment – and i think because i truly had zero expectations – i was at ease discussing my history of anxiety depression and failed romances including one marriage allie absorbed it all in stride – even my bare foot which unbeknownst to me repeatedly made appearances in the corner of her screen she later told me the foot was distracting but then thought to herself well at least he’s comfortable so that’s nice  when i asked her if she’d ever been married she said yes telling me her husband had died of cancer a few years ago she disclosed some of the details of his fight which lasted two years and the heartbreak she felt over his passing sympathy poured out of me but connecting with someone who’s endured such hard knocks only to emerge cheerful and optimistic was both sobering and exciting  our second zoom date a couple of nights later lasted about two hours we chatted about our families and work lives we weren’t flirty with each other at all – because why – but after closing my laptop i was struck by a desire to kiss her  i couldn’t believe this was happening am i really hitting it off this well with someone right now  after our titillating third date allie and i had another zoom meeting “for coffee” that sunday we had two more dates that week including one “trip to the movies” on saturday the 11th watching guess who’s coming to dinner on netflix at the same time and chatting about it over zoom afterward each of those conversations lasted hours and we snuck some facetime calls in between too as we talked we’d catch our faces getting closer together leaning into the cameras before long we were blowing kisses to each other – though out of fears that we’d become too emotionally invested we’ve avoided any attempt at videochat sex since date three  allie seems to get more beautiful every time i talk to her and the thing i might like most about her is her uncanny ability to sidestep cynical approaches to life and instead travel an upbeat high road looking at every little thing with a bright perspective like with the onscreen foot incident – a yin to my yang we’ve independently told our families and some friends about each other exercising cautious optimism in framing the relationship so far everyone’s been openminded supportive and happy for us  at the end of one impromptu facetime on 10 april i started fishing for hints on how strongly she felt about me this can’t be “real” right work had started to pick up for me and i had to hang up to get some stuff done but something inside me was pushing to stay on the call with her resigning to finally xout of our talk i said “maybe let me know you miss me later if that’s a thing that happens for you … ”  she laughed and said “sure”  a few minutes later she texted “i miss you🙃” i took the emoji as verification that yes she too was a bit puzzled by the fact that this budding relationship could somehow feel so special  “thank you” i texted back “i miss you all the time what is this lol”  “haha awww \\U0001f970” she wrote back  i thrive in relationships where my partner is forthcoming when i’m with someone and they’re open it’s better to know what’s going on so it can be addressed than to have them hide their feelings even if they’re not the most savory of emotions or thoughts when i think about ‘how did this get so deep so quickly’ that’s a big part of it – allie  •••  over the course of our conversations allie and i openly wondered if we were only bonding as eagerly as we were to avoid confronting our fears of the globalcrisis reality i was particularly concerned because of my mental health history and i began thinking this could be another instance where i was engaging in relatively selfdestructive behavior  but allie wasn’t deterred by her worried feelings or mine  “i’ve already been through the worst thing that could happen to a person in a relationship” she once said referencing the death of her husband “if this doesn’t work out – even if we never see each other in person or if we do and we realize this isn’t really viable – i’ll get through it and just try and meet someone else”  what emotional strife am i subjecting myself to by buying into a relationship crafted in such an odd unprecedented stretch in my life and the world  in my core i feel the same way i have gotten through a divorce and another breakup with a woman i lived with for nearly two years still what emotional strife am i subjecting myself to by buying into a relationship crafted in such an odd unprecedented stretch in my life and the world  i eventually spoke about allie with lori my therapist over skype  “so i’m ‘seeing’ someone” i told her nervously and with air quotes  therapy is the one place where i always feel safe lori and i have built trust over the course of years and as a result i’m able to remain more present in her company and tap deeply into my emotions talking to lori that day i was worried i might reveal to myself that i wasn’t on as strong an emotional footing in this new relationship as i’d hoped  but that didn’t happen  lori said she thought allie sounded “lovely” though she did advise me to proceed – as in any other situation of such gravity – with mindfulness and an awareness that meeting allie in person could change things between her and me quickly  “of course” i said unsure if my heart was synchronized with my mind  by saturday 11 april two weeks after my first videochat with allie we set a date 18 april would be our first inperson meeting at her place where she lives alone the topic like everything else between us just came up organically i’m not sure who mentioned it first but it was clear that we both wanted to be together in the flesh there have been many moments where when we’ve held our respective cameras close up to ourselves we felt like we could literally reach out and touch each other but that wasn’t enough persontoperson contact was fast becoming a must  “i’ll take an uber to your place” i said “i’ll wash my hands as soon as i get inside too”  “make sure you wear a mask and some gloves please” she added  the fact that she was opening her home up to me of all people under these circumstances was in a strange way incredibly romantic  standing in my kitchen later that saturday afternoon i talked with my roommate steve a pseudonym checking in on how each of us was getting along in quarantine i mentioned without much thought that i was planning on seeing allie in person at her apartment the following saturday  “i gotta say the thought of you going over there gives me a little anxiety” steve said “it’s a risk to you but also to me”  “well sure” i said “but i’m going to be very careful i’ll take an uber there and back i’ll wear a mask and gloves during the rides wash my hands right away all that stuff”  he was appreciative but presumed – correctly – that i wouldn’t go all the way to allie’s place to sit six feet away from her the whole time  “i’m sure she’s been careful and that she’s trustworthy but you never really know do you” he said  “i guess but if i really thought the risk to your health was significant i wouldn’t go” i said “if you want to tell me not to go that’s fine i don’t want you to be resentful”  “you’re an adult” he responded “i’m not going to tell you what you can and can’t do i’m just saying if you see her it’s going to be something that i’ll worry about for a while afterward”  is this another instance where i’m bent on making a rash decision with consequences i’m not considering  he then said something that hit hard “i have a friend who lives just a few blocks away and i’d love to go hang out with them but i’m not because they could get me sick and then i can get you sick”  is this another instance where i’m bent on making a rash decision with consequences i’m not considering  it wasn’t long ago in therapy that lori reminded me of life’s “golden rule” which is to “treat others as you would like to be treated” of course i’d heard that phrase since probably before kindergarten but it had begun to resonate with me more strongly in our session that particular day just prior to the quarantine to live by such a code is not only humbling but also a way to slow down your mind consider another’s feelings and stay present  the secret life of an anonymous speechwriter to the stars read more  after hearing steve out i took the time to truly deliberate over the right course of action i decided to wait to see allie but as i committed my mind to calling off our first inperson date i felt crushed by sadness when i talked to lori about the episode she applauded my responsible decision and we called attention to the fact that if i’d gone to see allie i might have had a wonderful time with her but i’d have added more worries to my plate about getting sick and getting others sick in the aftermath  allie completely understood – just like her  “i wish it could happen but i totally get why it can’t right now” she said “you’re not the one who lives alone so you have to be sensitive to your roommate”  it’s only a matter of time before the shelterinplace guidelines are eased in new york and we can hang out together at her place talking for hours eating lunch and dinner watching a movie and making out at the very least only then might i get over the fear that she won’t be attracted to me in person as i write this our governor is happily reporting that the number of statewide daily coronavirus hospitalizations is decreasing and his administration is already in the planning stages of a “reopening”  when i discuss the idea of writing this piece with allie i tell her that i’ll pitch something with a title like “falling in love in the time of coronavirus”  “do you think that would be an appropriate way to frame this” i ask her my voice trembling with nerves fishing again for insight into her feelings for me  “yeah i would say so” she responds and a sense of relief washes over me “in fact i just wrote in my journal the other day that i think we’re falling for each other”  aside from that offhand mention we’re not officially dropping the lword yet i think we both know that would be too absurd at this point all we can do is continue to get to know each other safely over zoom  which is still pretty great  when it’s the right person it doesn’t matter how it all starts not knowing for sure about things – in relationships or a lot of other developments – is part of life i think there’s something really pure about just going for it and if things don’t work out between us i would feel like ‘well at least it was a good story i connected with someone during a global pandemic in a profound way and we tried’  – allie  this story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform narratively looking for

important that the wrong dimensions messed with the texture it is true that a thinner flapjack will have a more biscuity less squidgy mouthfeel but biscuity is still fine otherwise why would people eat biscuits it is also true that the finer the oats the more they hold together in the finished product but even jumbo oats didn’t fall apart as i had been led to believe but if this really worries you you can make them finer by whizzing them first in a food processor anyway  having said that all flapjacks are equally good it would be contradictory to claim that these are the 10 best think of them rather as a flapjack for every taste  the nostalgia flapjack  the pooh cook book loosely based on the sensibilities of winnie the pooh came out in 1971 if you were born between then and about 1985 it will have provided the building blocks of your first cooking experiences even if you never read it trust me i was there  anyway its flapjack – 50g butter 50g sugar 100g oats one tablespoon of golden syrup pinch of salt 160c 140c fan350fgas mark 3 for 20 minutes – is basically a rationbook version of the classic recipe generally there is more fat than oats and with a much smaller yield that should be enough for two hungry children that’s what really stands out about recipes written before the 90s how incredibly small they are  the perfect flapjack  you want perfection go to the person whose middle name it is our own felicity cloake identified the two fundamental schools of flapjackery as crunchy or chewy and comes down herself very firmly on the side of crunchy much more syrup than sugar in this one and she’s quite strict on the size of the oats 5050 jumbo to rolled but the main way to assure more crunch is a shallower baking tray in a hotter oven  facebook twitter pinterest it is possible to give flapjacks a luxurious considered aesthetic photograph sugar0607gettyistockphoto  the classy flapjack  baking genius dan lepard was unaccountably looking for a way to reduce the fat and sugar content of a flapjack and discovered that even a small amount of tahini  75g – had a fudgifying effect on the other ingredients which reduced the need for both butter and sugar the ingredients list – featuring dates walnuts sesame seeds honey – means it isn’t for someone looking for something simple but will be ideal if you want to winnow your weird stockpiles  the hipster flapjack  victoria glass is a terribly talented baker whose technical skills i often find a bit out of my league nevertheless these chocolate flapjacks are terrific as simple as a regular flapjack but with a distinctive considered aesthetic  the vegan flapjack  there are variations of this recipe all over instagram though i have found no reputable chef that would put their name to them the nodairy nosugar nonuffink flapjack basically you take mashed banana and oats of any size in roughly equal quantities before you mix them toast the oats in a frying pan with enough coconut oil to coat then add the banana and some kind of nut or seed butter or more coconut oil if you’re minded  you can add as much dried fruit as you think it’ll take without falling apart and these have to be baked in biscuits rather than squares because they’re too mouthdrying otherwise but they work surprisingly well i think due to the initial toasting of the oats which brings depth of flavour  my small and i agreed though that they just weren’t sweet enough and tried again twice with golden syrup and agave the golden syrup was the best for a twobanana mix i added in two tablespoons but feel free to adjust to taste  facebook twitter pinterest assorted flapjacks  ‘you can basically add anything you happen to have around’ photograph daseafordgettyistockphoto  the tasteslikeashopmadeit flapjack  the industrialised flapjack has a very distinctive texture which like shopbought chocolate cake is incredibly hard to replicate at home that’s fine if you’re dead proud of your home baking but not if you actually prefer the shop version the answer came unexpectedly from a recipe shared by anna botting the sky presenter on twitter condensed milk she uses the unsweetened version but i am obsessed with the regular stuff and can attest these have a wonderful shopbought squidge and also taste like condensed milk  the scottish flapjack  not a traditionally scottish snack just from the marvellous scottish baking by sue lawrence it’s a versatile recipe that basically lets you add anything you happen to have around raisins apricots coconut flaked almonds whatever and is also the only one that uses any flour even in a small amount it makes them a bit more cakelike  the luxury flapjack  flapjacks are about as rich as life gets and yet you can heap richness upon them to create something 10 times richer but just as delicious like this bbc good food recipe for chocolate and caramel flapjacks it’s the kind of maths that only the flapjack truly understands just as only jeff bezos understands why you’d want to be a trillionaire when you’re already a billionaire  facebook twitter pinterest a flapjack drizzled with white chocolate photograph joff leegetty  the tropical flapjack  the birminghambased mostly vegan but not inflexibly so domestic gothess fancied up the classic recipe here with coconut and ginger and if you can overcome your inner purist i have to say these are the most interesting the flavour still has a lot of clarity it just sounds a few more notes  the nutsandseeds flapjack  almost all recipes that suggest any seeds and nuts will allow for infinite variations this bbc good food one is seeds only mainly this is because you’re not really trying to pick out finer flavour differences between a pumpkin and a sunflower seed you’re looking for more

because “he doesn’t know he’s alive” at others the president speaks of biden as a wily manipulator who conspired with the deep state and china  who is tara reade and what are her allegations against joe biden read more  but in this scattergun approach the us president has been uncharacteristically reluctant to use what in normal times would seem standard political ammunition an allegation of sexual assault  it took more than a month after tara reade a former senate staffer alleged on a podcast that biden sexually assaulted her in a capitol hill basement in 1993 for trump to publicly address the matter  even then the us president’s comments on 30 april were unusually milquetoast “i don’t know anything about it” trump said “i don’t know exactly – i think he should respond you know it could be false accusations i know all about false accusations i’ve been falsely charged numerous times and there is such a thing”  then speaking on fox news’s fox  friends usually a comfort zone he again declined to go for biden’s jugular “look he’s got to fight that battle” he said “i’ve had battles too where i’ve had false accusations many times i’ve had many false accusations made i can tell you that many and maybe it is a false accusation frankly i hope it is for his sake”  the first and most obvious explanation for the president’s reticence is that he himself has been accused of assault and unwanted touching by a long list of women some far more recently than reade’s account he also denies the allegations on the other hand trump has never allowed perceived double standards to get in the way of his scorched earth tactics in the past  monika mcdermott a political science professor at fordham university in new york said “it’s surprising in a way because usually trump doesn’t pull back on things even when they do seem hypocritical or ironic or choose your adjective yet he is in this particular instance i don’t know if he’s waiting for something to happen or whether he’s waiting to see how it plays out before he does anything he seems to be finding what seem to him more fruitful attack routes against obama and other things and people than against biden right now”  in 2016 trump’s campaign was rocked by the release of an access hollywood tape in which he could heard bragging about using his fame to grab women’s private parts instead of quitting he went on the offensive against his rival hillary clinton by highlighting sexual assault allegations against her husband former president bill clinton and even inviting those accusers to a press conference before a presidential debate  but this november will witness the first presidential election since the rise of the metoo movement which has encouraged women to come forward with allegations of sexual assault against prominent men in politics show business and other industries  facebook twitter pinterest a screen grab of joe biden and dr jill biden hosting a family town hall on the covid19 pandemic from their home in wilmington delaware last month photograph brian cahnzuma wirerexshutterstock  biden has committed to picking a woman as his running mate and frequently cites his work as lead sponsor of the violence against women act both candidates are keenly aware that suburban women could be a pivotal demographic in the final vote  while trump remains taciturn republicans have instead focused much of their response on brett kavanaugh the supreme court justice whose nomination was nearly derailed by sexual misconduct allegations the trump campaign pointed to statements made by democrats during the kavanaugh episode to portray them as hypocritical  erin perrine principal deputy communications director at the trump campaign said “during justice kavanaugh’s hearings biden made clear that all women should be believed when they come forward with allegations of sexual assault biden’s own work during the obama administration lowered standards for such accusations on college campuses as to effectively institute a presumption of guilt in a dramatic shift biden now says ‘believe women’ doesn’t actually mean ‘believe women’”  trump himself however has preferred to take aim at other targets seeking to implicate biden in a socalled “obamagate” conspiracy that many seen as an attempt to deflect attention from the coronavirus pandemic – likely to prove a more significant issue in november  amid democratic alarm that the reade allegation could dent biden’s support among women the former vicepresident vehemently denied it in an interview on the msnbc network on 1 may and repeated that position in a series of media appearances  the story has faded from prominence in recent days especially after the pbs newshour interviewed 74 former biden staffers of whom 62 were women and found none said that they had experienced sexual harassment assault or misconduct by biden nor ever heard rumors or allegations to that effect  by pushing the case trump may have more to lose than to gain rich galen a former republican strategist said “the case against biden keeps getting thinner and thinner so i’m not sure that there’s much there and all the people who’s accused trump it would be like listing the names of the people who died in vietnam every night”  michael steele former chairman of the republican national committee added “trump if nothing else knows how to read his audience ‘no they’re not going to buy anything i sell on this point’ there’s no need to even open that pandora’s box because it’s a pandora’s box for him not joe biden i think that’s why the president has largely decided not to engage at that level  “my sense is right now despite what others in the campaign may want to do there is no energy from the president himself to open up that door and go through it”']\n",

postpunk scene we reveal the feuds filched raincoats and grotty flats that set her on the path to stardom  if you were in liverpool in 1982 and had a habit of wandering down mathew street perhaps on your way to probe record store you are likely to have seen courtney love she was 17 and living in the city having been invited there by teardrop explodes frontman julian cope probe was one of her favourite places to go – if not to buy records then to sit outside on the steps drinking cider with her friend from back home in america robin barbur  a hundred yards from probe was the site of eric’s from 1976 to 1980 eric’s had hosted everyone from the ramones to joy division one band formed by the venue’s regulars was big in japan with lineups including jayne casey later of pink military bill drummond later of the klf holly johnson later of frankie goes to hollywood and ian broudie later of the lightning seeds “we were the most damaged children society turned out that year” recalls casey “and we just happened to be on stage together”  love wanted to get close to them particularly the teardrop explodes and echo  the bunnymen she later recalled seeing ian mcculloch of the bunnymen “swanning around” the city “he used to wear a big thick coat and glasses and hang out with pete wylie and mumble” wylie of the band wah heat also had a big coat liverpool winters are cold – but the coats stayed on at parties and gigs love claims she once stole mcculloch’s but he isn’t so sure “i think she might have stolen a look rather than actual clothes but if she did good luck to her”

punkette” she was loud that’s something everyone agrees on pete burns later of the band dead or alive had a clothes shop at the back of probe in his autobiography freak unique he described how it felt to be assailed by love “it’s like when a baby throws a rattle across the room and screams because it can’t communicate”  love’s parents linda risi and hank harrison met at a party for dizzy gillespie in san francisco in 1963 “we were doing tons of acid” harrison recalled “changing sex partners and tripping out” apparently he managed the warlocks in 1965 before they became the grateful dead risi then 19 came from a wealthy family love’s grandparents provided her with a trust fund of 500 a month this paid for the trip to liverpool  facebook twitter pinterest ‘before liverpool my life doesn’t

1970 a custody battle ensued risi and one of harrison’s girlfriends testified that he had given his daughter lsd when she was four  by the end of 1973 risi had moved to new zealand leaving love behind she was just eight she finally ended up in an institution for wayward teenagers after being caught shoplifting by the time she was 17 she had decided to leave behind her unhappy san francisco childhood and in 1981 set off for ireland she moved into a squat in dublin and started hanging out at music venue mcgonagles where she collided with the postpunk liverpool scene  the teardrop explodes played dublin in december according to bernie connor who was mates with cope and sold tshirts on the tour love passed the monitor engineer a note for julian “are you married” it said “so courtney comes back to the hotel” continues connor “attaches herself and gravitates a little closer to julian with every passing minute”  cope gave love and barbur his liverpool address and said they could stay neglecting to mention he wouldn’t be there they soon moved in to a “horrible” flat in princes avenuelove recorded it all in her diary from the “textured tawnybeigegreen and brownsilver and

1982 john peel broadcast a radio 1 show live from liverpool the weeklong extravaganza fuelled and celebrated the scene that so thrilled the girls it was a time of energy and ambition with bitchiness galore  while the sharptongued burns was often at the centre of the acrimony one feud – between cope and mcculloch – has had a staggering shelf life the pair haven’t had a good thing to say about each other in the four decades since in liverpool making music and making enemies went hand in hand – a lesson that would stand love in good stead  david balfe at liverpool label zoo was keen to launch a female version of soft cell so he lent her a synth and a fourtrack recorder she didn’t know how to use them but his enthusiasm galvanised her as for the compositions it seems her sludgecoloured flat came in handy “i went on about porridge” she recalled “because all we had was porridge” while she describes the songs as “stupid” they at least reflected her life in liverpool one of the first numbers was an ode to cope with a chorus beginning “julian julian where have you been”  love once once said “before liverpool my life doesn’t count ian mcculloch and julian cope taught me a great deal i owe them a lot liverpool had been a great school to become a rock star”  facebook twitter pinterest ‘you buy a guitar and it burns like a coal in your hand’ … love fronting hole in 1995 photograph ian dicksonrexshutterstock  understanding the mechanics of songwriting and finding ways to channel influences and experiences is important – but attitude counts too “julian told us to live your life as if you’re being followed by a movie camera” barbur later said “i remember courtney started walking very selfassuredly head up fast”  a decade later when love was the frontwoman of hole and married to nirvana’s kurt cobain cope took out an advert in the nme that said of her “free us from nancy spungenfixated heroin aholes who cling to our greatest groups and suck out their brains” what was it that had got under cope’s skin “she was always in your face” says connor “i was able to detach myself whereas she lasered in on him i can understand it oppressing him”  barbur is less forgiving “julian was crazy it was part of the charm i don’t want to be a bitch but maybe by this point she’d got a little famous and he’d got a little bit bitter he hadn’t seen her since she was 17 18 he probably saw this bratty obnoxious girl was now a superstar pretty much and thought ‘damn her’ i don’t know she really adored julian”  love wrote to cope and said that his ad had made her violently ill “imagine that it’s 1983 82 81 and 80 you’re a teenage piece of white trash and not even remotely decorative but you love the great rock dream and it’s all you’ve got … and you buy a guitar and it burns like a coal in your hand and you feel some power and for once it isn’t the power of being made fun of or picked on it’s … the power to change the fucking world”  i suggest to connor that if love had been a bloke with handfuls of drugs bowling through life all mouthy and opinionated then she’d have been treated like some hero from a kerouac novel “undoubtedly we were very young and so was she and being in your face like that that was new we were quiet young fellas it was a closed little network”  facebook twitter pinterest ‘best british band ever’ … ian mcculloch of the bunnymen photograph leon morrisgetty

the top even pete wylie’s wah scaled the top five with the story of the blues so the city love left kept loudly knocking out hits having shown a girl who had grown up with no one listening to her how to assert her identity and what was possible  on 21 july 1982 she caught the national express bus to heathrow stopping off for egg and chips in the midlands at the airport she wrote in her diary “i can play music and understand technology i can stay in and resist the temptation to make the first move or stay too long or worse get intense i can make tea now i can remain enigmatic pose well and appear feminine” she thinks about all the people she met and concludes “there’s one asset everyone has until they’ve spent it their mystique”  ahead lay fame some terrible choices loss and hurt

            "['322', 'mike pompeo is the number one evangelist of trumpism in the world  michael h fuchs', 'donald trump’s disdain for the people country and values his office is supposed to represent is unmatched in recent memory and he has found in the secretary of state mike pompeo a kindred spirit who has embraced his role as trumpism’s number one proselytizer to the world  pompeo doesn’t wield nearly as much power or have the jurisdiction to inflict damage on as wide a range of issues as the president he’s not as crass or erratic as trump and his twitter feed seems dedicated more to childish mockery than outright attacks but when it comes to foreign policy pompeo’s penchant for undermining america’s credibility is topnotch  at pompeo’s recommendation trump fired the state department’s inspector general who is supposed to be an independent investigator charged with looking into potential wrongdoing inside the department steve linick was just the latest in a series of inspectors general across the government that trump had fired in an attempt to hide the misconduct of his administration – but it also shone a spotlight on how pompeo has undermined his agency  watchdog was investigating pompeo for arms deal and staff misuse before firing read more  according to news reports pompeo was being investigated by the inspector general for bypassing congress and possibly breaking the law in sending weapons to saudi arabia even though his own department and the rest of the us government advised against the decision he was also supposedly organizing fancy dinners – paid for by taxpayers – with influential businesspeople and tv personalities that seemed geared more towards supporting pompeo’s political career than advancing us foreign policy goals and he was reportedly being scrutinized for using department personnel to conduct personal business such as getting dry cleaning and walking his dog  but these revelations merely reaffirm a pattern of activities by pompeo unbecoming of the nation’s top diplomat when the house of representatives was in the process of impeaching trump over his attempt to extort ukraine for personal political purposes – an act that pompeo was aware of – pompeo defended trump while throwing under the bus career state department officials like the ousted us ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch who spoke out pompeo has regularly ignored congress withholding documents from lawmakers – including during the ukraine impeachment investigation – and refusing to appear for testimony in 2019 the ig released a report detailing political retaliation against career state department officials being perpetrated by trump officials and pompeo has spent considerable time traveling to kansas and conducting media interviews there fueling speculation that he has been using his position to tee up a run for the senate a violation of the hatch act  pompeo is a natural trumpist in her fantastic profile of the secretary of state susan glasser notes of his first congressional race “pompeo ran a nasty race against the democrat an indianamerican state legislator named raj goyle who unlike pompeo had grown up in wichita pompeo’s campaign tweeted praise for an article calling goyle a ‘turban topper’ and a supporter bought billboards urging residents to ‘vote american – vote pompeo’” later as a member of congress pompeo made a name for himself by helping to fabricate the benghazi conspiracy theories that shamelessly used the memory of a deceased foreign service officer to undermine the state department  facebook twitter pinterest ‘trump is undermining american leadership in incalculable ways and pompeo has weaponized the state department on the president’s behalf’ photograph kevin lamarquereuters  next to trump’s assault on us values pompeo’s role as top trump lackey may seem insignificant but the secretary of state is often the most senior us official that other countries and publics hear from on any number of issues even with trump in the oval office a secretary of state that was committed to the constitution  not trump  would at least be able to fight for the values that us foreign policy should embody and shield the department’s daytoday business from trump’s outbursts the work that department professionals conduct around the world – helping american citizens abroad get home in the early days of the pandemic or coordinating assistance to other countries to cope with the coronavirus – is vital to american national security and at the core of the image that america projects abroad  trump is undermining american leadership in incalculable ways and pompeo has weaponized the state department on his behalf  the world today needs principled and active us leadership as much as ever in a normal world the us secretary of state would be working through international organizations like the who to lead the response to the coronavirus not threatening to withdraw from the global body the secretary would be pushing for robust foreign assistance to help other countries fight the pandemic not cutting funding they would be trying to find a path that balances working with china on responding to the pandemic with pushing back on the chinese communist party’s disturbing behavior – like signaling it may end hong kong’s autonomy – instead of scapegoating china  but trump is undermining american leadership in incalculable ways and pompeo has weaponized the state department on the president’s behalf like trump pompeo’s behavior is sending signals to other countries that the us government is acting more like the autocratic and corrupt regimes that pompeo so regularly calls out as trump hurls daily attacks on the media pompeo has taken to berating journalists these assaults by america’s leaders on the free press are giving cover to dictators around the world to criticize their countries’ media firing government watchdogs who are investigating

enter the restaurant when his childish attempt to reenter holding the mask in his hand was rebuffed – i literally have a face mask what is your problem – he created an altercation that ended in a nonfatal shooting  a church was burned down in mississippi after the pastor tried to sue the city because of its interference with its services the pastor was still gathering people for worship despite the stayathome order and the spread of the coronavirus after the church burned someone found graffiti that read “bet you stay home now you hypokrits sic”  a man was arrested in missouri after he licked a bunch of items at the walmart while yelling “who’s scared of coronavirus” a woman was arrested in california for licking groceries a woman coughed on some produce in pennsylvania as a “prank” a cop “jokingly” coughed on residents in baltimore  so people are not really managing their anxiety about the coronavirus very well the threat is real people are dying and even some early covid19 deniers have been brought around by witnessing sickness and death but the messaging about what to do about it has been inconsistent and contradictory with rules changing from city to city state to state to cut through the confusion the simplest thing should be immediately required in every public setting masks should be made mandatory  the jerks and trolls will always be with us but if everyone else is wearing a mask at least they’ll be easier to spot  i know that making a nationwide order to wear masks in public is not going to prevent all waffle house shootings – no law yet created has been able to stop such an inevitability but during times of uncertainty we look to our leaders to tell us what we should do and where are all of our agents of authority our president says to wear a mask but he’s not wearing a mask he says we should keep our distance then he shakes everyone’s hand at the press conference mike pence doesn’t wear a mask during a visit to the mayo clinic but later says he regrets it cops are walking the streets all the time without masks the people we usually look to for guidance are either being deliberately confusing or at best cavalier and reckless  people are having to rethink every aspect of their lives right now how do i make my sixyearold watch this video about math while also attending a zoom call while also constantly refreshing instacart to see if a delivery window has opened up for groceries how do i navigate the unemployment benefits registration system when millions of others are all calling at the same time how do i get from one place to another when even the thought of getting on a subway causes nervous collapse we should help people out by establishing one certainty when you go outside you put on a mask  please do not talk to me about science right now i’ve read the science it is contradictory and official announcements about the science are constantly changing plus when you are outside on your one daily reminder that the sun still shines and flowers are in bloom and you are holding the hand of your child whose mask is always somehow sticky and slipping and a jogger is coming at you and not getting off the sidewalk and sweating and puffing all over you as he passes without a shirt on is that really the time to start googling “coronavirus transmission risk from joggers” read five or six different sources and determine what the chances are that maybe you just got infected joggers you are freaking people out wear a mask  and i am tired of reading the science i just want to take some things for granted so i can use my brain for other things like wondering about whether or not my cat knows he is a cat or how are his feet are so small these are the important things of life  people are clearly anxious about reopening and one of the easiest ways to ease that anxiety is to require everyone to wear a mask and pay everyone a monthly stimulus and create medicare for all to help everyone who just lost benefits when they were furloughed or laid off and organize workplaces to reduce hours and provide adequate protective gear and avoid physical contact with people or potentially infected surfaces  people love their “freedom” in this country by which of course i mean the freedom to freak people out by wearing a gun in public or trolling people with death threats just for the giggles and they will want to argue about the order to wear a mask “debate me bro” they’ll all shout as they trot out the one piece of “scientific” information they misread in passing on social media between a video of a parrot dancing to a nicki minaj song and a stranger’s tearful and heartfelt defense of some multimillionaire celebrity whose feelings were recently hurt by mean comments  but no actually i don’t want to debate you about whether masks protect you or the people around you in the same way as i don’t want to debate about whether the earth is round or flat or whether vaccines cause autism can’t you just feel smug about being right deep down in your heart you can even talk about it if you want as long as the sound of your voice is being muffled by layers of fabric featuring your favorite disney character the jerks and trolls will always be with us but if everyone else is wearing a mask at least they’ll be easier to spot  mandatory orders need to be enforced and that creates its own issues in contemporary american society as the cops tackling mostly black men and women in the name of “enforcing social distancing” and throwing people into crowded cells without soap or hand sanitizer shows

by angry people” he tweeted    given beijing’s dislike for protests of any kind that seems unlikely yet hu raised a question relevant to all countries ravaged by covid19 where is the fury the public outrage faced by the inability of incompetent governments to protect them why have the people not risen up erected figurative scaffolds and guillotines and set a torch to the established political order  in other words when does the revolution begin furloughed workers of the world unite you have nothing to lose but your supply chains  given the history of the past century or so today’s politicians democratic or authoritarian left or right may count themselves fortunate not to be experiencing a fiercer backlash this may be brewing once people regain their nerve many countries have seen smallscale covidrelated protests yet by and large insurrection has not gone viral – yet    that’s despite a consensus among business leaders scientists and pundits that the world will never be the same again a watershed has been reached they say mostly older people are suffering now but millions among the younger generations may have their lives forcibly upended for years to come like it or not a second age of revolution is dawning    so the real question is not whether but what manner of revolution is coming will it be of the uncontrollable ideological 20thcentury variety associated with the likes of marx mao guevara and castro or will it take the form of a nonviolent but nonetheless rapid and profound shift in the way a more consciously interdependent world works an awful lot rests on how the pandemic’s shockwaves and aftereffects are directed and shaped  the main elements of political revolutions have not changed much since aristotle identified them more than 2300 years ago whatever the objective he wrote in book v of the politics inequality is the chief cause of revolution justice and equality are “the fundamental basis of any state” and inequality being a kind of injustice is potent grounds for challenging that state “the lesser rebel in order to be equal the equal in order to be greater these then are conditions predisposing to revolution” aristotle declared  amid epidemic uncertainty two things are clear first the virus is universal and ubiquitous – a threat to all humankind second its impacts are deeply unequal decisively determined by social class race ethnicity income nutrition education living conditions and geographical location as well as by gender and age  if you don’t have a situation where people have opportunity … you’re threatening the existence of the system ray dalio hedge fund billionaire  it follows that the large unjust societal inequalities found both within and between wealthy and developing countries and ruthlessly exposed by the virus are just as powerfully insurrectionary in nature today as when aristotle first pondered them or when marieantoinette told starving peasants to eat cake  the danger that entrenched inequality poses to hopes of weathering the covid storm without chaotic upheavals was recently debated by the tsars of modern american capitalism “this is our chance to do the right thing” by reducing income disparities said top investor mark cuban ray dalio a hedgefund billionaire described inequality as a national emergency  “if you don’t have a situation where people have opportunity you’re not only failing to tap all the potential that exists which is uneconomic you’re threatening the existence of the system” dalio said jp morgan’s chief executive jamie dimon called the pandemic “a wakeup call … for business and government to think act and invest for the common good” this sounds almost socialistic    a revolutionary agenda for the postpandemic world also includes meaningful steps to address poverty and the northsouth wealth gap more urgent approaches to linked climate energy water and mass extinction crises and for example the adoption of socalled doughnut economics that measures prosperity by counting shared social health and environmental benefits not gdp growth    it may seem like pie in the sky but so too did the idea of millions working from home and halting road and air travel until it happened almost overnight whether recognised as such or not this is a revolutionary manifesto that if it is pursued – as a growing body of opinion believes it must be – will demand the utter transformation of current political behaviour and organisation  there is revolution in the air now but history shows the old order will fight back  nesrine malik read more  in the us the increasing lawlessness of the trump plutocracy coupled with its highhanded pandemic response has exposed the inadequacy of democratic checks and balances created more than 200 years ago what’s

constructive global engagement    in britain centralised topdown mismanagement of the pandemic has underscored a crisis of representative governance and national cohesion to survive as a united

estimates in two weeks” owner laura spaulding told the tampa bay times “in that period normally it might be 100000”  the company which has 24 offices across the country has had its phones “ringing off the hook” and has been scrambling to hire extra workers to fulfill demand from restaurants banks government buildings gyms and daycare facilities even flying crews around the country to help in the busiest places  everyone’s been trapped indoors which has been good news for a st louis company called puzzle warehouse the company has been breaking records selling puzzles games and toys shipping seven times the amount of items normally seen online and logging six times more sales in their store “we’re not selling necessities” marketing manager greg brown told the riverfront times “we’re selling something to keep you entertained”  meanwhile the online world has been booming according to one report ecommerce ad spending alone doubled in march as consumers were forced to buy more stuff online of course the giants like amazon have benefited but so also have the small craft makers on etsy they saw demand for masks explode with the online platform disclosing that more than 12m face masks were sold during april accounting for about 133m in sales “it was like waking up and discovering it was cyber monday except everyone in the world just wanted one product and that product was in extremely limited supply” etsy’s chief executive josh silverman said in a report by the verge it wasn’t just masks – etsy reported that sales of other items surged 79 during the period too  when

the only deliveries that people are demanding portland oregonbased milkrun which connects consumers to farmers in their communities to buy local meat dairy produce and more saw its deliveries of these

face masks and respirators but iron we know how to pour” george boyd the company’s vicepresident told a local news station “so when we realized there was a shortage of kettle bells and dumbbells we went in to help fill that void”  and then there are the unforeseen businesses that have benefited from the pandemic for example there are people using online neighborhood community site nextdoor to barter goods and services which has created an unexpected surge in traffic and ad revenues for the social service in cities across the country there are the chiropractors in pittsburgh who report increased demand from workfromhome employees complaining of back and neck pains there’s the unprecedented demand for cobol programmers because the ancient computer language was used to construct many state unemployment systems that now need adjustments to accommodate more visitors and new rules from the federal government there’s a reported comeback in drivein movie theatres as people want to see a good film while also practicing social distancing  finally it’s probably not surprising that many small businesses in one industry are seeing spikes in sales because of the pandemic that of course is the cannabis industry with states like nevada ohio and oregon reporting record sales  “we get to provide a little relief to a stressed society” mishka ashbel the coowner of the mmd cannabis

season – which was suspended due to the covid19 pandemic – possibly as soon as july one of the biggest questions the league will have to answer is where the teams will actually play it turns out the answer may involve the magic kingdom yes the nba has set its sights on walt disney world in orlando florida something which probably raises quite a few questions among sports fans  what the walt disney world the one with mickey mouse and space mountain  the one and the same on espn’s first take los angeles lakers guard danny green confirmed reports that the league was seriously looking into playing games at disney world “it looks like we have multiple options for locations but i think leaning toward orlando and disney to where it’s the safest” green said  soon afterwards the nba released an announcement through spokesperson mike bass “the nba in conjunction with the national basketball players association is engaged in exploratory conversations with the walt disney company about restarting the 201920 nba season in late july at disney’s espn wide world of sports complex in florida as a single site for an nba campus for games practices and housing”  does the plan make any sense  oddly yes if the nba were to restart the season they would want to limit the number of people involved the ideal spot would be a controlled centralized environment in order to lower the risk of outside infection as the nba’s announcement notes disney world would provide its own housing accommodation for players and staff in the form of hotels as well as basketball courts that could handle both practices and official games  it’s hard to imagine a place more controlled than disney world especially since it’s owned by a private entity it also doesn’t hurt that the teams would be situated in florida which seems to be determined to reopen at a quicker pace than most other states in the us whether or not this is especially wise is another question altogether  how did the idea first come about  it was first raised a few weeks ago by yahoo sports writer keith smith who wrote an extended piece which bordered on an advertisement at times about how disney world would be the perfect place for the nba season to resume it seemed on paper to be a ludicrous idea – and some noted smith is a former walt disney world employee but unconventional problems call for unconventional solutions and smith’s idea promptly gained traction within the league itself  how exactly would this work  let’s make this clear players won’t be shooting hoops among the rollercoasters in an interview with sb nation smith made a strong case that it wouldn’t take much to convert preexisting spaces into basketball courts “the espn wide world of sports complex has three primary indoor facilities that would be the hub of this” smith said “i assume two would be set up for games the third is a giant customization space i think they lay out courts in there for practices and possibly shootarounds … if necessary disney could convert some of their own convention space into practice areas”  would playing at disney world cheapen the 201920 season  for some sure for starters it isn’t yet known whether the league could make up all of the regular season games that have yet to be played even if all goes to plan we could end up with a shortened season in fact the league could decide it would make more sense to skip right to the postseason  also having all the games take place in one location would render homecourt advantage essentially meaningless even in the bestcase scenario a nba champion crowned at disney world would probably “feel” different for many fans one doubts that the nba itself is too concerned that people won’t take the remainder of this season seriously – it’s not like the league has had any issues associating its brand with animated characters in the past  what would be the biggest drawbacks  they would be the same drawbacks as trying to continue the nba season anywhere any plan will require frequent testing for covid19 not just of the players but of the other nba and disney world employees who would be in regular contact with them obviously anyone testing positive would have to be immediately quarantined and should the number of positive tests get out of hand the league would probably be forced to shut down for a second time if that happens it could very well be the end of the season  right now the league is having discussions with coronavirus testing providers this leads us to another problem nba commissioner adam silver has made it clear that the season won’t resume until there are enough tests for the rest of the country will we be there by july that’s impossible to say right now  then of course there’s the worstcase scenario let’s assume the season starts up again and as a direct result somebody gets infected and suffers lifealtering health effects or dies what if there are multiple coronavirusrelated deaths because of the resumption it’s something that will weigh on the minds of those deciding whether to play in the middle of a pandemic is the nba so eager to crown a champion for the that it is willing to risk a tragedy at the socalled happiest place on earth the answer is starting to look more and more like “yes”']\n",

tough moments you just want to bat everyone away ‘i’m fine just leave me alone’ it was really frustrating me and a bit of anger came in then my place came under threat for the first time  “the immediate reaction in my head was ‘this can’t be happening they can’t take me out of the team’ i tried to train more be more aggressive i was searching clutching my agent suggested i talk to a sports psychologist who calmed me down by asking ‘do you know how to go in goal’ i said ‘of course’ he went ‘it’s not that then is it’ it turned out it was new goalkeeper coaches trying different styles it made me realise i was going to cost the team the title if i carried on in goal instead of smashing my way through a problem i needed to take stock  “i had a good relationship with the manager and we decided to get myself right away from football so that when i came back i could just enjoy playing again that’s when i’m at my best after five or six games i was back in”  hart helped city win their second premier league title in may 2014 – having been one of the few survivors who had played for the club before they were taken over by the abu dhabi group in 2008 he had been a key figure when they won their first title in 2012 and played under six managers before guardiola changed everything  during all the ups and downs does hart still see the same psychologist “yeah i see jamie on a regular basis he’s become a huge part of my life and someone i’ll always work with having a sports psychologist helped me realise that you can definitely lighten the load if you lean on people it’s so empowering when you open up”  those lessons help him now “i’m going to try and get back in the team and if i don’t there’s always another transfer opportunity there’s no point in sulking i’m still part of the squad it gives you some power if you have a dialogue with the manager it’s important to have that when you’re doing well but it’s even more important when you’re not doing well  it’s going to be very hard pandemic leaves academy players in limbo  ed aarons read more  “i want people who haven’t experienced any adversity in football to learn from this it’s all very well riding the wave but it won’t last for ever every professional i’ve spoken to has had this ride where nothing can go wrong inevitably it’s hard to maintain how we react is something i’m keen on trying to help people with – giving them the tools to deal with those situations”  being on the bench as a goalkeeper is a lonely place which few people understand “it is hard but i’m going to be on a bbc programme with guys who have real problems” hart points out  his last premier league game was on boxing day 2018 when burnley lost 51 at home to everton hart winces “i remember every second” he says before taking me through a painstaking recollection of the five goals “i spoke to sean dyche after he dropped me because i felt i’d had a strong season the results weren’t great but we were in transition going into europe we were trying to play more football and it didn’t really work  “he just said ‘look joe i think you’ve been fantastic but for the good of the team i need to try this one last change’ lo and behold tom heaton came in and did great the team picked up and went back to their old ways  “it’s been tough that’s no secret pure gametime is difficult because with the greatest respect to burnley they’re not a cup team staying in the premier league is all important it’s just not my time right now but i’m determined it will come again”  did he and guardiola also talk openly before city sent him on loan to torino “yeah i made sure we had dialogue i certainly backed myself to the hilt when we spoke i listened to what he had to say there’s more to it than me not being as good with my feet as he wants from a goalkeeper i realised he needed to make his stamp at city he had a direction he wanted to go and he’s not exactly struggled since has he”  hart laughs wryly had he been worried about his future as soon as guardiola was appointed “i was fairly concerned lots of important people tried to reassure me but you just have a feeling don’t you i came back late from the 2016 euros and he made it clear when i got there that i needed to be out by that window that’s pep’s brilliance he makes decisions and stands by them i don’t dislike him we get on as men and we both love football”  hart spent a season at torino and says “i enjoyed being part of that club in terms of being in a different country experiencing a different culture playing a different league i absolutely loved it it’s definitely something i’d love to do again” are there clubs looking to sign him next season “i believe there will be but they all need to work out exactly what the hell’s going on i like to think i’m a good catch i’m on a free contract i’ve got experience and real hunger the premier league has been great for me but i’m more than willing to spread my wings”  at the mention of serie a la liga or the bundesliga he says “i’m totally open i just want to play at the highest level i can in england i don’t feel i am going to be able to do that maybe if i hadn’t achieved what i’ve done in this league i might not be so ready to step away don’t get me wrong i’d love to have another big chance in england but it could be difficult”  facebook twitter pinterest hart shows his frustration after leroy sane scores for manchester city against burnley in october 2018 photograph manchester city fcmanchester city fc via getty images  ian woan burnley’s assistant manager tested positive for coronavirus last week but hart and his teammates are well “we’re back training and we’ve got another covid test tomorrow this will be the process until we can move forward”  how does hart feel about the return of the premier league “it’s a really interesting time we’re all involved in this onceinalifetime thing right now the most important thing is health and helping people that are putting their lives on the line as long as those guys are looked after then maybe we’ve got a chance of playing football”  during the lockdown his interest in psychology has been deepened by watching the last dance – about michael jordan and the chicago bulls “i am fascinated by human beings and elite sport i’ve been blown away by the jordan documentary what a beast what a man what a oneoff mindset it must have been painful to be that direct and aggressive every day he absolutely took it to a new level”  the fiver sign up and get our daily football email  hart has also been savouring the simple pleasures of life away from the bench while supporting prince william’s mental health campaign “for our mental health it’s so important to talk about the times we’re feeling good there are two sides to mental health obviously the dark depths are very important but you need to appreciate when you’re happy and savour the small little smiles the small little shivers  “one of the greatest things for me is to help people it can

and at its heart is a superstar who still retains his mystery  the last dance the wildly popular documentary series coproduced by espn and netflix about michael jordan and the 1990s chicago bulls dynasty concluded last week with the same delirious public reception it came in on – a reminder that jordan’s towering presence endures nearly two decades on from his playing days  the anticipation surrounding the ambitious 10part docuseries which was initially set to air in june on the off nights of this year’s nba finals had been growing since the release of a glossy extended trailer at christmas showing neverbeforeseen footage and a starstudded roster of interviewees replete with alist celebrities bill clinton and barack obama and a who’s who of basketball luminaries  yet it arrived at a moment as singular as the sportsman it profiles with the sports world at an unprecedented standstill amid the global coronavirus pandemic and millions of people desperate for the shared experience that the nba playoffs would otherwise be offering right now the episodes which aired in prime time on espn before their nextday release internationally on netflix became weekly appointment

commissioner david stern presents michael jordan and the chicago bulls the championship trophy after the bulls defeated the phoenix suns in game six of the 1993 nba finals photograph andrew d bernsteinnbae  the last dance ostensibly tells the story of jordan’s titular tumultuous final season with the bulls and his monomaniacal pursuit of excellence on the hardwood but the panoramic canvas allows for lengthy detours and richly drawn sidebars that never feel extraneous jordan’s own trajectory from babyfaced amateur to largerthanlife symbol to latterday myth is exhaustively retold through a stylish blend of archival footage presentday interviews and sparenoexpense soundtrack  lengthy segments are however devoted to the other principals in jordan’s orbit scottie pippen the famed wingman and lone constant aside from jordan on all six of chicago’s title teams dennis rodman the freespirited hardpartying rebounding machine phil jackson the hippiemystic head coach whose triangle offense helped unlock the team’s potential  but the star of the piece is jordan who after all these years remains both overexposed and mysterious at once the most prominent cultural reference point the united states has ever produced and something of a recluse who has spoken only sparingly about the bulls’ imperious reign and stillmystifying breakup at the height of their powers  “it’s maddening because i felt like we could have won seven i really believe that” jordan says “we may not have but man just not to be able to try that’s something that i just can’t accept”  before what proved to be the team’s last season together – a sixth and final championship run – jordan allowed the nba’s inhouse entertainment division to film what became more than 500 hours of behindthescenes footage of them with the condition that it could only be used with his explicit consent  facebook twitter pinterest president barack obama presents the presidential medal of freedom to michael jordan at the white house in 2016 photograph andrew harnikap  it does bear mentioning that jordan’s own production company is among the coproducers behind the project and he retained final cut and editorial control even while introducing the less pleasant elements of jordan’s legacy – his bullying and tyrannical proclivities with teammates and welldocumented gambling problem or as he puts it a competition problem – the warts are exposed in order to be smoothed over we are left with the unshakeable sensation that we are seeing jordan as he wants to be seen  but if history is written by the winners then jordan’s participation in his own hagiography is fair play especially if the alternative meant the unseen footage that comprises the narrative spine of the last dance would have remained locked away in the league’s new jersey vault no one won more or gave more of himself doing it – and not without the cost of personal relationships that is hinted at but is never far off  the very fact that jordan whose famously meticulous control of his likeness was years ahead of its time finally consented to a longform documentary seems improbable until you learn he gave the goahead only days after lebron james’s epochal comeback win over the golden state warriors in the 2016 nba finals which reignited the pancultural jordan v lebron debate in earnest  indeed jordan’s sheer charisma and force of personality as he dismissively lays waste to wouldbe rivals like gary payton clyde drexler and isiah thomas whose brand may never recover are enough to bury even the peskiest advertorial aftertaste watching this 57yearold man grapple with his legacy out loud whiskey in hand and weigh in on decadesold scores makes for compelling theatre – to say nothing of the countless memes it has spawned  facebook twitter pinterest michael jordan smiles at a press conference in chicago to announce his retirement in 1999 photograph sue ogrockireuters  jordan’s peerless oncourt performance is matched only by his business acumen which the last dance unpacks by way of his influence on urban culture and effective launch of what has become sneaker culture he earned a relatively modest 90m £74m in salary over the course of his 15year nba career – with about 63m coming in his final two seasons with the bulls – yet became the world’s first billionaire athlete by selectively aligning himself with brands like nike gatorade hanes mcdonald’s and upper deck he was ever conscious of the idea that his image became diluted the more it was used in a time when the titans of sports and entertainment routinely bypass traditional channels to control the narrative through their own production companies or friendly platforms jordan was years ahead of the game  the film does make gestures toward placing jordan’s legacy in a broader context relying on no less than a former president and fellow chicago icon for authority “there are great players who don’t have an impact beyond their sport” obama says “and then there are certain sports figures who become a larger cultural force michael jordan helped to create a different way in which people thought about the africanamerican athlete a different way in which people saw athletics as part of the entertainment business he became an extraordinary ambassador not just for basketball but for the united states overseas as part of the american culture sweeping the globe michael jordan and the bulls changed the culture”  but the last dance deftly resists the temptation to overreach and remains centred on jordan’s first and only concern the pursuit of perfection and wholesale domination of his rivals at a time when the games that bring us together have been put on indefinite hold it’s no surprise people flocked to the next best thing – even if they know how the

detroit musicians such as juan atkins who coined the term “techno” forty years later an array of electronic genres have been created from that blueprint schneider and kraftwerk created a feedback loop between germany and detroit that has existed for more than half a century  when schneider and ralf hütter started kraftwerk in 1970 their influences included several detroitbased acts including the stooges mc5 and according to later member karl bartos berry gordy’s motown label gordy initially worked for the ford motor plant and gave motown an industrialised music productionline inspired by

schneider and hütter out to experience nyc’s underground clubs in 1981 it was inevitable that their experiences in black and latino clubs would lead to the creation of music that fed straight back into those very communities  juan atkins was an avid listener to mojo’s show as with bambaataa’s iconic planet rock produced with arthur baker another kraftwerk fan atkins’ early work draws heavily on kraftwerk’s tropes and themes upon hearing their sequenced drum programming he immediately adopted the technique to mimic the group’s tight robotic rhythms as model 500 atkins used warped vocals and

something just flew into our eye  next week we’ll be at the final and god knows what that’ll bring it’s going to involve “virtual lipsyncing” “cutting edge technology” and more what this reunion episode showed us is that it’s very difficult to properly recreate things especially something as involved and physical as a drag show via the medium of video calls with lots of clever and probably painstaking editing the drag race team have made it watchable but the sad reality is that it was a poor imitation of the real thing  through no fault of anyone involved    here’s to a sparkling 12th

            "['341', 'ive never seen … jaws', 'j  aws is not a film about a shark i knew this before i watched it because every few months for the best part of two decades mark kermode has reminded me on his wittertainment radio show but not until i watched it did i understand the extent to which jaws is not a film about a shark and it would still elude me now had i not watched it when i watched it  you can’t come cold to jaws but everything you think know is irrelevant once the opening sequence is under way set in the ocean around amity island to john williams’ brilliant horrendous score it submerges the viewer with an oppressive helplessness that is intensely familiar death is imminent and all we can do is wait  tone established we cut to people on the beach enjoying joy they remind us that life is both precious and fragile because we know one of them will soon lose theirs in the course of simply going about their business  the stress is profound and all we can do is hope for the impossible – that the threat either fades away or swerves off course – until it doesn’t we see an end that is lonely protracted and savage but then see neither body nor grieving relatives so do not really feel loss the victim a statistic whose death does not speak to us we feel relieved that we had no relationship with her and guilt at that relief before life swiftly resumes  horror ahoy … roy scheider as brody photograph everett collectionrex features  but martin brody the police chief sees the corpse and fearing further tragedy shares his fears with the mayor – a tryhard blowhard who oozes smarm privilege and phoney eccentricity in the way of a man who has never had to take responsibility for his actions he responds with crass condescension prioritising profits over people – independence day is imminent – and glibness over substance jaws is not a film about a shark  so we return to the beach for our next horrendous death before which a woman wonders when she’ll become “an islander” “never” her councilwoman friend tells her “you’re not born here” the cost of this smug insular exceptionalism – this islander mentality – will soon be measured in blood  the vulnerability of the second victim a young boy is even more disquieting than the first and this time we see the mother who loves him when she returns shortly afterwards utterly bereft we can no longer ignore the reality that death is irreversible and everyone is someone’s something in desperation she slaps brody  naturally people are concerned so a town meeting is called brody is asked if he is going to close the beaches he says he is only to be overruled by the mayor whose power and privilege mean he still feels safe thus danger you can’t see is abetted by leadership you can see through jaws is not a film about a shark  the mayor’s problem is that ingrained within him is a disgust for detail and decency which is why he was surprised by an attack that was both predicted and planned for because he does not care for people not of his type he refuses to shock people who must be shocked by something shocking for fear of them being shocked while those whose job it is to understand the specifics – we might call them experts – become ever angrier  brody argues with the mayor murray hamilton as scientist matt hooper richard dreyfuss looks on photograph allstaruniversal  quickly those fearing something terrible happening are painted as unpatriotic stiffs bringing science to a pride fight as such though there’s a clear way to avoid aggravation – staying away from the water – people choose not to unwilling to compromise the freedom that helps them make sense of things believing itself to have conquered the world humanity is used to doing as it pleases so when that turns out not to be the case it responds with confused belligerence determined to show an oblivious opponent precisely who is boss jaws is not a film about a shark  the mayor’s desire to solve the problem lasts only until the cost becomes apparent he can’t bring himself to sensibly pay a professional putting himself in harm’s way for the cause so various chancers seize the chance to make a wedge killing any old shark and proclaiming an easy victory  those who know better insist to the contrary but his already unstoppable arrogance fortified the mayor encourages islanders to visit the beaches on the fourth of july even allowing his own kids to partake and then when people stay on the shore pressurises someone to lead them into the water a modernday comparison might be to imagine a disease that can be spread by shaking hands and an exhibitionist prime minister then shaking hands with those suffering from it at the same time as allowing huge sporting events to proceed and evoking war as an everlasting deposit into a national wankbank able to cure every ill  meanwhile sensible people grow increasingly despondent at the preventable horror soon to be visited on unsuspecting patsies the constant dread is of who will be next – when will someone we know die – until finally we see the hideous threat with our own eyes the reality though is that its effect – a severed limb – is far more traumatic likewise the suffering visited on the children proximate to it jaws is not a film about a shark  now the mayor has no choice but to act his realisation fired by his personal proximity to disaster consequently the experience does not change him he stumps up money for the hunt but his performance reveals the incompetent invertebrate we already knew him to be  so three men set off to kill the shark – the bounty hunter the scientist and brody – and before they do we see how worried brody’s wife is previously she had assuaged her feelings with sex and drink but now the peril is directly upon her she cannot which is to say that everyone thinks they understand it until they understand it  out at sea booze singing and camaraderie soon give way to squalor rancour and claustrophobia people trapped against their will with death marauding somewhere outside eventually though they neutralise the killer in a scene of ecstatic triumphant relief and victims forgotten we assume that amity immediately reverts to the vacuity that underpinned its catastrophe to begin with yeah jaws really is not a film about a shark']\n",

isolation can stop some people creating  new zealand band the beths are getting ready to release their second album in june it’s kind of a weird time to do it “it’s pretty strange it feels a bit like releasing out into the void” says vocalist elizabeth stokes “in the old reality we would have been touring right now”  album releases and tours normally go hand in hand with good reason – musicians make the bulk of their income from live shows and just a trickle from music sales or streaming with gigs and festivals unlikely to return any time soon most artists who were far enough out to pump the brakes are delaying their albums until 2021  but those who are pushing on with release plans face another logistical hurdle how the hell do you make a music video when you’ve got to stay 15 metres apart from everyone else  with big crews backup dancers makeup artists and most public locations off the table here are seven that are improvising  1 the beths – i’m not getting excited  the beths initially had a very different plan for the video for this single but when the country went into lockdown the week they were due to film they were forced to throw it out and come up with an entirely new concept  powderfinger paul kelly adam liaw and more the best live streams for australia and beyond read more  their directors a duo called sports team sent each band member instructions for how to photograph themselves and then used stop motion animation to bring the shots to life “we all filmed in our respective homes as we couldn’t see each other the directors sent us briefs of the shots we had to do and how to set them up and where in each of our houses we would do our parts we’d send them pictures of the framing they’d give us feedback until it was right and then we’d shoot with help from people within our ‘bubbles’” says stokes  “we wanted to make it seem like it was all within one nightmarey house so we’re all in a different room of this imaginary house”  2 justin bieber and ariana grande – stuck with u  pop superstars justin bieber and ariana grande were brought together by their shared manager scooter braun to record a love song custommade for the pandemic stuck with u is reportedly the first of a string of charity singles the duo will record together in 2020 proceeds from the song benefit the first responders children’s foundation  their medium of choice for the music video was the humble iphone the video took the artists’ own homefilmed footage – that’s jb and his wife hayley baldwin lounging in bed and slow dancing around the kitchen – and collaged it with videos sent in by housebound fans and their loved ones partners dogs bottles of wine whatever there are also blinkandyou’llmissthem cameos from celebs including kendall and kylie jenner gwyneth paltrow and jaden smith  3 washington – dark parts  australian artist megan washington actually began using apps and youtube tutorials to learn how to animate before the pandemic the new hobby came in handy when it came time to make a video for her single dark parts – which she animated herself  “i only started the dark parts animation in late march pretty much the second week of australian lockdown we had a music video that we were planning to make before lockdown but it fell through because we couldn’t get the location we wanted so while we were figuring out what to do next i just started drawing” washington says  isolation proved to have a small silver lining “i’d say that iso forced me to go deeper into my creativity in all senses this video was just meant to be a sevensecond looping thing to play on spotify but i just had all this time so i kept going and going and then one day many many weeks later it was finished” she said “i now understand why framebyframe animation is so unpopular it takes forever”  4 charli xcx – claws  charli xcx has to have been one of the most productive people on earth during the pandemic in early april the boundarypushing pop star announced

finished writing this single so the concept for the video was devised with covid restrictions in mind the clip was filmed around the barren expanses of lake george on the outskirts of canberra

the democratic nominee with key groups and drive voter registration  former president barack obama has dipped his toes into the 2020 presidential campaign recently and is positioned to do more in the coming months as joe biden’s effort to defeat donald trump gathers steam  interviews with about a dozen democratic strategists officials and people close to obama indicated members of the party want the popular former president to use his powerful online presence and focus on rallying key democrat constituencies that are critical to a biden victory  obama is regarded as one of the most popular figures in american politics and a huge asset within the democratic party he left the white house with a near60 approval rating his endorsement for any candidate is the political campaign equivalent of an oilman and hitting a gusher  obama would be most effective interviewees said in highlighting his former vicepresident’s résumé rallying key democratic groups like african american women and pushing voters to register  the situation is unique there hasn’t been a popular former twoterm president eager to hit the trail for his former running mate for years on top of that the coronavirus pandemic limits inperson campaigning and rallies still the strategists interviewed say obama is valuable and should be used everywhere  “you rarely have a former president that is more popular than the nowsortofnominee” democratic pollster cornell belcher said “barack obama is the most popular political figure in america right now”  facebook twitter pinterest joe biden and barack obama before a presidential primary debate in 2007 photograph jim youngreuters  valerie jarrett who served as a senior adviser to obama during his time in the white house said obama is “committed to helping vicepresident biden in any way the biden campaign thinks is helpful the pandemic is forcing everyone to be more creative since the conventional ways of doing business including campaigning are not possible”  obama has a robust social media presence with millions of twitter followers and jarrett pointed to obama’s endorsement of biden which took the form of an online video now that campaign rallies have become a thing of the prepandemic past  “i think you can tell from the video that he rolled out with his endorsement one very useful platform is president obama’s social media platform where he has more followers than any other politician by far”  according to a democratic strategist familiar with obama’s thinking the former president is eager to campaign for democrats “up and down the ballot” in 2020 he plans to follow the lead of the biden campaign as well as that of the main democratic campaign arms – the democratic congressional campaign committee the democratic senatorial campaign committee and other umbrella organizations  obama was an active surrogate to boost democrats in the 2018 midterm elections but since then has taken a more restrained approach to the national spotlight he has only waded into current politics a few times and mostly on an indirect basis  most recently though he delivered a commencement speech for college graduates where he said the coronavirus pandemic had “finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing” obama didn’t mention trump by name but the speech was widely regarded as a direct allusion to the president it could also herald what obama’s public appearances in the final months of the 2020 presidential campaign would be like  separately during a closed event with thousands of supporters and obama alumni the former president warned that the justice department’s decision to drop charges against the former trump administration national security adviser michael flynn put the rule of law at risk  campaign veterans and strategists say obama is useful less as an attack dog going head to head with trump and more as someone who highlights a positive vision of why voters should elect biden  facebook twitter pinterest president obama endorses joe biden via online video link photograph brian cahnzuma wirerexshutterstock  “to me obama is the world’s best character witness” said teddy goff who was digital director for obama’s second presidential campaign “yeah he can make the case that trump is bad he can certainly validate the case for biden’s policies but essentially he’s the most popular political figure on planet earth and the one guy he entrusted with the single most important appointment of his life was joe biden”  but obama could also persuade more people to vote  meg ansara who was national regional director for obama’s first presidential campaign and more recently battleground states director for hillary clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign said one of the key priorities especially in this environment is voter registration  “i think voter registration is a huge place” ansara said adding that persuading undecided voters is important for someone like obama as well “i’m a big believer that you need to do both in the bulk of these battleground states”  there have been moments during the last three years when democrats had wondered why obama didn’t speak out more against trump or weigh in more during the democratic primary that’s actually an asset now and adds weight to when obama does speak out said guy cecil who runs the priorities usa super pac  “i think in some respects the biden campaign benefits from the fact that obama has not spent three and a half years in the political limelight attacking the president attacking the administration engaging in a backandforth with trump” cecil said  corey platt a veteran democratic strategist and campaign manager said that obama and biden have done a good job of appearing together so far and he should keep doing that rather than just focusing on going headtohead with trump  “i think he if continues to remind people about competency and progress under his administration it will make people feel good about biden change and sanity if he engages trump i think that could backfire” platt said “he can help articulate biden’s vision for what happens next year

nostalgia for the presidency of barack obama but now as he faces the general election amid the deepening economic turmoil the presumptive democratic nominee is reaching for the legacy of a radical american president franklin delano roosevelt  “the blinders have been taken off” biden told supporters recently during a virtual fundraiser from his delaware home where he has been since march “because of this covid crisis i think people are realizing ‘my lord look at what is possible look at the institutional changes we can make’”  in recent weeks biden who has climbed above trump in national polls has openly courted progressive leaders and ideas adopting some of the populist rhetoric more commonly associated with his vanquished rivals bernie sanders and elizabeth warren in turn they have offered their fullthroated endorsements casting biden a pragmatic dealmaker who still believes in bipartisan comity as the perhaps unlikely herald of a new progressive era  “a shift of frame matters – it’s not to be underestimated” the california congressman ro khanna who was a cochair of sanders’ presidential campaign said of biden’s bold messaging “it’s a totally different vision for what he thinks the next four years should be about”  neither biden nor trump has yet laid out their vision for what the first 100 days of a new presidency might look like a benchmark established by

imagined during daily virtual meetings biden and his team are beginning to draft a new governing vision that reflects the scale and urgency of the crisis that biden predicted may “eclipse what fdr faced”  the task is not entirely new to biden as vicepresident he led the obama administration’s response to the recession and his campaign hopes to leverage his remarkably scandalfree stewardship of the nearly 800bn stimulus package with trump’s handling of the economy  in the coming weeks biden said he would share a detailed plan “for the right kind of economic recovery” aspects of which are expected to include massive investment in public health expansive legislative action on climate change and broad new protections for workers  last week biden announced six policy taskforces – centered around issues that include healthcare climate and the economy – that pair his supporters with ideological allies of sanders among those chosen to participate are some of the young progressive leaders most skeptical of his approach including the new york congresswoman alexandria ocasiocortez  in a joint press release announcing the taskforces biden said the groups would help “transform our country”  “vicepresident biden understands in his gut that this is a totally different order of magnitude than any president has ever dealt with” said mary kay henry president of the service employees international union and a member of the healthcare taskforce  henry said the coronavirus has exposed the underlying causes of the us’s problems calling public attention to issues she believes government and business leaders can no longer afford to ignore  “we had 38 million people that have lost jobs but that’s on top of the 64 million americans who already made less than 15 an hour before covid” she said without paid sick leave some essential workers are reporting for work even if they feel ill because they can’t afford the alternative while fastfood and healthcare workers stage protests to demand protective equipment  “that level of inequality has sort of hit people between the eyes”  jared bernstein one of biden’s economic advisers said biden was looking beyond the “cyclical” challenges posed by the pandemic to the many “structural” problems it has revealed  “biden is i think developing a particularly robust agenda that really strikes at this reality that the trump economy was built on a house of sand and has turned out to be totally nonresilient to any shock” said bernstein who advised biden during his tenure as vicepresident  biden bernstein said recognizes the need for an “urgent expansion” that better insulates the american economy from the “shocks that are coming fast and furiously” not as a direct result of the pandemic but from climate change and income inequality  biden has also made other gestures he has adopted aspects of sanders’ free college tuition proposal he has embraced elizabeth warren’s bankruptcy proposal and joined with the senator viewed as a potential running mate to call for better oversight of how the trump administration spends the coronavirus relief fund  critics on the left have scoffed at the notion of biden as an fdrstyle visionary after all they say biden once told supporters that under his presidency “nothing would fundamentally change”  david sirota a former adviser to sanders 2020 presidential campaign dismissed biden’s overtures to the left as performative politics – a “canned snl skit” that progressives were being asked to accept as “something real”  \\ufeffrepublicans meanwhile view biden’s expanding policy aspirations as a political gift after the taskforce members were announced the republican national committee tagged biden a “bannerman for the socialist agenda”  biden’s policy platform – which includes a public option for healthcare and an aggressive plan to combat the climate crisis – might have been considered farreaching in another presidential cycle but during the primary he resisted pressure from activists to embrace progressive litmustest items such as medicare for all and a green new deal  campaign aides and allies say biden’s calls for change are part of a policy evolution in response to the crisis not a sudden embrace of a sandersstyle agenda biden himself has pointed to his nearly 50year political career as a guide for how he would make “institutional” changes “without us becoming a socialist country or any of that malarkey”  michael gwin a spokesman for biden’s campaign said “he’s scaling up the solutions he’s proposed so that we can meet this moment get through this crisis and ensure that we come out on the other end with a stronger middle class and a more resilient country”  surrounding his planning for the presidency is the uncertainty over who will control the house and senate which is suddenly within reach for democrats yet there are signs that the coronavirus and trump’s handling of the crisis have scrambled the political calculus giving biden new latitude to move in a far bolder direction  a recent survey by the nonpartisan pew research center found that the public’s view of the economy has darkened dramatically just 23 of americans describe the economic outlook as “excellent” or “good” down from 57 at the start of the year the same poll found overwhelming support for the 2tn coronavirus relief measure passed by congress last month a marked contrast from the polarized partisan views of the stimulus package passed to stem the economic fallout from the great recession  “i can’t underscore

the nobel prize  but at the same time he is clearly thrilled by the destructive power that the us arsenal gives him boasting about the size of his nuclear button and a mystery “super duper” missile he

financing at the us treasury and was nominated last year to the top human rights job at the state department – but that foundered amid controversy over his involvement in the post 911 torture programme  the arms control envoy job did not require senate confirmation  in his maiden speech as envoy billingslea made clear that if there were to be a new arms race the us would win  “we know how to win these races and we know how to spend the adversary into oblivion” he said in a videoconference organised by the conservative hudson institute thinktank on thursday it was a statement of bravado as the us plunged into recession owing about 7tn in foreign debt 1tn to china  billingslea argued trump would succeed through his mastery of the art of the deal  “the president has a long and successful career as a negotiator and he’s a master at developing and using leverage” he said showing an early instinct for what it takes to keep your job in this administration  so far however trump

of options related to that treaty” billingslea said at the same time he made clear he viewed new start as being inadequate criticising its verification requirements its exclusion of nonstrategic shorterrange weapons – and most importantly the fact that it does not include china  the trump administration’s arms control policy has been stuck for nearly three years on its insistence that china be involved in any new treaty beijing has so far refused to be drawn into negotiations which it believes are the responsibility of the us and russia who together possess more than 90 of the world’s stockpile of nearly 14000 warheads the federation of american scientists estimates china has 320 warheads which are stockpiled not deployed  “the administration continues to stall” the democratic senator chris van hollen told the guardian “the best way to describe their position is that it’s under review and the problem of course is this has been under review for a very long time now and the clock is ticking”  by the accounts of those who have worked for him on the issue the president remains convinced that he can somehow work out a deal if he was able to speak facetoface with vladimir putin and xi jinping  it is a longheld belief in the 1980s he claimed he could bring the cold war to an end if he was given an hour alone with mikhail gorbachev  once installed in office himself he regaled aides with tales of what he might have achieved with the soviet union’s last leader  “he would sometimes claim to have met with gorbachev or had been going to meet with him – all with this

opening his eyes to the everimminent threat of nuclear weapons  trump has brought up the subject unprompted in discussions with foreign leaders such as with the former uk prime minister theresa may during a state visit to london in june 2019  “he told may the number one existential threat is still nuclear weapons and not climate change or any of these other issues that all these other people were raising” said a former official  us officials first raised the idea of including china in new start with their russian counterparts at talks held in helsinki in september 2017 but the russians showed little enthusiasm  when the proposal was put directly to chinese officials they rejected it outright  “i raised it when we were in new york i raised it when we were in beijing and raised it at every opportunity but we got no traction” said andrea thompson former undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs “they were not interested in having a discussion”  in the face of such adamant refusal there was no agreed plan within the administration on how to proceed  arms control advocates in the administration believe that the insistence on china’s inclusion was originally pushed by trump’s third national security adviser john bolton a lifelong opponent of arms control treaties and his likeminded aide tim morrison as a means of killing off new start  morrison adamantly denies the “poison pill” accusation and insists that the president fully supported the position that arms control was meaningless without china  “he believes that arms control does not currently reflect the threats that exist” he told the guardian “if arms control is important you can’t not include china … do we wait to include them in arms control until they get 800 nuclear weapons … why would we continue to wait to include them in arms control it’s silly”  morrison attributed the failure to make progress on the absence of a chief negotiator – which he blamed on deliberate bureaucratic inertia  “the president needs to understand that there are those around him who would be happy to see him run out of time to get a bigger agreement and put him in a binary position of either to extend or not extend new start” he said  us arms control office critically understaffed under trump experts say read more  disarmament advocates worry that even if billingslea reestablishes regular contacts with moscow the us no longer has the diplomatic muscle to pursue substantive complex arms negotiations because of the steady loss of experienced staff responsible for such negotiations  “it’s not obvious they have a kind of a serious team in place to try and make that happen” a western diplomat said  “three years after entering office the trump administration lacks a coherent set of goals a strategy to achieve them or the personnel or effective policy process to address the most complex set of nuclear risks in us history” a group of arms control experts wrote in a

hawaii has had some of the lowest rates of covid19 in the us  but the quarantine essentially halted tourism in hawaii which accounts for a quarter of the economy as a result nearly onethird of the state’s working population has applied for unemployment  its beyond frustrating tensions peak as hawaii locals urge tourists to stay out read more  this week hawaii’s governor david ige announced a phased approach to opening the nontourism economy or kamaʻaina local economy the plan reopened auto dealerships car washes and pet grooming services in may while waiting until june to consider reopening higherrisk businesses such as gyms museums and theaters  the governor also confirmed that the mandatory 14day quarantine for all arrivals would stay in place through june the finer details of how the tourism economy – bars hotels convention centers – will be reopened have yet to be released but one idea being discussed is waiving the quarantine for visitors if they take a covid19 test before traveling to hawaii  “the state needs to bring back tourism in some way we need money” said colin moore the university of hawaii public policy director “but the only way to make that work is to find a way to do it as safely as we can”  facebook twitter pinterest hawaii’s governor david ige at the state capitol in january photograph audrey mcavoyap  nearly 240000 people have signed up for unemployment since the beginning of march according to hawaii’s department of labor and industrial relations the pandemic unemployment assistance program which opened in may for gig workers and selfemployed individuals has received 28000 applications the state’s outdated unemployment system created a huge backlog in applications forcing the recently jobless to wait weeks or for some more than a month for their first payments  the governor has extended the quarantine until the end of june which has helped bring the number of arrivals to hawaii from the usual 30000 to less than 1000 most days the mandatory 14day quarantine requires that everyone arriving in the state or traveling between islands must go directly from the airport to their home or hotel during the quarantine period all food must be delivered those who break quarantine face a maximum fine of 5000 andor imprisonment of up to one year  local lawmakers have budgeted 36m for airport temperature cameras which the governor said at a press conference on monday would be part of the future screening process for arrivals to hawaii’s airports “it does allow us to identify those who are most sick in a way that can be less intrusive than other screening methods” ige said the white house has advocated for their use although the centers for disease control and prevention has said that thermal screening airport passengers is not a particularly effective detection strategy  “it’s a lot of money to set up a system that makes people feel better but actually doesn’t catch many of the active cases that are coming in” said sumner la croix a research fellow at the university of hawaii’s economic research organization  facebook twitter pinterest a man walks along a closed pier on waikiki beach in honolulu in late march photograph caleb jonesap  instead he said people should take a test before flying to hawaii and individuals who share their negative results with the state could then have the 14day quarantine waived this system won’t be flawless since test results are not always accurate and not everyone will do it he also acknowledged that people flying to hawaii might still be exposed to the virus while traveling  but it would stop the vast majority of asymptomatic people who would have flown into the state with covid19 making it relatively easy to keep the number of new cases low hawaii’s lieutenant governor josh green the us congressman ed case and local lawmakers have expressed support for a screening strategy that includes pretesting for the coronavirus while the federal aviation administration and the us department of transportation have said that would be possible  ‘i can’t get any help’ disney world staff go weeks without unemployment benefits read more  “we’re going to have to deal with outbreaks but that shouldn’t be our main policy” said la croix “our main policy should be trying to prevent people who have active coronavirus infections from getting on planes”  maintaining low rates of covid19 will probably encourage visitors to come to the state as they will think of hawaii as a safe place it will also make residents who are weary of visitors – a handful were caught breaking quarantine after posting pictures of themselves on the beach – more confident about allowing tourism to return  testing contact tracing and isolation methods also needed to be bolstered before the state allowed tourists to come back said la croix in early may the state’s department of health said it was increasing the number of trained contact tracers who will help track the people an infected person may have come in contact with in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus  even after the quarantine is lifted it could be years until the tourism economy returns to its previous figures in 2019 hawaii received a recordbreaking 10 million tourists if the recovery of hawaii’s tourism economy continues to drag the doubledigit unemployment rates could remain for years too  facebook twitter pinterest the international airport in honolulu seen in april coronavirus has essentially halted tourism in hawaii photograph caleb jonesap  the existing idea that hawaii is overly reliant on tourism and the need to diversify the economy has picked up steam since the pandemic began  “we can retrain people to start attracting a more diverse set of industries” said moore he said the governor should create retraining opportunities for people in the hospitality sector who have lost their jobs statesponsored jobs that would focus on public works projects and programs for young people “people need a sense of purpose being unemployed for a long time your skills start to rot it can lead to depression” he said  along with longlasting high unemployment numbers many hawaii residents will be forced to move to the us mainland for opportunities and affordable housing it will probably take hawaii longer to recover than states on the mainland with more diversified economies said moore hawaii has already seen a loss of population for the past three years and the pandemic is likely to accelerate that trend  “you’re going to lose the people you really don’t want to lose” said moore about residents moving away from hawaii “welltrained younger people with families who could be the future of the state leaving we’re going to lose some of the most valuable people this

effort to shore up support following guardian revelations that cummings was spotted at a teesside town more than 20 miles from his parents’ home in durham  one backbencher said the calls were a “desperate measure” to garner the support of mps to save the job of the special adviser  in an article for the critic magazine the former minister steve baker said the architect of the vote leave campaign should stand aside after travelling hundreds of miles with his son and wife who had coronavirus symptoms and then travelling to a nearby town  “dominic cummings must go before he does any more harm to the uk the government the prime minister our institutions or the conservative party” baker wrote of his fellow brexiter  “today’s newspapers are a disaster enormous political capital is being expended saving someone who has boasted of making decisions beyond his competence and who clearly broke at the very least the guidance which kept mums and dads at home without childcare from their parents and instead risked spreading the virus by travelling  “it is intolerable that boris boris’s government and boris’s programme should be harmed in this way” he wrote  baker’s comments

arrogance that was apparent when he ran the vote leave campaign  “as far as i am aware among those who work with rather than for him only michael gove enjoys dom’s respect  “so it is hardly surprising when mums and dads were going without the childcare provided by their parents – perhaps while they were isolating for seven and 14 days with covid19 symptoms – that dominic was suiting himself with a long drive presumably with stops to get help during his illness” baker wrote  baker has been joined by simon hoare the senior tory mp from the centre of the party and chair of the northern ireland

worse than unqualified” brazil was witnessing “the empowerment of stupidity and ignorance”  oliveira said she had been repulsed at bolsonaro’s “egocentric shallow and offensive” show “what you see is a government that isn’t in the slightest bit engaged with the most pressing issue not just for the country but for the whole planet” was it any wonder brazil had been “plunged into this spiral of death illness inefficiency and incompetence” when this was the group in charge  but one thing had come as a relief to oliveira who is one of brazil’s leading black voices bolsonaro’s allwhite and

faced calls to resign from across the political spectrum the government was forced to defend his actions  ministers insisted he had stayed put once arriving at a property in durham where he had travelled after contracting the symptoms of coronavirus to seek the support from his extended family  but the new claims would appear to demolish this defence and intensify questions over his claim

predate the nearby unesco world heritage site  a faded decadesold blackandwhite photograph was the only lead johny isla had when he set out on the trail of a sea monster  the peruvian archaeologist spotted the image at a 2014 exhibition in germany about the nazca lines the vast and intricate desert images which attract tens of thousands of tourists every year  the photograph taken in the early 1970s showed a mysterious killer whale deity carved in an arid hillside the figure bore some resemblance to others he knew but he had never seen this one before  isla now peru’s chief archaeologist for the lines spent hours poring through archives before returning to peru – armed with a drone and a lifetime of local field experience – to find it  after several false starts it took just two weeks to find the 25by65metre image which had been hiding in plain sight in the hills of palpa about 30 miles north of nazca in a huge expanse of desert in southern peru  the design carved into the hillside depicts a terrifying mythological beast part orca but with a human arm holding a trophy head and several more heads inside its body  new research with drones has helped uncover hundreds of such figures carved in the desert near the lines in nazca but which predate them by as much as 1500 years the archaeologists leading the effort now believe that the anthropomorphic orca figure fills in a missing link between hundreds of older geoglyphs and the nazca culture’s desert etchings  the smaller forms were etched on hillsides in nearby palpa by the paracas and topará cultures between 500bc and ad200  “this orca was made at a time of abundance and population growth in a moment of change from one society to another” said isla  facebook twitter pinterest the figure known as ‘la orca de piedras gordas’ or the orca which was rediscovered by johny isla in palpa photograph jorge de la quintanathe guardian  isla believe that the topará crafted the orca figure during a period of dynamic transition “the nazca lines are the culmination of a process of experimentation and improvement in technique which follow on from these older geoglyphs” said isla  dating from ad200700 the lines were given unesco world heritage status in 1994  ancient peruvian nazca turned land to desert read more  more than a thousand of them – vast geometric patterns and zoomorphic figures such as the monkey the hummingbird and the whale – stretch across more than 400 sq km of the nazca plateau they were created by removing the top layer of pebbles to reveal the lightercoloured material beneath  the newly discovered geoglyphs’ location on hillsides however marks a key difference said luis jaime castillo a peruvian archaeologist working on the nazcapalpa project with isla  “placing these geoglyphs on the slopes means that in contrast with the nazca lines you can see them if you are standing in the valley below where life and agriculture is taking place” he said  “if the nazca lines were made by humans for the gods these figures were made by humans for humans” explained castillo a former minister of culture for peru “they are clearly representations of identifiable people they are demarcating territories”  by contrast the larger and more sophisticated geoglyphs further south in nazca can not be viewed completely from the ground  according to isla the latest research indicates the nazca lines were “made with the purpose of asking the gods for water and fertility in this desert area”  but archaeologists are still trying to understand the transition between the paracas culture’s depiction of largely human figures intended to be viewed by other people to the nazca iconography in which humans are all but absent  as the society grew larger the images may have been appropriated by the elite and given a sacred status castillo believes it was a transition from drawings made by households or villages to grand designs made by an organisation closer to a state he argues  on one hillside a warrior wearing a headdress and carrying a staff or spear stands close to a female figure between them is a mythological creature with a mass of tentacles or snakes the figures are believed to symbolise fertility  from the ground the designs are now hard to see but the drone’s eagleeye reveals the full design on a monitor viewed by castillo who has long promoted aerial mapping techniques to register peru’s estimated 100000 archaeological sites of which only a fraction have been excavated  facebook twitter pinterest the panamerican highway cuts through the nazca lines which are some 450km south of lima the capital of peru photograph jorge de la quintanathe guardian  drones are being used not just to find geoglyphs but to “cover kilometres and kilometres and take thousands and thousands of pictures which are then processed in very large computers” castillo said “the images are so detailed that we can see a stone half an inch across”  the result of the process known as photogrammetry is highly detailed threedimensional mapping of large areas which in the case of the nazca and palpa lines is a huge boost for their protection  greenpeace apologises to people of peru over nazca lines stunt read more  the funding to discover these new geoglyphs came ironically as a result of an international scandal when greenpeace activists left damaging footprints next to the famous hummingbird during a publicity stunt aimed at the 2014 un climate change summit in lima  outrage over the incident prompted the us to give peru a grant which helped fund isla and his team  registering and georeferencing the geoglyphs is the best way to protect them from the spread of agriculture or urban encroachment castillo says but just a few of the sites will be made known to the public so as not to make them a target for vandalism many of the hillsides cut through by the panamerican highway are already covered with modernday etchings ranging from brands of fertilizer to graffiti tags  castillo believes that in the nazca and palpa area – already described by unesco as having the “most outstanding group of geoglyphs anywhere in the world” – new discoveries may yet outnumber older ones  while the team have discovered hundreds of geoglyphs in palpa castillo expects to find many more “we’ve registered maybe just 5 of what there is” he says']\n",

significant challenges in their lives including those excluded from school and involved in antisocial behaviour – almost always as a result of mental health issues with a unique programme of support efc provides an invaluable resource to more than 4000 people each year in one of the uk’s most deprived areas it offers young people who would probably not access traditional forms of therapy a variety of bespoke services designed to support complicated home lives blighted by poverty deprivation and inadequate housing  “we are a charity that uses boxing noncontact boxing and boxing training as a hook to leverage the street credibility of the sport to knock down some of the barriers to entry for some of society’s most difficult to reach young people” says efc alongside that it offers intensive personal development psychological support therapy and advice on careers and education  “young people arrive at our doors with a range of behavioural and emotional issues including anger anxiety depression and low selfesteem” says bisp “their distress is often expressed in ways that can lead them into trouble rather than care and support” young people are referred to efc by schools

situations they have been involved in we have not yet met young people who have any desire to be mentally unwell what happens is that their behaviour can manifest itself in certain ways what we’ve found is that if you look at the symptom of anger or criminal behaviour there are always underlying core problems it may be chaotic home lives it may be substance abuse by the parents it could be domestic abuse it could be sexual abuse there is a whole series of factors that can lead into a behaviour that becomes symptomatic which then gets a young person labelled” through its unique package

child and adolescent mental health services can be six months the hoops that a young person has to go through – visiting the gp getting a referral to camhs making that appointment filling out the forms … that is challenging enough if you’ve got two parents in a middleclass family but when you’ve probably not got the support the barriers to entry for that service are too challenging and too

for a young person who is not confident and comfortable enough in themselves to sit in a room with somebody they barely know and start talking about their problems”  this is the sort of place where you don’t even realise you are being cured but you are prince harry  visiting the gym in 2019 prince harry said “the thought of sitting down in a chair one to one with a therapist can be a real deterrent however this is the sort of place where you don’t even realise you are being cured but you are”  “a lot of these kids have gone through so much it might be physical or sexual abuse it could be anything – and they are angry” bisp says “rather than try and tell people they shouldn’t feel angry actually what we start talking about is that anger is perfectly normal anger is a manifestation of issues and they are issues they have a right to be angry about so what we’re teaching them is how to react and how to deal with those situations in a way that’s constructive”  bisp who developed the programme along with sanigar and a team of sports psychologists says that “the metaphor they have built through the boxing relates back to the young person’s individual life and that’s what the psychology is trying to do that minigoal might be ‘don’t get thrown out of school monday’ ‘don’t take drugs tuesday’ the psychology is about how it relates to the boxing but really it’s about how it relates to life” through positive affirmation and the strong relationship built through the sport the coaches are then able to use that relationship to offer support outside of the gym “i can’t just come in here and start talking to them but we use boxing as a tool to engage them and that’s when we bring in our development points” says ako a coach at efc  the former ibf featherweight world champion lee selby is a mentor at the club “i try and get into them that i’ve worked my way up” he says “it’s not just sports that that works in it’s general life if you work hard you can achieve your goals and your dreams” the influence of somebody such as selby on marginalised young people – many of whom will have grown up watching and hearing of his achievements – can be dramatic “they know i am from the same sort of background and they can relate to me” he says “at school they are being told what to do by some posh guy and they are not really interested”  they know i am from the same sort of background and they can relate to me lee selby former featherweight world champion  for many of the young people a supportive nurturing relationship with an adult can be a new experience sarah foster mother of april 16 describes how april’s relationship with her coach courtney “has grown to the point where courtney is a trusted adult that has been a rare thing for her in her life in her experience it’s really important”  this type of relationship at efc is built and maintained over a 20week programme that combines noncontact boxing with mentoring and psychological education the coaches believe that boxing being largely individual and broken into threeminute rounds allows a unique opportunity for therapy and mentoring  “the way that boxing is broken down into rounds means you’ve got opportunities to build relationships and to talk while they are doing the activity” says sanigar “they can be skipping and you can be having a conversation they can stop for a minute you can have a conversation you can’t do that in football you have your own individual goal set by a coach and your goal might be to get five skips we build small minigoals for young people to achieve”  ellie 15 was referred to efc by her therapist “i had a really bad home growing up” she says “i never had space where i could just go to relax it was always tension tension tension i struggle with really bad anger issues they have calmed down a lot so much since being here even after the first session you could see the difference i’d keep everything in and wouldn’t let anything out they really taught me how to open up about how i’m feeling it’s definitely made a difference in every aspect of my life”  nina who has ptsd depression and social anxiety says empire has made her “less anxious about being in groups and being with new people” she adds “i just feel comfortable being able to come back even if i don’t have to do the sessions i can speak to someone it doesn’t necessarily even have to be about what’s going on it can just be about anything which helps and it’s a nice distraction from everything else”  dontae 17 was referred to the gym after being excluded from school a number of times he is now at college studying health and fitness and says “i started coming in more and more regularly i started loving it and my confidence grew more and more knowing how i feel and telling them how i feel and them listening to how i feel it’s helped me to calm down they are basically like mentors to me my mental health has got better my mental health was just about anger anger anger now it isn’t i feel better i feel more normal i feel more awareness mentally stronger knowing what decisions can benefit me”  one issue that efc regularly identifies in young people is low selfesteem and sense of selfworth “the level of extremity has drastically changed over recent years” says sanigar “this is inner city an area of deprivation that is going through a bit of a funny change at the moment a threebed house will cost you over £300000 if you are growing up in this area with nothing – no role models no mentors – it’s practically impossible now for you to get on the property ladder youth services have been closed there is nothing for them and they are becoming more isolated sitting in their bedrooms they are living a fantasy life on their phones where it’s instagram snapchat – all these wonderful lives out there they are suddenly looking at their lives and it is destroying their selfesteem”  once a young person has been supported psychologically efc looks to address some of the issues which have a detrimental effect on a young person’s wellbeing and selfesteem such as unemployment its careers service sees 90 of users find employment training or higher education  sanigar says “it’s inspiring young people to understand the opportunities that are out there which they often won’t get to see with careers we look at what inspires you what is it that gets you excited if it’s football the likelihood is you’re not going to be a premier league footballer but we will take you up to a local football club there are 80 different trades there from the marketing department to the stadium manager to the groundsman these are all careers in football at one level or another it may still involve them getting a shift at tesco or ikea to work their way along that ladder but there is an ultimate goal for us it’s about making the underlying lasting changes to a person’s life”  one of the employment schemes efc runs is with local coffee roasters extract coffee who offer a barista training programme steven 20 found employment after completing the course “i wouldn’t have got the job at boston tea party without empire giving me that push when i started coming to empire i wasn’t in a great place but now everything has changed after doing boxing sessions day by day my mood generally got a lot better i feel happier i don’t have those days when i don’t feel like doing anything because i don’t have the selfesteem or the energy i’m actively looking to do stuff compared to where i first started that’s quite a big leap”  efc has also trained qualified therapists in noncontact boxing skills in order to provide support to young people with some of the most severe mental health issues  “the demographic we have here is very varied” says therapist jane ivall “often they will be some of the hardesttoreach young people the fact they are engaging and connecting here is a good starting point for them engaging and connecting with us here there is a whole range of people with a whole range of issues and we just come alongside them using the medium of boxing to enable them to access mental health support the boxing breaks down the barriers to traditional therapy it enables people to open up and access things they traditionally may not feel comfortable to access talking about a trauma is complex working physically enables you to shift trauma to explore things and to build a rapport and trust with a therapist quicker”  rather than try and tell people they shouldn’t feel angry what we start talking about is that anger is perfectly normal martin bisp efc founder  for many who come to efc boxing has a unique appeal that alleviates any stigma that may come with accessing more traditional mental health or careers services sanigar points to the “credibility and grit” about what efc does “boxers and boxing gyms are respected within these communities i would say that in any deprived community in the world there is a boxing gym young people are not embarrassed to come they can be in here doing a cv doing homework having a onetoone session with a therapist having a group session with a coach and some psychology some career goals this and that and that’s the beauty of it to everyone else they’ve just been to the boxing club”  in 2019 efc supported 4245 young people the impact is striking among those young people the suicide ideation rate dropped significantly and 74 are no longer at risk of exclusion from school 78 are no longer committing antisocial or criminal behaviour 84 are more motivated and 73 are happier  according to rees “the benefits to the wider city are pretty straightforward a healthier population young people who are less likely to become mentally unwell who have more structure in their lives and who are better able to develop their own talents abilities and ambitions in life they are also less likely to become service users or engage in activities that take away the quality of life from other people”  for ivall efc is “almost like a onestop community shop … with support and care and i’m going to use the word love though the boxing guys would probably shoot me for that there is support of real compassion and kindness which is unjudgmental and nondiscriminatory in any shape size or form it doesn’t matter who you are if you come through that door you can have that support that’s lifechanging”  “we’re not careers specialists we’re not education specialists we’re not mental health specialists” says bisp “we’ve had to just do our best and what we think is right and thankfully the results over the last 10 years have proven that what we do does work”']\n",

brought his family to hong kong where he became a schoolteacher  years later lee’s father told him he had chosen to come to the british colony because it was a safe haven for his children and he wanted to avoid being involved with either party  he did not want to continue serving the corrupt nationalist government nor stay in china to serve the communist government which he did not trust zhou

father found stability and peace is under threat as never before  on friday china revealed its plan to impose a national security law on hong kong to prevent and punish acts of “secession subversion or terrorism activities” that threaten national security the plan which bypasses the city’s legislature would also allow chinese national security organs to set up in the city  the move led to widespread unease in hong kong “to people of my father’s generation this is a huge irony because they thought this would be a safe haven for their families” said lee now 81  li yinwo left martin lee

precedent for beijing to legislate on hong kong’s behalf we’re the meat on the chopping board”  beijing has wanted hong kong to legislate a national security law since 2003 but it was shelved after mass protests that year as the current antigovernment movement approaches its first anniversary and with china having run out of patience with hong kong’s increasingly violent unrest it decided to apply its national security laws through the basic law’s annex iii which allows national laws to be applied to the city  but lee a barrister who qualified in lincoln’s inn and became qc in 1979 said

“not aware that victoria has engaged in any concrete projects under bri let alone projects impinging on telecommunications networks which we understand are a federal matter”  while the us would have to examine any future initiatives that risked the integrity of networks that was “a very remote hypothetical” and the us had “every confidence that australia as a close ally and five eyes partner

treated by a pm as mugs the moral question is not for cummings – it is for pm and ministersmps who find this behaviour acceptable what are we to teach our children i ask as a responsible father”  the church of england could decide to review its work with the government during the pandemic said david walker the bishop of manchester “unless very soon we see clear repentance including the sacking of cummings i no longer know how we can trust what ministers say sufficiently for churchofengland to work together with them on the pandemic”  the bishop of durham paul butler whose diocese covers the cummings family farm said “there will be those in durham who defend boris for his standing by dominiccummngs but most who have worked so hard to abide by the rules and guidance of the past weeks will feel hurt angry  let down trust has been broken for the nation’s sake rebuild it quickly”  john inge the bishop of worcester said “the pm’s risible defence of cummings is an insult to all those who have made such sacrifices to ensure the safety of others”  vivienne faull the bishop of bristol tweeted “day 61 livingdifferently in a nation where the pm has no respect for the people the bonds of

coping with difficulty did the right thing and still do vulnerable people are alive today because of the selfdiscipline of so many i thank god for their integrity … it is not good enough to treat the people of this country like sheep who can be fooled”  the bishop of newcastle christine hardman said “i am deeply troubled tonight by the prime minister’s briefing we can forgive mistakes and poor judgment and can understand and admire loyalty but forgiveness and understanding need openness and we did not see this tonight”  pete wilcox the bishop of sheffield said “i don’t usually tweet politics and i have carefully steered clear during the pandemic but tonight i must say the pm  his cabinet are undermining the trust of the electorate and the risks to life are real”  the bishop of reading olivia graham said she was “deeply worried by the pm’s judgment call on this one not from a political perspective but a moral one his response lacks both integrity and respect and he has just made his task of leading us through this crisis much much harder”  philip mounstephen the bishop of truro said “in this country government and the rule of law depend largely and rightly on the principle of consent but that depends in turn on the consistency integrity  impartiality of govt and the application of the law that is now hugely strained a moment of real and serious concern”  emma
