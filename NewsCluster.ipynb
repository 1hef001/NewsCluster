governments social welfare programme for retirees has been a theme for the vermont senator in recent days as he seeks to boost his campaign  reform of such socalled entitlement programmes has long been a political bugaboo for candidates as well as elected officials and mr bidens decadeslong career has laid bare this point a senator before his stint as vicepresident mr biden argued that social security should be subject to government austerity when i argued that we should freeze federal spending i meant social security as well he said in 1995 i meant every single solitary thing in the government and i not only tried it once i tried it twice i tried it a third time and i tried it a fourth time  when challenged on this record on the campaign trail mr biden has flatout denied backing social security cuts his campaign has said that if elected a president biden would expand the programme paying for it through a tax on the wealthy  despite his past comments opinion polling of florida

website fivethirtyeight found that white women were the single largest voting group in the super tuesday primaries that turned around mr bidens campaign fortunes  given the importance of female voters it is hardly surprising that mr bidens votes on reproductive health would be scrutinised mr sanders has honed in on the former vicepresidents positions on abortion which have transformed over the past few decades as a senator in 1981 he voted to support an amendment that would have allowed states to overturn the landmark supreme court ruling guaranteeing the us right to abortion as recently as last year he said he still supported the hyde amendment which forbids public money from being used for abortions but reversed course after it became clear he was the only democrat in the field who did so

that it is not him but mr trump who is in the pockets of wall street  at one point he said he would eschew taking money from political action committees  private groups that can donate big money to

governments doing  people have no idea what it would mean to lose this magnificent hydrological system  antonio nobre says the ring made by centralsouthern brazil and the river plate basin would be a desert if it wasnt for the amazon  it affects the ecosystem of the whole region including those who are not part of the amazon itself and beyond  more than 33 million people live in the amazon  about 8 of the population of south america  in towns cities riverside communities and indigenous villages there are at least 100 tribes who have had little or no contact with outsiders  deforestation and its causes are a major source of friction between the governments of the nine amazon nations environmentalists companies and indigenous groups the desire for economic development clashes in the main with the preservation of the amazon and its native peoples   that doesnt seem an easy task in the near future  if we could restore 60000 or 70000 sq km in this large area where the dry season is already much longer we could help the forest get back to working better and it would be more resilient  first we should adopt a zero deforestation policy in panamazonas immediately together with a reforestation programme in the south southeast and east of the amazon which are the most vulnerable areas  according to carlos nobre there is a way  replacing the rainforest with another ecosystem this increase could be even greater or could happen sooner  even if the conditions we have at the moment stay the same temperatures in the amazon region could increase by 8c taking into account deforestation and global warming by 2070  and temperature increases could lead to more heatrelated cardiovascular and respiratory diseases says beatriz oliveira from brazils climate change investigations network redclima  the process of degradation could make the insects look for other sources of food and get closer to urban settlements  some studies link deforestation to an increase in illnesses transmitted by mosquitoes such as malaria and leishmaniasis  this could have a catastrophic impact on the local economy less rain and higher temperatures mean less water for animals or growing crops like soya  but brazilian climatologist carlos nobre says temperatures in the region could increase by 153c in the areas which become degraded savannahs and that is without taking into account possible increases already caused by global warming  scientists cant say exactly what a sudden transformation of the amazon rainforest would mean  this means it could be even closer than they think but what could happen after the tipping point  the projection however still does not take into account degradation because of the difficulty of measuring it across panamazonas  the joint amazon biome across the different national borders  it would cause the length of the dry season and temperatures in the forest to increase trees would start to die and the tropical rainforest could become more like a dry savannah  this will happen when total deforestation reaches between 20 and 25  and that could happen in the next 20 or 30 years  we could be dangerously close to what scientists call the tipping point  when the nature of the amazon will completely change  if deforestation and degradation continue at current levels the amazon could stop working as a tropical ecosystem even if some of it is still standing  among the amazon countries only brazil regularly publishes annual degradation figures however scientists from across the region are trying to produce the relevant data to form a wider picture of the current state of the forest  it is a difficult phenomenon to measure because although you can see degradation on satellite images you need to have data from the ground to understand the real picture  whether that area is more or less degraded or is recovering says alexander lees  so why dont they talk about degradation when measuring forest loss in the amazon  a recent report by the colombian government confirms that between 2012 and 2015 its own amazon region lost 187955 hectares of forest to deforestation and 414605 hectares to degradation  more than double  mr nobre says the degraded areas of the amazon are nearly twice as big as the deforested areas  if we take the deforestation and degradation together more than 50 of the amazon no longer performs environmental services for the regions climate says antonio nobre  degradation also makes the forest less efficient it loses for example the ability to generate some of its own rain  and in seven of the nine amazon countries they say degradation is the main source of their carbon dioxide emissions  scientists also warn that degradation is an important factor in releasing stored co2 a new study by raisg says 47 of all the emissions in the amazon are as a result of degradation  even though not all the vegetation is lost the soil is drier and more fragile this changes the microclimate of the forest and makes it easier for fires to spread because the soil heats up faster explains alexander lees professor of tropical ecology at manchester metropolitan university in the uk  this phenomenon is as much the result of climatic events  such as drought as human action  such as burning or illegal logging which strip the forest of its vital functions however seen from above it may seem that the forest is still standing  experts like antonio nobre believe that deforestation does not show the full picture of what is being lost and we should also take into account degradation  a recent study claimed that 20 of the amazon is already emitting more co2 that it absorbs  for this reason scientists fear that the amazon will stop being a carbon store and will instead become a serious emitter of co2 accelerating the effects of climate change  one of the direct effects of deforestation is that it releases co2 stored in the forest forest fires or the decomposition of felled trees both transform the carbon within the tree back into gas  according to dr berenguer a large tree with at least three metres circumference can contain between three and four tonnes of carbon this is the same as about 10 to 12 tonnes of co2 or what a family car emits over four years  the older and larger the tree the more carbon it stores  a small part of the co2 absorbed by trees during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere during respiration the rest is transformed into carbon which the trees use to produce the sugars needed for their metabolism  primary forest is home to trees that can be hundreds or even thousands of years old they perform a powerful role in mitigating the effects of climate change as they act as an enormous carbon dioxide store  in the last 10 years figures for primary forest loss have remained high or spiked in most of the amazon nations  each hectare deforested means part of the ecosystem ceases to function and this affects the rest says oxford university rainforest expert erika berenguer  this may seem insignificant  only 032 of the forest in the whole amazon biome  but it is also a question of quality  a football pitch is frequently used as a reference because according to fifa the maximum size of a pitch is 108 hectares however some countries use smaller dimensions which is why deforestation calculations can vary so much  almost half of this was primary forest  17 million hectares of forest that was still in its original state and rich in biodiversity its destruction was the same as three football pitches of virgin forest being destroyed every minute in 2018  in 2018 alone the tree cover loss in the amazon reached four million hectares 40000 sq km according to global forest watch  the most common way of measuring deforestation is tree cover loss  where forest vegetation has been completely erased  scientists say that if we dont reverse current levels of deforestation and degradation the consequences of climate change could accelerate  even if an area does not lose all its trees and vegetation degradation strips the rainforest of properties that are vital to the planet  this happens when a combination of pressures on a stretch of forest  such as fires logging or unlicensed hunting  make it hard for the ecosystem to function properly  to get a more complete sense of the scale of the destruction mr nobre says it is necessary to take into account the figures for degradation  the destruction of the amazon rainforest up till now is much bigger than the almost 20 that they talk of in the media  to only speak of deforestation when we refer to the loss of the amazon is what i call the great green lie says climate scientist antonio donato nobre  but that is not the only problem  brazil and bolivia were among the top five countries for loss of primary forest in 2018 and both saw a dramatic increase in wildfires last year  even before this year’s spike in deforestation the rate across the nine amazon countries had continued to rise  the brazilian authorities are deploying troops in the amazon region to help protect the rainforest tackle illegal deforestation and forest fires but critics say that the government’s rhetoric and policies could actually be encouraging loggers and illegal miners  last year an unprecedented number of fires devastated huge swathes of forest in the amazon peak fire season is from july which some experts worry could coincide with the peak of the coronavirus crisis  in april as the number of cases rose and states started adopting isolation measures deforestation actually increased 64 compared with the same month in 2019 according to preliminary satellite data from space research agency inpe  but many of the field agents working to protect reserves have pulled out jonathan mazower of survival international says allowing loggers and miners to target these areas  as elsewhere social distancing and travel restrictions have been imposed to limit the spread of the virus  since coronavirus spread to brazil in march amazonas has been the state to register brazils highest infection rates  it also has one of the most underfunded health systems in the country  the largest and most diverse tropical rainforest in the world is home to 33 million people and thousands of species of plants and animals  here we look at the pressures pushing the amazon to the brink and ask what the nine countries that share this unique natural resource are doing to protect it  deforestation illegal mining land clearances and wildfires were already at an 11year high and scientists say were fast approaching a point of no return  after which the amazon will no longer function as it should  deforestation jumped 55 in the first four months of 2020 compared with the same period last year as

by ipam and the federal university of acre found otherwise  according to their report the amazon fires are directly related to deforestation  after felling the trees they leave it to dry for a few months then set fire to it to clear the vegetation the land is then used to plant grass and create pastures says erika berenguer  source reuters  according to the fao 80 of tree loss in brazil is

are not conservation areas nor indigenous territories for example people clear this land cut the trees down and put cattle on them its the cheapest way to occupy them says stabile  a patch of land without trees is worth more on the market  the primary use of deforested land in brazil is cattle but the aim is not necessarily to earn money from meat production but from the sale of land marcelo stabile of ipam the amazon environmental research institute  the next step in the chain is to illegally obtain a title deed for the land and sell it says mr stabile they then find another patch of forest and start again the land is often sold to largescale farmers and it is hard to tell which was cleared legally and what wasnt  the same happens in colombia peru and ecuador  according to mr stabile and other investigators brazil could double or triple its number of cattle without felling another hectare of the amazon rainforest  whats happening is land speculation he says if the

reciprocal measures for any european country enforcing a quarantine  travellers arriving in france from spain by plane will also be asked to go into quarantine from monday  speaking at fridays downing street briefing ms patel said travellers to the uk will need to tell the government where they will quarantine and face enforcement through random spot checks and £1000 fines in england if they do not

scotlands first minister nicola sturgeon said discussions would take place with police scotland to work out how the policy will be implemented  not shutting down  ms patel told the briefing the measures were not the same as completely shutting the uk border to visitors  we are not shutting down completely we are not closing our borders she said  and asked about the prospect of foreign holidays this summer the home secretary added this is absolutely not about booking holidays we want to avoid a second wave and that is absolutely vital  socalled air bridges  agreements with countries that have low infection rates allowing tourists to travel without quarantining  will not be in place initially the government said  the new measure previously announced by prime minister boris johnson will be reviewed every three weeks once it is introduced  but airlines have said a quarantine requirement would effectively kill air travel  and one airport boss described the plans as a blunt tool  the government currently recommends international travel only when absolutely necessary and nobody should travel if they display any coronavirus symptoms  victoria bacon from abta the travel industry trade body told the bbc the government needs to come up with some wider more forward thinking strategies for the industry  theres a whole range of support not just financial that the government can put in place to start helping the sector and weve heard very little from them we really desperately need some help she said  what does the new system involve  passengers arriving in the uk will be required to fill out an online locator contact form  providing details of where they will spend their 14 days in selfisolation  the home office said the proposed accommodation will need to meet necessary requirements such as a hotel or a private address with friends or family  there will be a fine of £100 for failure to complete the form and the border force will have the power to refuse entry to nonuk citizens who do not comply with the new regulations  new arrivals will be told they may be contacted at any time during their quarantine and in england may be visited by public health authorities conducting spot checks  they will be told to avoid public transport and travel to their accommodation by car where possible and not to go out to buy food or other essentials where they can rely on others  in england a breach of selfisolation would be punishable by a £1000 fixed penalty notice or prosecution and an unlimited fine for persistent offenders  why now  analysis by helen catt political correspondent  the big question being asked about quarantine is why now  the government argues that it simply wouldnt have made enough of a difference while the virus was spreading widely within the uk  but it hasnt so far fully explained why such a blanket measure was not introduced much earlier in the outbreak before the virus took hold  people returning from wuhan city and hubei province in china were put into isolation for 14 days from late january  later those returning from italy were told to selfisolate  but the measure was not extended to travellers from every country  there are also questions about how this will work in practice and what it will mean for the travel industry which is already suffering huge losses  the home office has published a full list of exemptions to the new requirements  the list includes road haulage and freight workers medical professionals travelling to fight covid19 and seasonal farm workers who will selfisolate where they are working  ms patel said the new measures aim to keep the transmission rate down and prevent a devastating second wave  i fully expect the majority of people will do the right thing and abide by these measures but we will take enforcement action against the minority of people who endanger the safety of others she added  labours shadow home secretary nick thomassymonds said the party supported the

station  elon musks company spacex is about to launch its space vehicle  the crew dragon  with astronauts onboard for the first time here we answer some common questions about the mission  why is a private company launching nasa astronauts  nasa has been planning to hand over the transport of crew to the international space station iss since the early 2000s after the columbia space shuttle broke up during its return to earth in 2003 the space agency focused on developing a replacement spaceship that could travel to the moon involving private firms in the transfer of crew and cargo to the iss was a necessary step to afford that programme in 2014 entrepreneur elon musks company spacex and aerospace giant boeing were announced as winners of a nasa contract for crew transport services spacex is launching its spacecraft first the crew dragon spacecraft will lift off on wednesday atop a falcon 9 rocket from floridas kennedy space center  what is spacex  spacex is an american company that provides commercial and government launch services on its falcon 9 and falcon heavy rockets entrepreneur elon musk founded the company in 2002 with the goal of reducing space transportation costs enabling the colonisation of mars spacex was the first private company to routinely return rocket stages to earth under propulsive power so they could be reflown rather than being discarded it has been conducting regular flights of cargo to the iss and will now aim to begin launching astronauts musks company is also developing a bigger spacecraft to carry humans  called starship  which could begin the process of settling mars  image copyright spacex image caption the crew dragon will seat a maximum of four during nasa missions to the iss  who is elon musk  born in south africa elon musk made more than 160m from the sale of online payment service paypal to ebay his desire to see humanity become a true spacefaring civilisation was a driving factor behind the founding of spacex but he

its astronauts on the soyuz spacecraft the crew dragon launch from florida marks the first launch of humans from us soil in nine years as such it is seen as crucial for restoring american prestige in human spaceflight this will also be the first time a private company has launched astronauts into orbit  what is the crew dragon  the crew dragon is the spacecraft that will transport astronauts to the iss on wednesday it is a sleek evolution of the dragon spacecraft which was built to ferry cargo to the orbiting outpost the crew dragon is designed to carry a maximum of seven passengers but nasa flights will carry four with the rest of the space taken up by supplies it is equipped with thrusters that enable it to manoeuvre in space and will dock  or attach  to the space station under

spacecraft through its paces hurley has spent a total of 28 days and 11 hours in space while behnken has accumulated a total of 29 days and 12 hours including 37 hours of spacewalking time both men are also married to astronauts  image copyright reuters image caption bob behnken l and doug hurley arrived in florida on 20 may to prepare for launch  what are the astronauts there to do  spacecraft

will test the crew dragons environmental control system the displays and controls and the manoeuvring thrusters they will monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station

earth the crew dragon will parachute down into the atlantic ocean the capsule and crew will then be recovered by a ship called go navigator  what if something goes wrong during the launch  the crew dragon has a builtin abort system designed to save the lives of its crew in the event of an emergency if theres a problem during liftoff such as a rocket engine cutoff the crew dragon will fire engines to propel the vehicle and its occupants free of the rocket the capsule will then parachute down to safety spacex successfully conducted a test of its inflight abort system on 19 january 2020  what about those spacesuits  the flight suits that behnken and hurley will wear in the capsule look very different to previous designs in stark contrast to the bulky pumpkincoloured suits and round helmets familiar from the space shuttle era spacexs suits are slimline white onepiece numbers with sleek 3dprinted helmets each one is custom made for the astronaut if they look like something from a science fiction movie thats probably because their look was devised by hollywood costume designer jose fernandez who has worked on the batman xmen and thor movies but the suits also have to be

have to work  they say they have only managed to visit the beach a couple of times partly because of heavy rain during the current monsoon season and also because they are fasting during the holy month of ramadan  both are also back at work but struggle to connect via wifi to conference calls  but getting home is not straightforward as residents of the uae but not citizens they say they were not allowed onto flights returning others to the gulf  and while flying to egypt on a repatriation flight could have been an option it would have meant a 14day quarantine in a government facility  and still being unable to return to their home in dubai  they are calling on the uae authorities to help them and other residents who are stranded they have applied for approval to travel from the governments official portal but are yet to receive permission  and in any case no flights are currently available  it gets more stressful every time we read in the news that the airlines are postponing the date of going back into operation… well definitely do whatever were asked when it comes to quarantine whether at a hotel or selfquarantining home peri said  image copyright khalid and peri image caption their two month trip has been far from what they thought when they left for mexico  when it comes to the mounting cost of the trip the couple have decided not to do the maths until we go back because we dont know when its going to end  still they know others around the world are in far more difficult positions but they emphasise the trip has been far from an extended honeymoon  its always sad when youre in a resort and youre the last guests there and all the staff are waving byebye to you you feel bad for them too… that happened twice to us said khaled places like this should be full of people and good moments thats not the case right now  every time we tell people we are stuck in the maldives they laugh and theyre like its not the worst situation i wish i could be in your position peri added its not as easy or happy its definitely very stressful… enjoy being at home with family i would take that over anything']\n",

            "['126', 'dominic cummings and the battle for downing street', 'for someone who regards himself as a disruptive outsider dominic cummings has never felt the need to please anyone and so boris johnson had his work cut out when he asked cummings to join him in downing street last july the new prime minister described it as a “hairy” mission  one friend recalls “boris was really turning the thumbscrews on dom saying ‘you’ve got to come in you’ve got to come in’”  cummings tabled what he called a series of “terrorist demands” to the incoming prime minister after judging according to one friend that his team had monumentally failed to draw up a coherent plan  the boldest demand which was at the centre of the eventual showdown with sajid javid was to be given control of the network of special advisers the political appointees who work for cabinet ministers by controlling the special advisers cummings would gain significant leverage over cabinet ministers  to his surprise the new prime minister said yes to his demands cummings therefore entered downing street with one immediate plan  to sort out the “mess” of brexit  and a longer vision to transform the workings of government  “we are going to bulldoze our way to make sure brexit happens” was the cummings view at the time “it has to happen”  in a fraught autumn for the tory party which saw the evisceration of the proeuropean wing of the party cummings deployed his own powers sometimes without mercy  relations started to sour with javid when his special adviser sonia khan was unceremoniously and highly controversially marched out of no 10 last august after falling out with cummings the sacking of khan  who was escorted out of downing street by an armed police officer  chilled the atmosphere in whitehall javid was not even aware it was happening  cummings is not the loner he is sometimes portrayed as and knows power when he sees it on the day johnson became prime minister a scruffylooking cummings made sure to frame himself in the corner of a photo taken as the cabinet secretary and the man in charge of the civil service sir mark sedwill welcomed the new pm to no 10 sedwill could well be seen as the epitome of the sort of generalist  a career flitting between the foreign office and the home office  scorned by cummings  but gisela stuart the former labour minister who chaired the vote leave campaign who knows both men well says “i remember looking at that picture and i thought sedwill and dom have a lot in common both of them are big picture people both of them are deeply strategic both of them are terribly focused i think they want the same thing”  with the fate of brexit unknown in a hung parliament cummings advised johnson to take a risky gamble by going for an early general election  cummings is widely praised for pushing for it but was blunt about the dangers at the time “this election is very risky very risky for us” he was heard to say “anyone who says they know what is going to happen or thinks we will walk it is an idiot”  the electoral gamble paid off but cummings was unhappy – feeling that his control of special advisers had failed to impose enough discipline he was highly suspicious of the team working for javid cummings had technically taken control of the network of special advisers but they were still in effect answerable to their cabinet minister and not to him  also cummings wanted to inject new characters into the machinery of government he used a blog on 2 january to call on “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to join him in delivering the large changes in policy and decisionmaking he said were required by brexit  cummings indicated that 35000 people had answered his call they must have been attracted by the job specification in which he wrote “i don’t want confident public school bluffers i want people who are much brighter than me who can work in an extreme environment if you play office politics you will be discovered and immediately binned”  but cummings faced a rebuke from a writer cited in one of his blogs william gibson mocked cummings for appearing to liken himself to the “quasi evil genius” hubertus bigend in his novel pattern recognition “the idea of people like that being made bureaucrats is quite unnerving” gibson told the bbc  a former cabinet minister accuses cummings of ruthless tactics which have involved injecting populism into the political discourse and undermining the constitution when parliament was suspended last year david gauke who stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate in the election after he was deprived of the tory whip says “you can admire the ruthless determination to pursue a strategy which very few people would do in as determined a manner as he has done but it is a strategy which is reckless and damaging for the country in the undermining of institutions”  but the former mp sir nicholas soames who lost the tory whip at the same time as gauke admires cummings soames who eventually had the whip restored says “dominic cummings is an exceptionally gifted and clever man every government needs a disruptor governments that don’t have disruptors become complacent and run out of steam the predictable pretend loathing of cummings is totally pathetic”  but cummings has made enemies in a potentially significant camp  friends of sajid javid “the handling of sajid was gratuitous” one said “is it really wise to create a prince across the water so early on”  friends of cummings are divided on what the future holds for him as he lives with the inevitable compromises of government one says he is a pragmatist  but another says that cummings’s irritation with david cameron’s vetoing of his plan to scrap gcses shows he is prepared to walk “dom is not there to please he’s there to get stuff done if the principal boris doesn’t follow that plan he will say ‘you’re not interested in taking my advice i’m out of here’”  a divisive polemicist both charming and abrasive dominic cummings is wielding immense power in the name of a prime minister with an historic mandate it is a natural meeting of minds between two idiosyncratic political beasts with eclectic interests in the classical world and beyond  johnson summoned cummings in his first hour of need when brexit and the future of the conservative party were in jeopardy cummings was the right fit for the first phase of boris johnson in no 10 it will be a cliffhanger to see how long the match lasts']\n",
            "['127', 'coronavirus the bolivian orchestra stranded in a german castle', 'image copyright ariel laura  the sound of panpipes flutes and snare drums fills the rehearsal space of the orquesta experimental de instrumentos nativos  the breathing techniques required to play these instruments for a few hours put you in a kind of trance says miguel cordoba who plays the siku flute  but as soon as the rehearsal finishes they are all too aware of how their life has changed because they are not rehearsing back home in la paz bolivia but in the shadow of a german castle where they have been stranded for 73 days  the musicians most of whom have never left bolivia before were expecting to spend just over a fortnight this spring touring east germanys concert halls  instead they are holed up in the buildings and grounds of the sprawling estate of rheinsberg palace a moated castle which has been home to generations of german royalty and aristocracy an hour and a halfs drive northwest of berlin  image copyright getty images  as the musicians some of whom are as young as 17 touched down in germany on 10 march for their tour news broke that berlin had become the seventh german region to impose a ban on gatherings of 1000 people or more in response to the coronavirus pandemic  our bus broke down on the motorway i remember joking that this was bad luck and perhaps our concerts would be cancelled recollects carlos but never did i think it would actually happen  their three planned performances were cancelled in the days that followed and as bolivias government announced it would close its borders the orchestra scrambled to get home but failed  germanys ban on mass gatherings was swiftly followed by a full lockdown meaning the musicians are only allowed to roam as far as the forest that lines the perimeter of the estate  so their free time is spent rehearsing in the nearly 600yearold palace grounds and exploring the surrounding woodland home to 23 packs of wolves  only on monday did they get the chance to step inside the castle for the first time as tours for the public reopened  its very different to my home its very beautiful says 25yearold miguel  image copyright ariel laura image caption rehearsing in the guest house of rheinsberg palace  there are worse places to be trapped when i wake up i watch the sun rise over the forest and the lake back home i only hear the sound of traffic  but despite the picturesque natural surroundings the musicians are worried they have been forgotten  we feel abandoned says carlos whos spent several thankless hours on the phone to the bolivian embassy trying to find a way to get home  the group had only been in germany for a week when bolivias president announced the countrys border was set to close within days and all international flights had been suspended  arrangements were swiftly made by the german foreign office and bolivian embassy to reserve seats on one of the last flights out of germany to south america landing in lima peru  the group was initially relieved  when we were on the way to the airport we were all in good spirits laughing and chatting says camed martela 20  but then carlos received a call to say the flight had been cancelled as the plane was not allowed to land in peru  the mood suddenly became sombre  everyone on the bus went quiet he says  from that moment the 6000 miles 9656km between germany and bolivia seemed further than ever  tracy prado who only joined the orchestra in december remembers thinking about her daughters 11th birthday which was coming up a few weeks later  i had got my hopes up and it was devastating to think i would miss this important day she says  image copyright ariel laura  the group decided the only way to cope was to put together a strict practice schedule  three hours before lunch three hours after experimenting with a fusion of traditional andean music and more contemporary genres  indigenous music is all about the principle of community  everybody can take something from what they are and offer it to the group says carlos  you feel the same as your ancestors felt when playing these traditional instruments which is a beautiful thing adds miguel whose roots stretch back to bolivias kallawaya people known for their musical healing ceremonies  some members of the orchestra speak to their families in bolivia for others communication is near impossible as internet and telephone signals are patchy outside bolivias main cities  many of the musicians play a major role in providing for their families financially and being unable to do this at the moment is exacerbating their anxiety  in an interview with bolivias flagship station radio panamericana foreign minister karen longaric was asked for her response to the orchestras case after a distraught mother of one of the musicians called in  longaric suggested the orchestra left knowing the borders were set to soon close although bolivia had not recorded a single coronavirus case on the day they left  she also said the governments priorities were elsewhere  repatriating the most vulnerable  women children sick people and the elderly  image copyright ariel laura  carlos says there seems to be little sympathy for the orchestra back in bolivia  people back home think were in a fairytale land he says rolling his eyes ive had hundreds of messages telling me to stop complaining and that im living like a princess in a german castle  camed is disappointed they have not been able to perform as planned  wed been preparing since january so i became quite depressed as i watched everything wed prepared for get taken away like this  the orchestra helped me get back on track after the death of my dad my family were so proud of me when they heard i was flying to europe to perform my countrys music  the town of just over 8000 people also called rheinsberg has largely been welcoming towards the bolivian visitors if a little bemused by their presence  when i leave the hostel alone i do feel a little selfconscious camed says sometimes i get strange looks and people stop and stare  some go further than a raised eyebrow perhaps confused by the fact that the musicians appear to be flouting germanys social distancing rules as it may not be immediately obvious that they have been allowed to classify themselves as a family unit  image copyright ariel laura  he says on one of the occasions the bolivians played a game of football on the meadow directly in front of the castle they soon found themselves surrounded by six police officers in full riot gear just short of a helmet says timo kreuser one of three german musicians who helped facilitate the tour and are staying with them  they came from from left and right and started to encircle us and things got a little tense recalls miguel  in the end they just told us that we couldnt congregate in such a large group but it wasnt too serious  the police are used to it now so they just phone me and its always resolved says timo  timo has been keen to help the musicians partly to repay the favour of their own hospitality when he was with them in la paz in october violent protests led to the resignation of the president and carlos and the orchestra helped timo evacuate to peru  generosity and offers of help have been in plentiful supply from most people  the kitchen staff at the guest house the musicians are living in come in to work wearing masks and maintain a distance from their bolivian guests  we are so grateful for the food and the roofs over our heads says tracy who speculates shes one of only a few in the group who enjoy the local delicacies  and of course they have the woodland to explore tracy says she spotted three wolves while out walking recently  i froze in fear but they were just play fighting and moved on  it is not just wolves they look out for  one of the palaces former inhabitants was frederick the great who was given ownership of the estate by his father in 1736 before he ascended to the throne and described his time at rheinsberg as his happiest years  image copyright getty images image caption the musicians are very aware of the palaces previous inhabitants including frederick the great  a close friend of frederick reflecting on his impressions of rheinsberg wrote the evenings are dedicated to music the prince has concerts in his salon where noone is admitted unless called one of those who performed was reportedly jc bach  we all joke that fredericks ghost is following us and trying to trip us up says camed i dont usually believe in such things but it does feel as if there are ghosts on the grounds  as the seasons shifted from early spring to summer the musicians heavy clothes packed in anticipation of colder weather were too warm for their long walks around the estate  but a concerned bolivian expat in hamburg has helped out on this front  she collected mountains of clothes and sent them to us we have seven big boxes so far  perhaps too many we may need to return some or pass them onto someone else in need says carlos  but despite the generosity and good will the orchestra worries that its stay cannot be bankrolled forever  accommodation costs are mounting to more than €35000 38400 a month alone says berno odo polzer the director of maerzmusik the festival at which the orchestra were set to perform it is one of several publicly funded arts programmes which has supported the orchestras longer than expected stay  germany is allowing international flights again but bolivias borders remain shut for the foreseeable future  the bolivian embassy told the bbc it is trying to get the orchestra on a flight to bolivia in early june out of madrid  but carlos is worried about how things will be once they return too  covid is getting very political back home says carlos  the bolivian government delayed the presidential election that was due in march and later tried and failed to force through a decree limiting freedom of expression and criticisms over the handling of the coronavirus crisis  im dreaming of the day i will be at my bed in bolivia and say ok this is over but i also know that on that day i will start missing what is happening here admits carlos  all images subject to copyright']\n",

works for imran khan  partners the firm that represented the family of the murdered black teenager stephen lawrence  he maintains the tragedy at shredmet is only a small part of a wider problem the men’s deaths he warns have implications for anyone employed in similar jobs  the industry the men were employed in  waste and recycling  is the second most dangerous in the uk between 2014 and 2018 almost eight in every 100000 workers died this rate is 17 times the national average according to a 2019 hse report  it is among the uk’s most lucrative industries worth an estimated £7bn a year to the economy in recent years it has enjoyed a boom demand has been driven by rising metal prices a shortage of landfill sites and laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in them  mr cooper says the recycling industry “exploits migrant labour for enormous profits”  daniel lemberger cooper said the mens deaths raised issues for every worker in britain daniel lemberger cooper said the mens deaths raised issues for every worker in britain  “there is a now huge demand for recycling and the industry is getting bigger and bigger and these workers will be needed more and more” he says  “the five men were honest hardworking and decent human beings  “the conditions in which these workers were employed of precarious employment zerohours contracts temporary and agency work the socalled gig economy and exploitation and issues of low pay and long hours are spreading throughout the economy” he adds  “this is an issue for every worker in britain”  leading safety experts say the standard of the uk’s health and safety enforcement has declined over the past decade  after years of cuts there are fewer inspectors carrying out fewer inspections leaving many workplaces unsafe they say  shredmet had not been inspected by the hse since the 2010 accident in which an employee injured their arm  lawrence waterman chairman of the british safety council says the hse has been underresourced since the days of the coalition government  in 2010 the government imposed 33 cuts on the hse then in 2012 the prime minister david cameron stated the uks excessive health and safety culture was costing businesses billions and he intended to kill it off for good  after the conservatives won the general election in 2015 further cuts followed in the spending review later that year  lawrence waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe lawrence waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe  “it’s not just resources that have had an impact” says mr waterman  it’s the political hangover of now two prime ministers ago who wanted to kill health and safety with a feeling that red tape ruled and we were being told how to live our lives  “well the other side of that is that five guys never came home to their families  “hanging over businesses and the government is the need to be honest and place more value on looking after people at work”  hilda palmer from the hazards campaign which promotes workplace safety says a disproportionately large number of those killed or injured at work are immigrants  “unfortunately if you look at the names of the people that are killed they are mostly foreignsounding names  eastern europeans and now west african” she says  “i also know of a case involving some peruvians it seems it’s the new wave of migrants that get drawn in  the most vulnerable”  flowers left at the site of the accident in 2016 flowers left at the site of the accident in 2016  she says legislation enforcement and trade unions have all been “attacked through the cuts”  “that creates an environment for cowboys to flourish” she added “if employers see checks being done prosecutions fines and notices being issued that reminds them to act”  the conservatives declined to comment but vince cable the former liberal democrat leader who was a member of the coalition cabinet says the global financial crisis was to blame  “austerity was going to happen whatever government came in” he says  “the cuts labour chancellor alistair darling had were the same as what the coalition did and this was as a result of the huge financial crisis and reduced revenue that the country found itself in”  laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling  the dead mens families remain bewildered that three years after the accident the hse has still not decided whether or not to charge shredmet  mr waterman says the slowness of the hse investigation is due to its underfunding the hse aims to complete 80 of fatal investigations within one year but in 201819 just 65 were  “when you look at that it’s not unreasonable for the families to feel that justice is being denied” mr waterman says  “if the families of the five guys were pluggedin middleclass agitators there may have been more pressure being felt to keep the hse focused on finding out what happened”  “if immediate legislative change is not enacted there are going to be more injuries and further deaths”  the hse says the families’ demand for a speedy conclusion is “understandable” but it needs to ensure its investigation is “thorough”  “as with many complex challenging criminal investigations relating to multiple fatalities following new lines of inquiry and forensically examining evidence can mean investigations take longer than families would understandably hope” a spokesman says  “since the inquests concluded our time and energy has been fully focused on reviewing the case bringing together evidence heard by the coroner and concluding the criminal investigation  “we are working hard to resolve any delays and have endeavoured to give regular updates to the families where possible”  the families lawyer believes they are the victims of a legal system that does not treat deaths at work with the same seriousness as other fatalities  “the criminal justice system fails to treat deaths and injuries at work – unlike deaths in almost any other setting – as the possible outcome of serious crimes and this must urgently change” mr cooper says  he wants the government to legislate to prevent the exploitation of workers  “a fitting tribute and legacy to those that died would be that immediate steps are taken by government to ensure that we learn the lessons of why these men died so that noone else suffers like they have” he says  “if immediate legislative change is not enacted there are going to be more injuries and further deaths the government and employers will have blood on their hands”']\n",

hooked up to a ventilator in a covid ward  rajesh was being treated in northwick park hospital in london the city where he worked as an uber driver for most of the year mary was 5000 miles away in their family home in bangalore india with their two young sons until that point he had repeatedly told her he would be fine that he was feeling ill but she was not to worry hed get better  at 44 years old he was young and otherwise healthy  but on that call he broke down and admitted mary im feeling a bit scared  rajesh jayaseelan died the following day  rajesh and mary got married on 24 february 2014 and rented a home in hulimavu south bangalore that they shared with his 66yearold mum for most of the year rajesh rented a room in harrow north london and drove an uber vehicle in the city hed work from late in the evening to the early hours of the morning  the busy hours  so he could save enough money to spend a few months with his family in india  he enjoyed working as a driver although he didnt realise that his precarious gig economy job would leave him vulnerable in the global health crisis that would later emerge  hed been living in london onandoff for 22 years and would come back to india for a few months at a time mary says he loved london he always used to talk to me about how beautiful london was and so clean ive never been to london so he would describe it to me  they were very happy rajesh loved his wife and playing with their two sons aged six and four when he wasnt in india he would videocall them every day  he was also a really good singer mary says full of pride he sang a lot of hindi songs  he was also a humble gentle person his close friend sunil kumar adds sunil and rajesh first met in 2011  they were both from bangalore so mutual friends there put them in touch when sunil moved to the uk they would help each other navigate the uks various bureaucratic systems loaned each other small amounts of money when needed and sunil and his wife would have rajesh over for meals at their home in hertfordshire  sending him back with several days worth of leftovers of delicious south indian food  although rajesh loved london he didnt plan to stay forever  he wanted to be reunited with his family in india renting their home in hulimavu was relatively expensive so during his last stay in bangalore at the end of 2019 he and his wife took out a loan and bought land to build their own home the loan was no problem they thought  rajesh would go back to london and put enough money aside to pay it off the next time he travelled to bangalore he told his wife it would be for good  he came back to london on 15 january less than two weeks later the first cases of coronavirus were reported in the uk  image copyright mary jayaseelan image caption rajesh and mary on their wedding day in february 2014  although the virus had reached britain at this point rajesh wasnt too worried shops and restaurants were still open people were still going into work and then going out for everyone including uber drivers it was business as usual and not much changed for another month  then march came around and the virus was passing from person to person within the uk the number of cases  and by now deaths  was increasing every day people were told to selfisolate for seven days if they had any symptoms  even mild ones such as a fever or a persistent cough  on 23 march prime minister boris johnson announced a nationwide lockdown lasting an initial three weeks meaning that most businesses would close and people would only be allowed outside for one form of exercise a day and for essential trips to the shops unless they were considered essential workers  like many uber drivers rajesh continued to work at first but he quickly developed flulike symptoms and had to stop his last job was on 25 march  a dropoff at heathrow airport  his symptoms became much worse and he was admitted to the hospital with dehydration while there he was tested for the coronavirus  it came back positive  staff told rajesh to go home selfisolate and to come back if his symptoms got worse he did as he was told and went home to his room but things were about to get even worse  the landlord sent rajesh out of the house for something and when he came back the landlord had changed the locks so he couldnt get in mary says he tried knocking on the door and asking the landlord to speak to him but he wouldnt open the door  his landlord didnt know about his positive diagnosis  but he told him that as an uber driver he might bring the coronavirus back into the house and that it wasnt a risk he was willing to take  with nowhere else to turn rajesh was forced to sleep in his car for several nights  he had no food in there nothing to eat at all mary says  at this point he called his friend sunil for advice  image copyright mary jayaseelan  that was the last call he made to me sunil says he didnt go into details about what was happening to him but because i work in the nhs he was asking me questions like how safe are we is it better to go to india… things like that he was asking me if i knew any routes if there was any possible way he could go  he wanted to go to india and be with his family but by that time there was a complete lockdown in india too  sunil told him the best thing to do would be to stay at home not to work and to look into the financial support for selfemployed workers the government had just announced or the 14 days assistance offered by uber  rajesh agreed and explained he needed to find a new place to live because his landlord said he was high risk but sunil says he didnt say that hed already been kicked out he may have been embarrassed  rajesh then went back to trying to call his landlord to plead with him to let him stay there was no answer  after days of searching he eventually found another room in a shared house in harrow the new landlord made him pay £4000 upfront  money he didnt have and mary says he had to borrow  what if this happens to me  if your landlord kicks you out of your home without giving you notice or locks you out of your home it is likely to be an illegal eviction  a criminal offence in all uk nations  this is still the case during the coronavirus pandemic under the coronavirus act notice periods for evictions have been extended to three months  this means that for most private and social tenants even if they receive an eviction notice theyre likely to have the legal right to stay in their home andy parnell helpline adviser for housing charity shelter tells the bbc  but he says sadly there are some groups not protected by the recent changes to the evictions law including lodgers with livein landlords  lodgers have fewer rights than private renters with liveout landlords and landlords dont need to go to court to evict a lodger but they are required to provide reasonable notice before asking them to leave the property  people in rajeshs situation should call the local councils homelessness team as soon as possible and all councils have an emergency outofhours number if you dont have anywhere to sleep you should go to the councils office in person bringing id and any proof of immigration status with you  earlier this month shelter also told renters in this situation to stay put  once rajesh was back indoors he didnt want to risk being evicted again he hid himself away and avoided contact with his new landlord and all the other tenants not even daring to try and cook a meal for himself his health became worse with every passing day the only social interaction he had were daily phone calls with his wife where he would alternate between reassuring her that he would be fine and crying  it was during one of these calls that mary noticed he was struggling to breathe  he was wheezing a lot in that room and every day it was getting worse she says one night i told him to go to the hospital he didnt want to call an ambulance because he didnt want others there to know he was ill in case he was evicted again  rajesh drove himself to the hospital despite being severely out of breath when he got there he was diagnosed with pneumonia  the next morning he called me from the hospital for a video call  but when the children saw him they started crying because of how ill he was mary says he turned off his video and told me he didnt want them to remember him looking so unwell they would speak only a few more times  on 11 april the doctors caring for rajesh called mary and explained that he was in a critical state and they didnt think his condition would improve they arranged a video call for her and the children to see him one final time he was unconscious he died two hours later  while coronavirus doesnt discriminate has been repeated often during this pandemic it is evident that the virus is worse for some than others one group hit particularly hard are gig economy workers  the gig economy is where people take on shortterm or freelance work instead of permanent jobs these include privatehire cab drivers like rajesh as well as food delivery workers and couriers last year about 47 million people in the uk worked in gig economy jobs while according to a 2018 study 60 of the global population is in insecure work  research by the world economic forum and other bodies shows these workers are disproportionately affected by the pandemic  a combination of being classified as essential workers requiring them to continue interacting with strangers a lack of guaranteed paid sick leave that makes it harder to selfisolate low and insecure pay making it more likely for them to be living in dangerous and insecure housing situations and no entitlement to risk assessments or protective equipment  ayako ebata from the institute of development studies says because people in insecure work heavily rely on their daily wages they are under a lot of pressure not to lose their jobs or take time off even when there are significant health risks  its not because theyre ignorant or uninformed its because the whole system is forcing them to make decisions that eventually prove detrimental to their livelihoods and health she says  image copyright mary jayaseelan  dr alex wood a sociologist at oxford university focusing on the gig economy and insecure work agrees  and says a lack of workplace protection makes the problem much worse  people have been told by these platforms that they dont need to worry about rights and protections because when the economys fine there isnt really any risk he says in reality when you have these crises its the workers who pay  despite many of them now being classified as essential  now drivers in the uk are calling for greater protection from the government united private hire drivers uphd an independent trade body for privatehire drivers has this week called for an urgent judicial review on the matter  what the government is saying now is that its not safe for you to go to a barbershop but its somehow safe for you to ride around in an uber james farrar from the uphd says  race is a risk factor too according to multiple recent studies bame people in the uk like rajesh are disproportionately more likely to be in insecure work than their white counterparts  research from the trade union congress tuc last year found that ethnic minority workers are a third

i was continually producing a false result in other words it seems i have definitely had coronavirus  fergus on covid  as the bbcs medical correspondent since 2004 i have reported on global disease threats such as bird flu swine flu sars and mers  both coronaviruses  and ebola you could say ive been waiting much of my career for a global pandemic and yet when covid19 came along the world was not as ready as it could have been now its here i wish like everyone else it would go away sadly we may have to live with coronavirus indefinitely in this column i will be reflecting on that new reality  so when was this ive not had any symptoms in recent months im rarely ill but i did have a bout of pneumonia in early january i was off sick for about 10 days and had a cough and a high temperature i couldnt shake it off my gp in windsor diagnosed a bacterial infection and gave me antibiotics these helped a bit but in late january i needed another course of antibiotics these seem to have done the trick was it really covid19  i dont think so the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the uk was in late january when two people from china fell ill in york it wasnt until a month later that the first cases of domestic transmission occurred note that although id been reporting on the outbreak in china by midjanuary the farthest afield id been in recent months was christmas in brussels  so i dont think i missed a story here  the first coronavirus case in the uk was not me but after that ive had no symptoms at all not a cough not a high temperature smell and taste normal and no aches and pains headaches diarrhoea conjunctivitis skin rash or any of the other possible warning signs listed by the world health organization  so when i pricked my finger i had no expectation that id get a positive result i was gobsmacked to be honest the test i did showed up positive for igg antibodies  these are the ones that form at least two weeks after an infection  i can tell you that having a positive test did not change my mindset  i still when i walk around assume that everybody i meet has coronavirus and that i have it i dont want to infect anyone and i dont want them to infect me  i am still an obsessive handwasher  having told the british public repeatedly about the importance of social distancing and hygiene i feel i need to set an example every public toilet i go to involves a demonstration of what i hope is perfect handwashing i dont actually sing happy birthday twice out loud but i do hum it in my head  image copyright emma russell  early on in the uk coronavirus epidemic there was much discussion of how antibody tests might eventually help get us out of lockdown in march the government was talking confidently of antibody tests being a gamechanger as they would help indicate who had been previously infected with covid19 and therefore was protected  unfortunately it was not that simple  the government bought 35 million fingerprick antibody tests but when they were evaluated by scientists in oxford they said none of those tested was sufficiently accurate  things have moved on a lot since then there are now several laboratory based antibody tests which seem fairly reliable  public health england has evaluated antibody tests from roche and abbott both require a blood draw so they are not fingerprick home tests the sample has to be sent to a laboratory for analysis  you can now also buy home antibody tests that you have to send to a laboratory these are quite accurate but you dont get an instant result  the accuracy of a test is based on its specificity and sensitivity  with coronavirus you want to ensure an antibody test is highly specific so that you dont get any false positives this could be dangerous as it would mean some people are told they have antibodies when they dont they might be lulled into a false sense of security take fewer precautions to guard against infection  both the roche and abbott tests are highly specific with near 100 accuracy this is very reassuring then we come to sensitivity this is the likelihood of a test giving a false negative the phe evaluation showed the roche test to be 87 sensitive with samples taken 21 days after symptom onset while the abbott test was 93 this means that some people who definitely had antibodies to coronavirus may get false negative results this is less important but it is nonetheless an error  both companies have said they can provide 10 million tests to the uk and the government has said antibody testing will be rolled out to frontline health workers from next week  but to what end if you have the roche or abbott test and get a positive result you can be pretty confident that you have had covid19 this will be especially useful to anyone who did not have the upthenose and backofthethroat swab test remember that is for current infection whether you have covid19 right now the antibody test tells you about past infection furthermore you need to wait several weeks for those antibodies to show up on a test  so thats great then a reliable positive antibody test means you are free from lockdown free to meet up with friends knowing you wont be infectious and are unlikely to spread the disease right  not so fast its just not that simple  there is no consensus on what a positive antibody test means for an individual some virologists ive spoken to reckon it will give you a degree of protection from coronavirus and in particular from severe symptoms but whether that will last for months or years is uncertain  with sars antibody levels started to disappear after two or three years  theres another complication current antibody tests dont distinguish between the presence of neutralising antibodies which would clear any new infection and nonneutralising antibodies  we also dont know the importance of tcell responses  another part of the immune system which doesnt involve antibodies  so having antibodies to coronavirus might not be the getoutoflockdown pass you might have assumed  everyone i have spoken to has said noone should change their behaviour based on a positive antibody test  so whats the use of rolling out antibody tests to healthcare workers  firstly it will really help build a picture of how many people in the uk have had coronavirus current estimates are sketchy and range from around 17 in london to 5 elsewhere in england thats a huge way off the 65 or thereabouts estimated to be required for herd immunity  if it turns out that people with antibodies are indeed immune  it will also give us the first really accurate picture of how many people have had coronavirus without knowing it socalled asymptomatic cases  people it seems like me  follow bbcferguswalsh on twitter']\n",

 it began with a wedding in egypts capital cairo on 6 march eight years after they first met 36yearold khaled and peri 35 married in front of their friends and families  a few days later the dubaibased couple left for cancún mexico with barely a worry in the world coronavirus seemed a distant concern as it had yet to fully spread across the globe  so while the couple were careful to avoid crowded places they say they never expected travel restrictions to affect their plans  but by the time they were returning home to the united arab emirates uae via turkey on 19 march the full scale was becoming apparent  while we were on the plane we had access to internet and then we started getting messages from people are you going to be able to get to dubai theres a new law theyre banning expats peri told the bbc  still as they were already in the air they assumed they would be allowed to travel but when they tried to board their connecting flight in istanbul they were told they could not board  the new rules had come into place just as they set off from mexico  the couple were left stranded at the airport for two days restrictions in turkey meant they were not allowed to leave and enter the city  whilst without a valid boarding pass they struggled to buy toiletries and clothes and were not even allowed to collect their luggage  image copyright peri image caption but when they tried to return they found themselves trapped  unable to enter the uae and with flights to egypt suspended they needed a plan  we decided to go on google and check all the countries that allowed egyptians without a visa and then check if they had flights peri said it appeared they only had one option the maldives  a set of islands with clear white sand and turquoise water in the indian ocean the maldives is renowned as one of the most beautiful places in the world khaled and peri had even considered heading there for their honeymoon instead of mexico  however on this occasion it was not the prospect of the beaches and snorkelling opportunities that excited the couple the most  i remember that moment we were let through immigration peri recalled we looked at each other and we were very happy that at least we would be sleeping in a bed as opposed to airport seats  khaled a telecoms engineer said laughing we were so happy to see our luggage  but once the immediate stress of finding a place to stay had been resolved new challenges dawned on them  we started realising there is a major financial burden our jobs  we wouldnt be able to perform them well we didnt pack our laptops said peri who works in media when youre on honeymoon you dont expect to be working much  image copyright khalid image caption their only option was to fly to a new honeymoon destination the maldives  on reaching their island resort the couple realised they were amongst only a handful of guests most of whom were waiting for flights home  as the others left the hotel shut down and the couple were shifted to another island where the same thing happened  they have spent the last month in a special isolation facility set up by the maldivian government at a resort on the island of olhuveli  they are grateful to the authorities who are charging a reduced rate and to the resort staff  theyre doing their best to actually make this a nicer experience for us so in the evening they play music they have a dj every day and sometimes we even feel bad because nobodys dancing khaled said  there are about 70 others at the resort many of whom are also honeymooners the only difference according to peri is that the others chose the maldives as their honeymoon destination  we didnt  there are close to 300 tourists left in the maldives which has now stopped new visitors from arriving but while there may be many worse places to spend in lockdown the couple are desperate to return to dubai  image copyright peri image caption it seems an idyllic spot to be trapped  but they still have to work  they say they have only managed to visit the beach a couple of times partly because of heavy rain during the current monsoon season and also because they are fasting during the holy month of ramadan  both are also back at work but struggle to connect via wifi to conference calls  but getting home is not straightforward as residents of the uae but not citizens they say they were not allowed onto flights returning others to the gulf  and while flying to egypt on a repatriation flight could have been an option it would have meant a 14day quarantine in a government facility  and still being unable to return to their home in dubai  they are calling on the uae authorities to help them and other residents who are stranded they have applied for approval to travel from the governments official portal but are yet to receive permission  and in any case no flights are currently available  it gets more stressful every time we read in the news that the airlines are postponing the date of going back into operation… well definitely do whatever were asked when it comes to quarantine whether at a hotel or selfquarantining home peri said  image copyright khalid and peri image caption their two month trip has been far from what they thought when they left for mexico  when it comes to the mounting cost of the trip the couple have decided not to do the maths until we go back because we dont know when its going to end  still they know others around the world are in far more difficult positions but they emphasise the trip has been far from an extended honeymoon  its always sad when youre in a resort and youre the last guests there and all the staff are waving byebye to you you feel bad for them too… that happened twice to us said khaled places like this should be full of people and good moments thats not the case right now  every time we tell people we are stuck in the maldives they laugh and theyre like its not the worst situation i wish i could be

station  elon musks company spacex is about to launch its space vehicle  the crew dragon  with astronauts onboard for the first time here we answer some common questions about the mission  why is a private company launching nasa astronauts  nasa has been planning to hand over the transport of crew to the international space station iss since the early 2000s after the columbia space shuttle broke up during its return to earth in 2003 the space agency focused on developing a replacement spaceship that could travel to the moon involving private firms in the transfer of crew and cargo to the iss was a necessary step to afford that programme in 2014 entrepreneur elon musks company spacex and aerospace giant boeing were announced as winners of a nasa contract for crew transport services spacex is launching its spacecraft first the crew dragon spacecraft will lift off on wednesday atop a falcon 9 rocket from floridas kennedy space center  what is spacex  spacex is an american company that provides commercial and government launch services on its falcon 9 and falcon heavy rockets entrepreneur elon musk founded the company in 2002 with the goal of reducing space transportation costs enabling the colonisation of mars spacex was the first private company to routinely return rocket stages to earth under propulsive power so they could be reflown rather than being discarded it has been conducting regular flights of cargo to the iss and will now aim to begin launching astronauts musks company is also developing a bigger spacecraft to carry humans  called starship  which could begin the process of settling mars  image copyright spacex image caption the crew dragon will seat a maximum of four during nasa missions to the iss  who is elon musk  born in south africa elon musk made more than 160m from the sale of online payment service paypal to ebay his desire to see humanity become a true spacefaring civilisation was a driving factor behind the founding of spacex but he

controversy his tweets have triggered lawsuits and led to him being forced out as the chairman of tesla though he remained as ceo  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption meet the man who inspired robert downey jrs take on iron man  why is the launch so important  since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 nasa has been paying russia tens of millions of dollars to launch its astronauts on the soyuz spacecraft the crew dragon launch from florida marks the first launch of humans from us soil in nine years as such it is seen as crucial for restoring american prestige in human spaceflight this will also be the first time a private company has launched astronauts into orbit  what is the crew dragon  the crew dragon is the spacecraft that will transport astronauts to the iss on wednesday it is a sleek evolution of the dragon spacecraft which was built to ferry cargo to the orbiting outpost the crew dragon is designed to carry a maximum of seven passengers but nasa flights will carry four with the rest of the space taken up by supplies it is equipped with thrusters that enable it to manoeuvre in space and will dock  or attach  to the space station under autonomous control unlike previous spacecraft designed for humans the crew cabin features touchscreen controls in place of physical buttons  image copyright nasa image caption a crew dragon during its first orbital test last year the craft was not carrying humans on that occasion  who are the astronauts flying to space  bob behnken and doug hurley are nasa astronauts they were selected in 2000 and have each flown to space twice on the space shuttle they are among the most experienced members of nasas astronaut corps and both trained as test pilots  which has been critical for putting the new spacecraft through its paces hurley has spent a total of 28 days and 11 hours in space while behnken has accumulated a total of 29 days and 12 hours including 37 hours of spacewalking time both men are also married to astronauts  image copyright reuters image caption bob behnken l and doug hurley arrived in florida on 20 may to prepare for launch  what are the astronauts there to do  spacecraft designed to carry astronauts have to go through a process that ensures they can operate safely this launch is essentially the final step in that validation process once in orbit behnken and hurley will test the crew dragons environmental control system the displays and controls and the manoeuvring thrusters they will monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station and will become members of the iss crew at the orbiting outpost they will continue performing tests on the crew dragon along with other tasks related to the space station when its time to return to earth the crew dragon will parachute down into the atlantic ocean the capsule and crew will then be recovered by a ship called go navigator  what if something goes wrong during the launch  the crew dragon has a builtin abort system designed to save the lives of its crew in the event of an emergency if theres a problem during liftoff such as a rocket engine cutoff the crew dragon will fire engines to propel the vehicle and its occupants free of the rocket the capsule will then parachute down to safety spacex successfully conducted a test of its inflight abort system on 19 january 2020  what about those spacesuits  the flight suits that behnken and hurley will wear in the capsule look very different to previous designs in stark contrast to the bulky pumpkincoloured suits and round helmets familiar from the space shuttle era spacexs suits are slimline white onepiece numbers with sleek 3dprinted helmets each one is custom made for the astronaut if they look like something from a science fiction movie thats probably because their look was devised by hollywood costume designer jose fernandez who has worked on the batman xmen and thor movies but the suits also have to be

measures were not the same as completely shutting the uk border to visitors  we are not shutting down completely we are not closing our borders she said  and asked about the prospect of foreign holidays this summer the home secretary added this is absolutely not about booking holidays we want to avoid a second wave and that is absolutely vital  socalled air bridges  agreements with countries that have low infection rates allowing tourists to travel without quarantining  will not be in place initially the government said  the new measure previously announced by prime minister boris johnson will be reviewed every three weeks once it is introduced  but airlines have said a quarantine requirement would effectively kill air travel  and one airport boss described the plans as a blunt tool  the government currently recommends international travel only when absolutely necessary and nobody should travel if they display any coronavirus symptoms  victoria bacon from abta the travel industry trade body told the bbc the government needs to come up with some wider more forward thinking strategies for the industry  theres a whole range of support not just financial that the government can put in place to start helping the sector and weve heard very little from them we really desperately need some help she said  what does the new system involve  passengers arriving in the uk will be required to fill out an online locator contact form  providing details of where they will spend their 14 days in selfisolation  the home office said the proposed accommodation will need to meet necessary requirements such as a hotel or a private address with friends or family  there will be a fine of £100 for failure to complete the form and the border force will have the power to refuse entry to nonuk citizens who do not comply with the new regulations  new arrivals will be told they may be contacted at any time during their quarantine and in england may be visited by public health authorities conducting spot checks  they will be told to avoid public transport and travel to their accommodation by car where possible and not to go out to buy food or other essentials where they can rely on others  in england a breach of selfisolation would be punishable by a £1000 fixed penalty notice or prosecution and an unlimited fine for persistent offenders  why now  analysis by helen catt political correspondent  the big question being asked about quarantine is why now  the government argues that it simply wouldnt have made enough of a difference while the virus was spreading widely within the uk  but it hasnt so far fully explained why such a blanket measure was not introduced much earlier in the outbreak before the virus took hold  people returning from wuhan city and hubei province in china were put into isolation for 14 days from late january  later those returning from italy were told to selfisolate  but the measure was not extended to travellers from every country  there are also questions about how this will work in practice and what it will mean for the travel industry which is already suffering huge losses  the home office has published a full list of exemptions to the new requirements  the list includes road haulage and freight workers medical professionals travelling to fight covid19 and seasonal farm workers who will selfisolate where they are working  ms patel said the new measures aim to keep the transmission rate down and prevent a devastating second wave  i fully expect the majority of people will do the right thing and abide by these measures but we will take enforcement action against the minority of people who endanger the safety of others she added  labours shadow home secretary nick thomassymonds said the party supported the

are now due to go on display  on 22 may 1945 a trio of oddlooking men were spotted by a patrol near a checkpoint in bremervörde northern germany  it was just a few weeks after world war two had ended but many nazis were still at large and there were fears some might try to regroup or escape  two of the men wearing smart long green overcoats were walking ahead of a third man the trailing figure sporting an eye patch looked broken and dishevelled the pair in front kept glancing back as if to make sure he was still there  they were taken to a checkpoint where british soldiers asked to see their papers they handed over the a4sized identity document german soldiers were given at the end of the conflict which listed their name rank date of birth and other information the third mans papers said he was a sergeant named heinrich hizinger  he must have hoped that the document and his lowly rank would mean he would pass through checkpoints he was wrong  on the document was an official stamp and british military intelligence had seen the same stamp and unit details being used by members of the ss who had been trying to flee and so word had gone out that anyone else with those details was to be detained  image copyright military intelligence museum image caption himmlers documents complete with false name and stamp  next morning the three men were taken to a detention camp  once there hizinger asked to see a senior officer although his cover was still intact he must have feared it would not last long and perhaps hoped he could bargain his way out of the situation so he took off his eye patch and calmly revealed who he really was  he was heinrich himmler the man who had been head of the ss and a key architect of the holocaust  after hitlers death in his bunker this made him one of the mostwanted nazis still alive and a man responsible for many of the worst crimes of the third reich  the british team began to question him to confirm he was who he said  image copyright getty images image caption himmler alongside adolf hitler  a few hours later a medical officer capt wells was told to check himmler as he came to look inside his mouth he saw a small bluetipped object hidden in his cheek  as capt wells tried to pull it out himmler struggled with the doctor pulled his head away and crushed the object between his teeth it was a cyanide capsule he was dead within minutes  himmler had been given away by a fake stamp that his own people had placed in a document the incriminating papers remained hidden for 75 years but they can now be seen for the first time after being donated to the military intelligence museum in shefford bedfordshire  and alongside the papers are a slightly more bizarre item  the braces that himmler was wearing when he was captured  souvenirhunting was common and many of himmlers personal items were snapped up one of the sergeants who carried out the original arrest got hold of himmlers slippers someone else got his shaving foam and razor blades  in the case of the documents they were recently donated by the great niece of lt col sidney noakes  image copyright military intelligence museum image caption lt col sidney noakes is thought to have interrogated himmler before his death  noakes born in 1905 was a lawyer who joined the intelligence corps in 1943 but was seconded to mi5 much of what he did at mi5 remains shrouded in secrecy but after the war he returned to his career as a lawyer eventually ending up a county court judge he died in 1993  so how did he end up with the papers  documents detailing the arrest say a gentle interrogation of himmler by mi5 officers took place before the final medical examination these officers by convention would not have been named and so it is not certain who they were  the logical assumption is that he was one of the two mi5 interrogators says bill steadman curator of the military intelligence museum i cant think of any other way he could have got them  he believes it is possible noakes was given permission to keep the documents by his superiors once any intelligence value had been extracted  the objects stayed with noakes and his family until they were recently donated and they will be on display once the museum reopens  they are more than just a curiosity but also explain how a senior nazi was caught  without this damning stamp on the document it is possible that himmler may have been able to pass through the system unnoticed and escape as did many other wanted nazis says bill steadman  what appeals to me most about this story is that the germans themselves made his unmasking an absolute certainty']\n",

graphics says jason ronald head of program management for the gaming console xbox  the technique simulates a threedimensional image by calculating each ray of light and promises stunning lighting effects with realistic reflections and shadows  the method finds where it bounces collects information about what those objects are then uses it to lay down a pixel and compose a scene  while the techniques have been around for a long time we just havent had processing power to deliver all of that in real time mr ronald says  in hollywood special effects have used ray tracing for a decade for an important sequence computers could churn overnight for a single frame  to do this for games in real time you need to condense that to 160th of a second processing speed has now caught up to the task  image copyright nvidia image caption ray tracing creates more realistic light and shadows  tech company nvidia announced last year their latest graphics processing units gpus will handle realtime ray tracing  working with nvidia microsoft developed a ray tracing update to windows 10  microsoft and sony have announced their upcoming consoles the xbox series x and the playstation 5 will have ray tracing capabilities both of these systems are built on advanced micro devices amd hardware  and now the tech is being incorporated into some of the worlds most popular games  minecraft which first appeared in 2009 allows players to construct vast intricate structures developed by swedish game studio mojang it currently is the bestselling video game in history  minecrafts makers released an early raytracing version of their game on 16 april a general release will follow near the end of the year  it looks very different from the traditional rendering mode and it looks better says jarred walton hardware editor at pc gamer  the big problem he says will be price barriers for now the only way you can play it is with a pc that has a graphics card that costs at least 300 £240 he says  image copyright nvidia image caption ray tracing requires expensive processor chips  until now developers used another technique called rasterisation  it first appeared in the mid1990s is extremely quick and represents 3d shapes in triangles and polygons the one nearest the viewer determines the pixel  then programmers have to employ tricks to simulate what lighting looks like that includes lightmaps which calculate the brightness of surfaces ahead of time says mr ronald  but these hacks have limitations theyre static so fall apart when you move around for example you might zoom in on a mirror and find that your reflection has disappeared  more technology of business  programmable shaders started appearing around 2001 they did a much better job at 3d lighting tasks but required much more computational power  if we put all that into one game the most amazing processor in the world wouldve gone just no its too much says ben archard senior rendering programmer at maltabased 4a games developers behind a 2019 postapocalyptic game called metro exodus  there were ways around that if a programmer wanted to simulate the hazy light coming through fog instead of working out all the points they could just calculate a sample of them these are called stochastic statistical or monte carlo approaches  image copyright mojang image caption underwater scenes are kasia swicas favourite use of ray tracing  but with these workarounds pretty quickly you lose that realism in a scene observes kasia swica minecrafts senior program manager based in seattle  ray tracing does better with realistic realtime shadows or reflections lurking in water or glass  my favourite thing to do with ray tracing is to go underwater says miss swica  you get really realistic

will be the main tasks in the next five to seven years of computer graphics at least says mr ronald  in the meantime games companies will use other techniques to make games look slicker  earlier this month epic games the makers of fortnite released its latest game architecture the unreal engine 5  it uses a combination of techniques including a library of objects that can be imported into games as

 but chancellor rishi sunak said things would be worse without government aid  the governments independent forecaster the office for budget responsibility obr has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach £298bn more than five times the estimate at the time of the march budget  jonathan athow deputy national statistician at the ons described aprils figure as pretty much unprecedented it said the cost of furlough schemes alone was £14bn in april  borrowing now is about six times what it was in april last year so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances mr athow told the bbc  he added it was impossible to forecast the current years public finances because of the high amounts of uncertainty tax receipts have fallen heavily as the treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments the amount received from vat in april was negative with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments  how much does the government spend  more than £880bn was spent on services such as defence policing the nhs schools and welfare benefits in the last financial year  most of this comes from taxes which totalled about £840bn last year  usually the government spends more money than it has it borrows money by selling bonds  a promise to repay the money with interest  the total debt has increased over time it is currently £19 trillion  about £28000 per person in the uk  although the debt in cash terms has gone up money raised from taxes has risen too which means the debt can be manageable  meanwhile borrowing by the state in march 2020 has been revised up by £117bn to £147bn the ons said  it said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and national insurance contributions  the surge in borrowing comes after chancellor rishi sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown  after publication of the figures mr sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support the cost to the economy and peoples livelihoods would be much worse  our top priority is to support people jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible he said  thats why weve taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme grants loans and tax cuts  buy now  worry later  for the past decade the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping aiming for position where it could cover daytoday spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit  but then the crisis hit  and as the chancellor claims the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over to prevent an even bigger economic disaster it was worth ripping up the rulebook for he said  however the bills are mounting just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped  this years deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the second world war  and that hole needs plugging  for the moment the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets through bonds effectively ious  but there is a limit to how much it can do so  ultimately economists say taxes will have to rise or spending cut  the emergency raft will have a price tag which we cant escape  but the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery and if he opts for tax hikes hell risk breaking some election promises  britain is poorer  the scale of the economic consequences was underlined on friday in separate retail sales data from the ons these showed that high street sales crashed last month as shops closed for the lockdown  it was also announced on friday that a mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the pandemic has been extended for another three months  as a result of the jump in borrowing total public sector debt rose to £1888bn at the end of april  £1184bn higher than april 2019  former chancellor george osborne told the bbc we have to come to terms with the fact that britain is poorer and the economy is smaller than it would have been  asked if the economy would bounce back he said bounce is the wrong word but it will recover  ruth gregory an economist at capital economics described aprils borrowing as alarmingly high but added that a small easing of the lockdown from 13 may probably meant the government would not have to borrow as much this month  and despite the pressure on public finances charlie mccurdy a researcher at the resolution foundation said there were no signs the government was struggling to raise money on the financial markets  record low interest rates mean the uks higher debt burden should remain more than manageable he said']\n",

graphics says jason ronald head of program management for the gaming console xbox  the technique simulates a threedimensional image by calculating each ray of light and promises stunning lighting effects with realistic reflections and shadows  the method finds where it bounces collects information about what those objects are then uses it to lay down a pixel and compose a scene  while the techniques have been around for a long time we just havent had processing power to deliver all of that in real time mr ronald says  in hollywood special effects have used ray tracing for a decade for an important sequence computers could churn overnight for a single frame  to do this for games in real time you need to condense that to 160th of a second processing speed has now caught up to the task  image copyright nvidia image caption ray tracing creates more realistic light and shadows  tech company nvidia announced last year their latest graphics processing units gpus will handle realtime ray tracing  working with nvidia microsoft developed a ray tracing update to windows 10  microsoft and sony have announced their upcoming consoles the xbox series x and the playstation 5 will have ray tracing capabilities both of these systems are built on advanced micro devices amd hardware  and now the tech is being incorporated into some of the worlds most popular games  minecraft which first appeared in 2009 allows players to construct vast intricate structures developed by swedish game studio mojang it currently is the bestselling video game in history  minecrafts makers released an early raytracing version of their game on 16 april a general release will follow near the end of the year  it looks very different from the traditional rendering mode and it looks better says jarred walton hardware editor at pc gamer  the big problem he says will be price barriers for now the only way you can play it is with a pc that has a graphics card that costs at least 300 £240 he says  image copyright nvidia image caption ray tracing requires expensive processor chips  until now developers used another technique called rasterisation  it first appeared in the mid1990s is extremely quick and represents 3d shapes in triangles and polygons the one nearest the viewer determines the pixel  then programmers have to employ tricks to simulate what lighting looks like that includes lightmaps which calculate the brightness of surfaces ahead of time says mr ronald  but these hacks have limitations theyre static so fall apart when you move around for example you might zoom in on a mirror and find that your reflection has disappeared  more technology of business  programmable shaders started appearing around 2001 they did a much better job at 3d lighting tasks but required much more computational power  if we put all that into one game the most amazing processor in the world wouldve gone just no its too much says ben archard senior rendering programmer at maltabased 4a games developers behind a 2019 postapocalyptic game called metro exodus  there were ways around that if a programmer wanted to simulate the hazy light coming through fog instead of working out all the points they could just calculate a sample of them these are called stochastic statistical or monte carlo approaches  image copyright mojang image caption underwater scenes are kasia swicas favourite use of ray tracing  but with these workarounds pretty quickly you lose that realism in a scene observes kasia swica minecrafts senior program manager based in seattle  ray tracing does better with realistic realtime shadows or reflections lurking in water or glass  my favourite thing to do with ray tracing is to go underwater says miss swica  you get really realistic reflections and refractions and neat shafts of light coming through as well she says  with lockdowns around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic the need for people to feel close while isolated

were in the same place together he says  so coronavirus will drive demand and progress agrees frank azor chief gaming solutions architect at amd  image copyright unreal image caption impressive lighting is possible even without ray tracing  one fiendish problem for ray tracing has involved how shaders can call on other shaders if two rays interact says andrew goossen a technical fellow at microsoft who works on the xbox series x  gpus work on problems like rays in parallel making parallel processes talk to each other is complex  working out technical problems for improving ray tracing will be the main tasks in the next five to seven years of computer graphics at least says mr ronald  in the meantime games companies will use other techniques to make games look slicker  earlier this month epic games the makers of fortnite released its latest game architecture the unreal engine 5  it uses a combination of techniques including a library of objects that can be imported into games as hundreds of millions of polygons and a hierarchy of details treating large and small objects differently to save on its demands on processor resources  for most game makers such hacks and tricks will

qualified contact tracer  what is not clear is just how well trained most of the people undertaking this vital task in the uk will be  a contact tracer does the detective work of calling up people known to be infected with a disease and working out where they have been in recent days and who they might have met  the idea is then to track down those with whom they have been in close proximity and tell them to go into quarantine  with the government recruiting 25000 contact tracers to be at the heart of its new test track and trace strategy we wanted to experience the sort of training they will receive  public health england told us that was not possible  so instead i enrolled in the course offered by americas johns hopkins university in conjunction with the online training platform coursera  the course which tens of thousands of people have taken consists of a series of video lectures and multiple choice quizzes  image copyright john hopkins university  it took me an intense eight hours to complete and i emerged with enormous respect for the discipline  as the lecturer put it on the very last page contact tracing is a complex activity which requires attention to detail and problemsolving skills  you bet it does  what became clear is that although technology such as the bluetooth apps being tested around the world can help human skills are vital  the final section  which took me two hours to complete  is all about how you talk effectively to the people you are trying to help  so what did i learn  lessons learned  i know much more about the signs and symptoms of the disease  for example that a loss of taste and smell is reported by around a third of all patients despite the uk only just adding this to the recognised list of symptoms  i have learned that of all the places where the disease can spread most easily care homes where vulnerable people are in close contact are right at the top of the list  i now know more about the difference between isolation and quarantine  although the us and uk guidelines are not the same  but the key message is how small the window is to alert people who may have been in contact with the infection before they spread it further  and so how swiftly contact tracers need to act  the slide below tells the story  image copyright john hopkins university  once someone has been in contact with an infected person there are five days of incubation before they themselves may become infectious  so it is vital that they receive a warning as quickly as possible  stephanie hare a data ethicist who also took the course says the other lesson the uk could learn is how important speedy testing is  unfortunately the united kingdom does not have a testing capability that would allow our population at scale to report symptoms on the first day we experience them get tested and get the result back within 24 hours she said  communication  image copyright getty images image caption can you tell your friends if you find out that someone with the virus was in their favourite bar  having learned a lot about covid19 and the principles of contact tracing the course then took me through the process of making a call to someone who had either received a positive test or been in contact with someone infected with the virus  there was great stress on the importance of communicating clearly but also on establishing a rapport with people receiving worrying news  much of the teaching came in the form of dramatised phone calls  we met poor larry with the hacking cough and then annette the choir member he had probably infected  we admired the empathy shown by tracer amy  i hear you this is a difficult time  while chuckling at the brusque ineptitude of her colleague drew who kept interrupting and upsetting larry and annette  ethics  any contact tracers employed in the uk will be dealing with some very sensitive information often working from home on their own computers  the johns hopkins course outlines the ethical challenges involved in contact tracing  the quiz at the end of the section featured some easy questions if your subject tells you that one of his recent contacts was his girlfriend should you tell his wife err no  but what about the contact telling you she had spent a lot of time in a pub where you know your friends and family hang out  you cannot tell them they may be in danger said the instructor  technology  while this course is about oldfashioned manual contact tracing  the technique used to combat the ebola outbreak and other epidemics  it does also run through some of the technology tools which could help  these include the bluetooth contact tracing apps currently being developed in a number of countries including the uk  given the small window available to trace contacts it says automating the process could make it faster and more effective but there is also a warning that such apps need high takeup to be effective  and should be integrated with the testing and public health systems meaning contacts get calls from a human tracer as well as pings on their phones  so for all the talk about privacy being baked into apps users could still end up getting a call from a tracer asking some deeply personal questions  overall the course gives a detailed and inspiring but also realistic view of what contact tracing can achieve  in normal circumstances out of lockdown someone with covid19 will infect between two and three other people  if that can be reduced to just one person then the epidemic could be brought under control  how does it compare with the uk  there have been reports that the training process for new contact tracers in the uk is pretty sketchy  a few powerpoint slides and some scripts for callers to follow  isabel oliver who is overseeing the contact tracing programme for public health england told me she was not familiar with the johns hopkins course but was happy with how recruits here were being trained  our training is based on the requirements for our own programme she said  were very confident that weve got a good and robust system in place its been tried and tested  originally the government indicated that the bluetooth contact tracing app currently being tested on the isle of wight would be key to efforts to control the virus once lockdown was eased  now it is clear that an army of human contact tracers will be first into battle so the quality of their training will be crucial']\n",

down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed  now in detailed analysis researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of co2  theyve calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97 of global emissions  during the peak of the crisis in early april daily emissions dropped by 17 compared to the previous year meaning around 17 million tonnes less co2 were emitted every day  the key to the fall has been cars surface transport emissions have declined by 43 the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined  while the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact it only accounts for 10 of the decrease during the pandemic  china has been responsible for the biggest drop followed by the us europe and india  if some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year then global emissions will likely drop by 7  if prepandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by midjune the annual fall would be around 4  but the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound especially on the roads could see a carbon surge  analysis  roger harrabin environment analyst  lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants too one of the uks leading experts prof frank kelly from kings college london said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised  fully two years before us authorities exposed the scandal  he told radio 4s the life scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road  prof kelly said he reported it to the department for environment food and rural affairs defra but they didnt publish his findings he said work undertaken subsequently in the us led to legal action against car makers that had installed defeat devices to fool regulators  the government didnt deny the account a spokesperson said we are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our clean air strategy has been commended by the world health organization as an example for the rest of the world to follow  meanwhile on the covid19 crisis he said levels of the pollutant no2 had fallen by up to 60 in london since the fall in traffic under lockdown  levels of another pollutant sooty particles remained at harmful concentrations  a big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before once everybody goes back said prof corinne le quéré from the university of east anglia who led the analysis  the researchers say that fundamental systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change  when it comes to transportation there are huge opportunities according to prof le quéré  she says that after the global financial crisis in 2008 some governments like china us and germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables  image copyright getty images image caption airlines have been hit hard economically but the slowdown in flying hasnt hugely impacted emissions  here now in 2020 were very close to the same situation in electric mobility she told bbc news  battery prices have come down we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies  so if these two things can align then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow  grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change  a letter signed by 155 major companies representing 24 trillion £196 trillion in market capitalisation calls for a netzero emissions response to the covid crisis  corporations including carlsberg iberdrola edf

forward for transportation scientists believe  the authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action they point to the fact that while emissions of co2 may be

transport minister nitin gadkari said in a recent interview the northern state of uttar pradesh which has a population the size of brazil is already forming an economic task force to attract firms keen to ditch china  india is also readying a pool of land twice the size of luxembourg to offer companies that want to move manufacturing out of china and has reached out to 1000 american multinationals bloomberg reported  this outreach has been an ongoing process deepak bagla chief executive of invest india the governments national investment promotion agency told the bbc covid will only accelerate the process of derisking from china for many of these companies  the usindia business council usibc a powerful lobby group that works to enhance investment flows between india and the

usibc and the former assistant secretary of state for south and central asian affairs in the us department of state told the bbc  companies that already have some manufacturing in india may be earlier movers in reducing output in plants in china and scaling up in production in india  image copyright getty images image caption indian government agencies are trying to woo multinationals from the us  but things are still at an evaluation stage and decisions are unlikely to be made in a hurry she added  in an environment where global balance sheets are fractured relocating entire supply chains is easier said than done  many of these companies are facing severe cash and capital constraints because of the pandemic and will therefore be very cautious before making quick moves independent economist rupa subramanya said  according to rahul jacob a longtime china watcher and former financial times bureau chief in hong kong the indian government putting together land banks is a step in the right direction but large companies are unlikely to move their operations just because land is made available  production lines and supply chains are far more sticky than most people seem to understand it is very difficult to pull them apart overnight he said  china offers integrated infrastructure like large ports and highways top quality labour and sophisticated logistics all of which are critical factors to meet strict deadlines that international companies operate on  image copyright getty images image caption can india match chinas integrated infrastructure capabilities  another reason india might not be the obvious choice for global multinationals is because it isnt well integrated with major global supply chains  last year delhi pulled out of a crucial multilateral trade

exporters to benefit from tarifffree access to destination markets or offer reciprocity to its trading partners  why would i make something that i want to sell to singapore in india being connected in trade agreements institutionally is as important as offering competitive prices parag khanna author of the future is asian told the bbc  regional integration is particularly crucial he believes as global trade begins to follow the sell where you make model where companies socalled nearsource rather than outsource production and bring it closer to demand  indias volatile relationship with foreign direct investment fdi and uneven regulation is also something that continues to bother global companies  from prohibiting ecommerce companies to sell nonessential items and tweaking fdi rules to disallow easier capital flows from neighbouring countries the fear is that india has used the pandemic to build protectionist walls around itself  in a recent address to the nation indian prime minister narendra modi made be vocal for local his rallying cry new stimulus proposals meanwhile have increased thresholds for foreign companies bidding for indian contracts  the more that india can improve regulatory stability the better its chances of persuading more global businesses to establish hubs in india says mr biswal  so then who if not india  as things stand vietnam bangladesh south

before the trade war began us goods imports from vietnam have soared by more than 50 and those from taiwan by 30 according to calculations made by the south china morning post newspaper  india is seen to have lost out because it failed to create conditions allowing multinationals to supply not only the local market but also to use the country as a production base to export to the world  in recent weeks several states have begun making moves to address some concerns around the ease of doing business  prime among them being making contentious changes to indias archaic labour laws put in place to reduce exploitation  uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh states for instance have suspended significant labour protections exempting factories from even maintaining basic requirements like cleanliness ventilation lighting and toilets  image copyright getty images image caption some indian states have stripped away laws that gave labourers basic protections  the intention is to improve the investment climate and attract global capital  but such decisions could become counterproductive and hurt rather than help says mr jacob international companies would be very wary about this they have strict codes of conduct on labour environment and safety standards for suppliers  the 2013 collapse of the rana plaza garment factory in bangladesh that supplied retailers like walmart was a turning point it forced bangladesh to significantly improve factory infrastructure and safety to clinch more investment he cautions  india has to follow better standards these are white board ideas drafted on

nowhere near as wealthy as they thought they were  this hits western englishspeaking universities particularly hard they tend to charge even domestic students large tuition fees and make money out of onsite catering and accommodation on top of that  they also tend to charge foreign students a lot more making them a huge source of income for many universities in the uk for example undergraduate students from outside the uk and the eu can be charged annual tuition fees as high as £58600 instead of the standard £9000  so while globalisation for many means importing cheaper manufactured goods

for education he says  they have been doing just that not least because many developing countries dont have the same quality of tertiary education as developed ones this means that students who study abroad emerge with a prestigious degree a second language and lots of contacts and friends it has proved a price worth paying for millions  the big winners in this regard have been the us the uk and

laboratory and continues to receive funding from the us state department  it attempts to hide a persons location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several nodes  which in this context means using volunteers pcs and computer servers as connection points  encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity  to the website that ultimately receives the request it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain  known as an exit node  rather than the person responsible  since the beginning of the global pandemic marketplaces on the dark web have seen a rise in covid19 related products and services soughtafter n95 masks gowns gloves and the drug chloroquine have all been listed on these marketplaces last month security software firm intsights found blood allegedly belonging to recovered coronavirus patients was even being offered for sale  criminals hope a heightened sense of fear will make people rush to buy these products and as a result these items are not cheap an australian institute of criminology report found the average fake vaccine was being sold for about 370 £300 while one supposedly sourced from china was selling for between 1015000 £812000  one of the reasons for the rise in such sales may be because many fraudsters are having to turn from their normal methods of making money on the dark web  such as selling fake flights booked using stolen airmiles  because these industries are currently dormant  many criminals also see an opportunity  as the majority of people are working from home there is a greater chance of lax cyber security in place  there was suddenly a huge shift on the dark web of talking about vulnerabilities in collaboration software when they realised people were going to be working from home says intsights chief security officer etay maor  more technology of business  phishing scams have also been on the rise these are where fraudsters pretend to be a different organisation or person by email hoping the person will provide some login details or personal data which can then be used to steal money or someones identity  the phishing attacks started with those pretending to be from the nhs and then extended to secondary organisations that are related to covid19 like banks or hmrc emailing about funding grants or being furloughed says javvad malik security advocate at training company knowbe4  now there are covid19 related phishing templates making their way into all of the

for its initial purpose  speaking to others anonymously on forums  according to mr malik these forums have often been used to fuel conspiracy theories around the virus  conspiracies about 5g being the vehicle of this virus or bioweaponry or that bill gates is the man behind it tend to crop up on the dark web he says  as social media companies and other news outlets crack down on misinformation many

the original sites are blocked by governments or states for instance  netblocks a digital rights advocacy group says that many countries have cut access to the web in different ways as they seek to control the flow of information about the coronavirus outbreak  two ransomware groups had said they would not attack any hospitals or healthcare organisations during the pandemic but as foreign secretary dominic raab outlined in a recent press briefing there is evidence that criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations that are responding to the pandemic

government borrowing surged to £62bn in april the highest monthly figure on record after heavy spending to ease the coronavirus crisis  it means the deficit  the difference between spending and tax income  was larger last month than forecast for the whole year at the time of the budget  the data from the office for national statistics revealed the soaring cost of support such as furlough schemes  but chancellor rishi sunak said things would be worse without government aid  the governments independent forecaster the office for budget responsibility obr has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach £298bn more than five times the estimate at the time of the march budget  jonathan athow deputy national statistician at the ons described aprils figure as pretty much unprecedented it said the cost of furlough schemes alone was £14bn in april  borrowing now is about six times what it was in april last year so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances mr athow told the bbc  he added it was impossible to forecast the current years public finances because of the high amounts of uncertainty tax receipts have fallen heavily as the treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments the amount received from vat in april was negative with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments  how much does the government spend  more than £880bn was spent on services such as defence policing the nhs schools and welfare benefits in the last financial year  most of this comes from taxes which totalled about £840bn last year  usually the government spends more money than it has it borrows money by selling bonds  a promise to repay the money with interest  the total debt has increased over time it is currently £19 trillion  about £28000 per person in the uk  although the debt in cash terms has gone up money raised from taxes has risen too which means the debt can be manageable  meanwhile borrowing by the state in march 2020 has been revised up by £117bn to £147bn the ons said  it said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and national insurance contributions  the surge in borrowing comes after chancellor rishi sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown  after publication of the figures mr sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support the cost to the economy and peoples livelihoods would be much worse  our top priority is to support people jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible he said  thats why weve taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme grants loans and tax cuts  buy now  worry later  for the past decade the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping aiming for position where it could cover daytoday spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit  but then the crisis hit  and as the chancellor claims the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over to prevent an even bigger economic disaster it was worth ripping up the rulebook for he said  however the bills are mounting just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped  this years deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the second world war  and that hole needs plugging  for the moment the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets through bonds effectively ious  but there is a limit to how much it can do so  ultimately economists say taxes will have to rise or spending cut  the emergency raft will have a price tag which we cant escape  but the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery and if he opts for tax hikes hell risk breaking some election promises  britain is poorer  the scale of the economic consequences was underlined on friday in separate retail sales data from the ons these showed that high street sales crashed last month as shops closed for the lockdown  it was also announced on friday that a mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the pandemic has been extended for another three months  as a result of the jump in borrowing total public sector debt rose to £1888bn at the end of april  £1184bn higher than april 2019  former chancellor george osborne told the bbc we have to come to terms with the fact that britain is poorer and the economy is smaller than it would have been  asked if the economy would bounce back he said bounce is the wrong word but it will recover  ruth gregory an economist at capital economics described aprils borrowing as alarmingly high but added that a small easing of the lockdown from 13 may probably meant the government would not have to borrow as much this month

qualified contact tracer  what is not clear is just how well trained most of the people undertaking this vital task in the uk will be  a contact tracer does the detective work of calling up people known to be infected with a disease and working out where they have been in recent days and who they might have met  the idea is then to track down those with whom they have been in close proximity and tell them to go into quarantine  with the government recruiting 25000 contact tracers to be at the heart of its new test track and trace strategy we wanted to experience the sort of training they will receive  public health england told us that was not possible  so instead i enrolled in the course offered by americas johns hopkins university in conjunction with the online training platform coursera  the course which tens of thousands of people have taken consists of a series of video lectures and multiple choice quizzes  image copyright john hopkins university  it took me an intense eight hours to complete and i emerged with enormous respect for the discipline  as the lecturer put it on the very last page contact tracing is a complex activity which requires attention to detail and problemsolving skills  you bet it does  what became clear is that although technology such as the bluetooth apps being tested around the world can help human skills are vital  the final section  which took me two hours to complete  is all about how you talk effectively to the people you are trying to help  so what did i learn  lessons learned  i know much more about the signs and symptoms of the disease  for example that a loss of taste and smell is reported by around a third of all patients despite the uk only just adding this to the recognised list of symptoms  i have learned that of all the places where the disease can spread most easily care homes where vulnerable people are in close contact are right at the top of the list  i now know more about the difference between isolation and quarantine  although the us and uk guidelines are not the same  but the key message is how small the window is to alert people who may have been in contact with the infection before they spread it further  and so how swiftly contact tracers need to act  the slide below tells the story  image copyright john hopkins university  once someone has been in contact with an infected person there are five days of incubation before they themselves may become infectious  so it is vital that they receive a warning as quickly as possible  stephanie hare a data ethicist who also took the course says the other lesson the uk could learn is how important speedy testing is  unfortunately the united kingdom does not have a testing capability that would allow our population at scale to report symptoms on the first day we experience them get tested and get the result back within 24 hours she said  communication  image copyright getty images image caption can you tell your friends if you find out that someone with the virus was in their favourite bar  having learned a lot about covid19 and the principles of contact tracing the course then took me through the process of making a call to someone who had either received a positive test or been in contact with someone infected with the virus  there was great stress on the importance of communicating clearly but also on establishing a rapport with people receiving worrying news  much of the teaching came in the form of dramatised phone calls  we met poor larry with the hacking cough and then annette the choir member he had probably infected  we admired the empathy shown by tracer amy  i hear you this is a difficult time  while chuckling at the brusque ineptitude of her colleague drew who kept interrupting and upsetting larry and annette  ethics  any contact tracers employed in the uk will be dealing with some very sensitive information often working from home on their own computers  the johns hopkins course outlines the ethical challenges involved in contact tracing  the quiz at the end of the section featured some easy questions if your subject tells you that one of his recent contacts was his girlfriend should you tell his wife err no  but what about the contact telling you she had spent a lot of time in a pub where you know your friends and family hang out  you cannot tell them they may be in danger said the instructor  technology  while this course is about oldfashioned manual contact tracing  the technique used to combat the ebola outbreak and other epidemics  it does also run through some of the technology tools which could help  these include the bluetooth contact tracing apps currently being developed in a number of countries including the uk  given the small window available to trace contacts it says automating the process could make it faster and more effective but there is also a warning that such apps need high takeup to be effective  and should be integrated with the testing and public health systems meaning contacts get calls from a human tracer as well as pings on their phones  so for all the talk about privacy being baked into apps users could still end up getting a call from a tracer asking some deeply personal questions  overall the course gives a detailed and inspiring but also realistic view of what contact tracing can achieve  in normal circumstances out of lockdown someone with covid19 will infect between two and three other people  if that can be reduced to just one person then the epidemic could be brought under control  how does it compare with the uk  there have been reports that the training process for new contact tracers in the uk is pretty sketchy  a few powerpoint slides and some scripts for callers to follow  isabel oliver who is overseeing the contact tracing programme for public health england told me she was not familiar with the johns hopkins course but was happy with how recruits here were being trained  our training is based on the requirements for our own programme she said  were very confident that weve got a good and robust system in place its been tried and tested  originally the government indicated that the bluetooth contact tracing app currently being tested on the isle of wight would be key to efforts to control the virus once lockdown was eased  now it is clear that an army of human contact tracers

phased approach to opening the nontourism economy or kamaʻaina local economy the plan reopened auto dealerships car washes and pet grooming services in may while waiting until june to consider reopening higherrisk businesses such as gyms museums and theaters  the governor also confirmed that the mandatory 14day quarantine for all arrivals would stay in place through june the finer details of how the tourism economy – bars hotels convention centers – will be reopened have yet to be released but one idea being discussed is waiving the quarantine for visitors if they take a covid19 test

find a way to do it as safely as we can”  facebook twitter pinterest hawaii’s governor david ige at the state capitol in january photograph audrey mcavoyap  nearly 240000 people have signed up for unemployment since the beginning of march according to hawaii’s department of labor and industrial relations the pandemic unemployment assistance program which opened in may for gig workers and selfemployed individuals has received 28000 applications the state’s outdated unemployment system created a huge backlog in applications forcing the recently jobless to wait weeks or for some more than a month for their first payments  the governor has extended the quarantine until the end of june which has helped bring the number of arrivals to hawaii from the usual 30000 to less than 1000 most days the mandatory 14day quarantine requires that everyone arriving in the state or traveling between islands must go directly from the airport to their home or hotel during the quarantine period all food must be delivered those who break quarantine face a maximum fine of 5000 andor imprisonment of up to one year  local lawmakers have budgeted 36m for airport temperature cameras which the governor said at a press conference on monday would be part of the future screening process for arrivals to hawaii’s airports “it does allow us to identify those who are most sick in a way that can be less intrusive than other screening methods” ige said the white house has advocated for their use although the centers for disease control and prevention has said that thermal screening airport passengers is not a particularly effective detection strategy  “it’s a lot of money to set up a system that makes people feel better but actually doesn’t catch many of the active cases that are coming

trying to prevent people who have active coronavirus infections from getting on planes”  maintaining low rates of covid19 will probably encourage visitors to come to the state as they will think of hawaii as a safe place it will also make residents who are weary of visitors – a handful were caught breaking quarantine after posting pictures of themselves on the beach – more confident about allowing tourism to return  testing contact tracing and isolation methods also needed to be bolstered before the state allowed tourists to come back said la croix in early may the state’s department of health said it was increasing the number of trained contact tracers who will help track the people an infected person may have come in contact with in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus

where he has more followers than any other politician by far”  according to a democratic strategist familiar with obama’s thinking the former president is eager to campaign for democrats “up and down the ballot” in 2020 he plans to follow the lead of the biden campaign as well as that of the main democratic campaign arms – the democratic congressional campaign committee the democratic senatorial campaign committee and other umbrella organizations  obama was an active surrogate to boost democrats in the 2018 midterm elections but since then has taken a more restrained approach to the national

coronavirus pandemic had “finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing” obama didn’t mention trump by name but the speech was widely regarded

important for someone like obama as well “i’m a big believer that you need to do both in the bulk of these battleground states”  there have been moments during the last three years when democrats had wondered why obama didn’t speak out more against trump or weigh in more during the democratic primary that’s actually an asset now and adds weight to when obama does speak out said guy cecil who runs

appearing together so far and he should keep doing that rather than just focusing on going headtohead with trump  “i think he if continues to remind people about competency and progress under his

“honorary black man” at a private dinner in march but his mistreatment of black people verbally and politically is decades old and is a reflection of the democratic party in general  throughout biden’s career he has boasted about his ability to bridge partisan divides by sacrificing the needs of black people and poor people in the name of “compromise” for the last 30 years biden has repeatedly talked about freezing cutting or raising the age for social security and other benefits – as much as 2tn one time his response to concerns that these cuts would hurt the poor “we’re going to do lots of hard things … we might as well do this”  social security is an important program for black people especially as we age among african americans receiving social security 35 of elderly married couples and 58 of unmarried elderly persons relied on it for 90 or more of their income the reliance is not due to laziness or spending habits – people of color and white people make similar choices and contributions to retirement – but due to racism lack of workplace retirement plans and barriers to accessing highpaying jobs  “they know where my heart is” biden has said of black voters  but do we  senator kamala harris was severely scrutinized for her treatment of poor black women as a prosecutor – yet biden’s criminal justice record makes harris look like thurgood marshall biden authored and successfully passed the 30bn 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act besides putting 100000 additional police officers in the streets the crime bill distributed funding for new prison construction encouraged prosecutors to charge children as adults and even added the death penalty for 28 new areas including drugrelated offenses pushing for further criminalization then senator biden argued that george hw bush’s crime plan did not go far enough because it did not “include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs not enough prosecutors to convict them not enough judges to sentence them and not enough prison cells to put them away for a long time” an older black generation fought through jim crow only for biden to help make sure that their children and grandchildren lived through a new jim crow  on the house floor biden compared his criminal justice approach to richard nixon’s law and order stance “i would say ‘lock the sobs up’” black people were arrested in droves following this bill despite comparable drug use rates to white people many are still sitting in prison today biden has since acknowledged flaws in the bill but last summer he reiterated his support for the bill the law spent 30bn but contributed to only a 13 decline in violent crime he has yet to call for it to be repealed  today some cities plan to expunge marijuana records and hope to pay reparations to black people formerly incarcerated for marijuana offenses but biden can’t seem to let go he is inconsistent and ambivalent about marijuana legalization he has argued it may be a gateway drug a statement he has since dialed back of course keeping marijuana illegal at the federal level does not mean that people will not use it but rather that the extra police that he put on the street will send people of color to jail for using it ironically the police were probably nowhere to be found when biden’s friends george w bush and barack obama used marijuana if anything the drug seems to be a gateway to the white house  despite attempting to cut social programs and increasing mass incarceration biden claims to care about black families but he doesn’t seem to know many during the september 2019 democratic debate he claimed that poor families should put on a record player so their children will know more words recently during an interview with the new york times editorial board he argued that poor black parents feel ashamed because they cannot read and skip parentteacher conferences he was hoping to encourage them to be better parents but his assertion is incorrect black and white parents have comparable participation rates overall and attend parentteacher conferences at the exact same rates in fact black parents and poor parents are the most likely to check their children’s homework and meet with guidance counselors biden instead relied on stereotypes that black people are not involved in their children’s lives  harris forced biden to confront his work with racist elected officials to stop integration efforts using school busing that was not his only education mistake biden played a significant role in creating the student debt crisis including making student loan discharge “nearly impossible” this is devastating to black people who disproportionately carry school debt while the average school debt for black women with a bachelor’s degree is about 25000 that level of education does not provide the same level of financial security for black women as it does other groups including white people with less education primarily because of sexism and racism  again and again biden’s relationship with black americans like the democratic national committee’s relationship has been patronizing at best and actively harmful at worst  biden’s friendship with one black person does not mean that he’s a friend to black people  some black people will support biden because of his association with barack obama – even though obama himself doesn’t seem especially excited about biden becoming president the obama days feel distant yet warm compared to donald trump’s current presidency but remember biden cycled millions of black people in and out of jail voted for massive numbers of poor people to go to war in iraq threw anita hill under the bus to confirm a conservative justice to the us supreme court and under obama’s administration helped to deport millions of immigrants and bombed brown countries when biden was vicepresident black home ownership and wealth declined significantly even as it rose for other races biden’s friendship with one black person does not mean that he’s a friend to black people  the democratic party holds black people in an abusive relationship but says you cannot leave because the other option is more abusive that’s why i don’t believe that a vote against biden solely means a vote for trump perhaps it is a vote against being captured by the party that makes empty promises every four years when it is election time and delivers nothing perhaps it is a vote against the crime bill drones and deportations perhaps it is a vote against covert and overt racism  biden and others will rightfully argue that trump is worse and i agree but what can biden actually deliver will there be fewer drones if he’s president maybe not fewer deportations maybe not less money to police departments no will fewer black people die from police unlikely will black people have healthcare unlikely will black wealth increase unlikely will palestinian lives be safer unlikely commitments to preserving our climate doubtful if black people have a hard time figuring out the differences between trump and biden then that is biden’s problem not ours  joe biden refuses to reckon with the harm that he has caused to people all over the world his best line is that he is better than the other guy and that is exactly how abusive relationships function black people – all people – deserve better than biden

is only a matter of time before the death toll reaches 100000  during the democratic primary biden spoke of restoring normalcy after four years of donald trump frequently appealing to voters’ nostalgia for the presidency of barack obama but now as he faces the general election amid the deepening economic turmoil the presumptive democratic nominee is reaching for the legacy of a radical american president franklin delano roosevelt  “the blinders have been taken off” biden told supporters recently during a virtual fundraiser from his delaware home where he has been since march “because of this covid crisis i think people are realizing ‘my lord look at what is possible look at the institutional changes we can make’”  in recent weeks biden who has climbed above trump in national polls has openly courted progressive leaders and ideas adopting some of the populist rhetoric more commonly associated with his vanquished rivals bernie sanders and elizabeth warren in turn they have offered their fullthroated endorsements casting biden a pragmatic dealmaker who still believes in bipartisan comity as the perhaps unlikely herald of a new progressive era  “a shift of frame matters – it’s not to be underestimated” the california congressman ro khanna who was a cochair of sanders’ presidential campaign said of biden’s bold messaging “it’s a totally different vision for what he thinks the next four years should be about”  neither biden nor trump has yet laid out their vision for what the first 100 days of a new presidency might look like a benchmark established by fdr during which he offered a series of sweeping reforms  facebook twitter pinterest president franklin d roosevelt’s new deal was a tryanything moment during the great depression that remade the role of the federal government in american life photograph ap  \\ufeffbut biden and his economic advisers believe they must be prepared to marshal a far more ambitious domestic agenda than they initially imagined during daily virtual meetings biden and his team are beginning to draft a new governing vision that reflects the scale and urgency of the crisis that biden predicted may “eclipse what fdr faced”  the task is not entirely new to biden as vicepresident he led the obama administration’s response to the recession and his campaign hopes to leverage his remarkably scandalfree stewardship of the nearly 800bn stimulus package with trump’s handling of the economy  in the coming weeks biden said he would share a detailed plan “for the right kind of economic recovery” aspects of which are expected to include massive investment in public health expansive legislative action on climate change and broad new protections for workers  last week biden announced six policy taskforces – centered around issues that include healthcare climate and the economy – that pair his supporters with ideological allies of sanders among those chosen to participate are some of the young progressive leaders most skeptical of his approach including the new york congresswoman alexandria ocasiocortez  in a joint press release announcing the taskforces biden said the groups would help “transform our country”  “vicepresident biden understands in his gut that this is a totally different order of magnitude than any president has ever dealt with” said mary kay henry president of the service employees international union and a member of the healthcare taskforce  henry said the coronavirus has exposed the underlying causes of the us’s problems calling public attention to issues she believes government and business leaders can no longer afford to ignore  “we had 38 million people that have lost jobs but that’s on top of the 64 million americans who already made less than 15 an hour before covid” she said without paid sick leave some essential workers are reporting for work even if they feel ill because they can’t afford the alternative while fastfood and healthcare workers stage protests to demand protective equipment  “that level of inequality has sort of hit people between the eyes”  jared bernstein one of biden’s economic advisers said biden was looking beyond the “cyclical” challenges posed by the pandemic to the many “structural” problems it has revealed  “biden is i think developing a particularly robust agenda that really strikes at this reality that the trump economy was built on a house of sand and has turned out to be totally nonresilient to any shock” said bernstein who advised biden during his tenure as vicepresident  biden bernstein said recognizes the need for an “urgent expansion” that better insulates the american economy from the “shocks that are coming fast and furiously” not as a direct result of the pandemic but from climate change and income inequality  biden has also made other gestures he has adopted aspects of sanders’ free college tuition proposal he has embraced elizabeth warren’s bankruptcy proposal and joined with the senator viewed as a potential running mate to call for better oversight of how the trump administration spends the coronavirus relief fund  critics on the left have scoffed at the notion of biden as an fdrstyle visionary after all they say biden once told supporters that under his presidency “nothing would fundamentally change”  david sirota a former adviser to sanders 2020 presidential campaign dismissed biden’s overtures to the left as performative politics – a “canned snl skit” that progressives were being asked to accept as “something real”  \\ufeffrepublicans meanwhile view biden’s expanding policy aspirations as a political gift after the taskforce members were announced the republican national committee tagged biden a “bannerman for the socialist agenda”  biden’s policy platform – which includes a public option for healthcare and an aggressive plan to combat the climate crisis – might have been considered farreaching in another presidential cycle but during the primary he resisted pressure from activists to embrace progressive litmustest items such as medicare for all and a green new deal  campaign aides and allies say biden’s calls for change are part of a policy evolution in response to the crisis not a sudden embrace of a sandersstyle agenda biden himself has pointed to his nearly 50year political career as a guide for how he would make “institutional” changes “without us becoming a socialist country or any of that malarkey”  michael gwin a spokesman for biden’s campaign said “he’s scaling up the solutions he’s proposed so that we can meet this moment get through this crisis and ensure that we come out on the other end with a stronger middle class and a more resilient country”  surrounding his planning for the presidency is the uncertainty over who will control the house and senate which is suddenly within reach for democrats yet there are signs that the coronavirus and trump’s handling of the crisis have scrambled the political calculus giving biden new latitude to move in a far bolder direction  a recent survey by the nonpartisan pew research center found that the public’s view of the economy has darkened dramatically just 23 of americans describe the economic outlook as “excellent” or “good” down from 57 at the start of the year the same poll found overwhelming support for the 2tn coronavirus relief measure passed by congress last month a marked contrast from the polarized partisan views of the stimulus package passed to stem the economic fallout from the great recession  “i can’t underscore enough the extent to which this economic moment is unprecedented” said steph sterling vicepresident of advocacy and policy at the liberal roosevelt institute “our institutions need to shift to meet

            "['292', 'will covid19 mutate into a more dangerous virus', 'as the coronavirus spreads around the world there are concerns that it will mutate into a form that is more transmissible more dangerous or both potentially making the global health crisis even worse what do we know about the way the virus is evolving  is the virus mutating  all viruses mutate and the sarscov2 coronavirus that causes covid19 is no exception mutations arise when the virus replicates inside cells and mistakes are made in copying its genetic code unlike humans whose genes are written in doublestranded dna the coronavirus genes are carried on singlestranded rna  how fast is the virus mutating  the coronavirus is actually quite stable scientists have analysed about 13000 samples in britain since midmarch and found that new mutations appear roughly twice a month the rate of mutations is important because the faster a virus mutates the quicker it changes behaviour a fastevolving virus can be harder to make a vaccine against because by the time it has been developed the parts of the virus the immune system attacks might have changed seasonal influenza mutates so rapidly we need a different vaccine each year  how does coronavirus vary around the world  the genetic code from coronaviruses around the globe show that it splits into groups as it spreads there is nothing unusual about this researchers in germany identified three main genetic groups of the virus in april which they named a b and c groups a and c are mostly found in europeans and americans while group b is most common in east asia but there are smaller groups too which scientists can use to trace infections back to their sources and ultimately back to a region such as wuhan or northern italy  why do mutations matter  mutations happen by chance all the time most have little effect and some hamper the virus but over time single or multiple mutations can potentially build up that make the virus more successful by enabling it to spread more easily mutations can also make the virus more dangerous for example by making it more efficient at infecting cells  what mutations has the virus picked up  a number of mutations have caught scientists’ attention researchers at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine studied more than 5000 coronavirus genomes from around the world and discovered several mutations that may be evidence of the virus adapting to humans two mutations are in the critical “spike” protein that the virus uses to invade cells  the spike mutations are rare at the moment but martin hibberd a professor of emerging infectious diseases and a senior author on the study which has yet to be peerreviewed said their emergence highlighted the need for global surveillance of the virus that will reveal whether the new mutations help it to spread and whether vaccines may need to be redesigned  in another preliminary study scientists at sheffield university and los alamos national laboratory in new mexico found similar mutations in the spike protein which the authors claim may help the infection to spread while that is possible other scientists believe it is too early to know whether any of the mutations are helping the virus thrive  prof nick loman at the university of birmingham said that all coronaviruses are very similar and that viruses with particular mutations can rise up in different areas for a range of reasons a major factor is which virus gains a foothold first the socalled founder effect which may come down to one person’s travel plans rather than any adaptation of the virus “from the point of view of people who are understandably concerned about this pandemic i’m sure it will not matter which mutations the virus has it’s not a good virus either way” he said “we look to see if any of the mutations change behaviour and we don’t have any evidence for that”  but there is some reason for hope another preliminary study this time by researchers in the uk and us revealed that after looking at more than 15000 coronavirus genomes from patients around the world scientists found no sign the virus is becoming more transmissible – in other words it is not becoming easier to pass from person to person  the team found 6822 mutations in total relative to the ancestral genome however none of the genomes showed more than 29 single position changes known as snps the researchers then focused on 31 mutations that appear to have arisen independently at least 10 times  “if there is a mutation that appears and makes it transmit better then we should see it happening multiple times” said prof francois balloux a coauthor of the research at university college london however the team found these mutations either had a neutral impact on the virus or were actually detrimental to it  what else can mutations tell us  as scientists learn more about the genetic makeup of coronaviruses they will be able to use the information to trace an individual’s infection to nearby clusters and ultimately back to its origin that can be useful for tracing outbreaks and spotting newly imported infections but intense monitoring will also flag up how the virus mutates and acquires resistance to and drugs and vaccines that are used in the future “as those become available we would expect to see functional mutations just like with see with antibiotic resistance in bacteria” loman said']\n",

            "['295', 'why we might not get a coronavirus vaccine', 'politicians have become more cautious about immunisation prospects they are right to be  it would be hard to overstate the importance of developing a vaccine to sarscov2 – it’s seen as the fast track to a return to normal life that’s why the health secretary matt hancock said the uk was “throwing everything at it”  but while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed – oxford university is now recruiting 10000 volunteers for the next phase of its research – ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days  this is why  why might a vaccine fail  earlier this week england’s deputy chief medical officer jonathan vantam said the words nobody wanted to hear “we can’t be sure we will get a vaccine”  but he was right to be circumspect  vaccines are simple in principle but complex in practice the ideal vaccine protects against infection prevents its spread and does so safely but none of this is easily achieved as vaccine timelines show  more than 30 years after scientists isolated hiv the virus that causes aids we have no vaccine the dengue fever virus was identified in 1943 but the first vaccine was approved only last year and even then amid concerns it made the infection worse in some people the fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps it took four years  scientists have worked on coronavirus vaccines before so are not starting from scratch two coronaviruses have caused lethal outbreaks before namely sars and mers and vaccine research went ahead for both but none have been licensed partly because sars fizzled out and mers is regional to the middle east the lessons learned will help scientists create a vaccine for sarscov2 but there is still an awful lot to learn about the virus  a chief concern is that coronaviruses do not tend to trigger longlasting immunity about a quarter of common colds are caused by human coronaviruses but the immune response fades so rapidly that people can become reinfected the next year  researchers at oxford university recently analysed blood from recovered covid19 patients and found that levels of igg antibodies – those responsible for longerlasting immunity – rose steeply in the first month of infection but then began to fall again  last week scientists at rockefeller university in new york found that most people who recovered from covid19 without going into hospital did not make many killer antibodies against the virus  “that’s what is particularly challenging” says stanley perlman a veteran coronavirus researcher at the university of iowa “if the natural infection doesn’t give you that much immunity except when it’s a severe infection what will a vaccine do it could be better but we don’t know” if a vaccine only protects for a year the virus will be with us for some time  the genetic stability of the virus matters too some viruses such as influenza mutate so rapidly that vaccine developers have to release new formulations each year the rapid evolution of hiv is a major reason we have no vaccine for the disease  so far the sarscov2 coronavirus seems fairly stable but it is acquiring mutations as all viruses do some genetic changes have been spotted in the virus’s protein “spikes” which are the basis of most vaccines if the spike protein mutates too much the antibodies produced by a vaccine will effectively be out of date and might not bind the virus effectively enough to prevent infection  martin hibberd professor of emerging infectious diseases at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine who helped identify some of the virus’s mutations called them “an early warning”  another challenge making any vaccine safe  in the rush to develop a vaccine – there are now more than 100 in development – safety must remain a priority unlike experimental drugs for the severely ill the vaccine will be given to potentially billions of generally healthy people  this means scientists will have to check extremely carefully for signs of dangerous sideeffects during the search for a sars vaccine in 2004 scientists found that one candidate caused hepatitis in ferrets another serious concern is “antibodyinduced enhancement” where the antibodies produced by a vaccine actually make future infections worse the effect caused serious lung damage in animals given experimental vaccines for both sars and mers  john mccauley director of the worldwide influenza centre at the francis crick institute says it takes time to understand the particular challenges each vaccine throws up “you don’t know the difficulties the specific difficulties that every vaccine will give you” he says “and we haven’t got experience in handling this virus or the components of the virus”  we should ‘end up with something’ … but what does that mean  when the prime minister boris johnson told a no 10 press briefing that a vaccine was “by no means guaranteed” his chief scientific adviser patrick vallance agreed but added “i’d be surprised if we didn’t end up with something” many scientists share that view  in all likelihood a coronavirus vaccine will not be 100 effective  those in development draw on at least eight different approaches from weakened and inactivated viruses to technologies that smuggle genetic code into the recipient’s cells which then churn out spike proteins for the immune system to make antibodies against  ideally a vaccine will generate persistent high levels of antibodies to wipe out the virus and also “t” cells to destroy infected cells but each vaccine is different and today no one knows what kind of immune response is good enough  “we don’t even know if a vaccine can produce an immune response which would protect against future infection” says david heymann who led the response of the world health organization who to the sars epidemic  early results from two frontrunner vaccines suggest they might have some use  the us biotech firm moderna reported antibody levels similar to those found in recovered patients in 25 people who received its vaccine  another vaccine from oxford university did not stop monkeys contracting the virus but did appear to prevent pneumonia a major cause of death in coronavirus patients  if humans react the same way vaccinated people would still spread the virus but be less likely to die from it  how well a vaccine works determines how it is used armed with a highly effective vaccine that protects for several years countries could aim for herd immunity by protecting at least twothirds of the population  coronavirus patients pass the virus on to three others on average but if two or more are immune the outbreak will fizzle out that is the bestcase scenario  more likely is we will end up with a vaccine or a number of vaccines that are only partially effective  vaccines that contain weakened strains of virus can be dangerous for older people but might be given to younger people with more robust immune systems to reduce the spread of infection  meanwhile older people might get vaccines that simple prevent infections progressing to lifethreatening pneumonia “if you don’t have the ability to induce immunity you’ve got to develop a strategy for reducing serious outcomes of infection” says mccauley  but partially effective vaccines have their own problems a vaccine that doesn’t stop the virus replicating can encourage resistant strains to evolve making the vaccine redundant  so is the virus here to stay  the simple answer is yes  hopes for eliminating the virus start with a vaccine but do not end there “if and when we have a vaccine what you get is not rainbows and unicorns” says larry brilliant ceo of pandefense advisory who led the who’s smallpox eradication programme “if we are forced to choose a vaccine that gives only one year of protection then we are doomed to have covid become endemic an infection that is always with us”  the virus will still be tough to conquer with a vaccine that lasts for years  “it will be harder to get rid of covid than smallpox” says brilliant with smallpox it was at least clear who was infected whereas people with coronavirus can spread it without knowing a thornier problem is that as long as the infection rages in one country all other nations are at risk  as david salisbury the former director of immunisation at the department of health told a chatham house webinar recently “unless we have a vaccine available in unbelievable quantities that could be administered extraordinarily quickly in all communities in the world we will have gaps in our defences that the virus can continue to circulate in”  or as brilliant puts it the virus will “pingpong back and forth in time and geography”  one proposal from gavi the vaccine alliance is to boost the availability of vaccines around the world through an “advance market commitment” and brilliant believes some kind of global agreement must be hammered out now “we should be demanding now a global conference on what we’re going to do when we get a vaccine or if we don’t” he says  “if the process of getting a vaccine testing it proving it manufacturing it planning for its delivery and building a vaccine programme all over the world if that’s going to take as long as we think then let’s fucking start planning it now”  how will we live with the virus  people will have to adapt – and life will change heymann says we will have to get used to extensive monitoring for infections backed up by swift outbreak containment people must play their part too by maintaining handwashing physical distancing and avoiding gatherings particularly in enclosed spaces repurposed drugs are faster to test than vaccines so we may have an antiviral or an antibody treatment that works before a vaccine is available he adds immediate treatment when symptoms come on could at least reduce the death rate  yuen kwokyung a professor of infectious disease at the university of hong kong has advised his government that all social distancing can be relaxed – but only if people wear masks in enclosed spaces such as on trains and at work and that no food or drink are consumed at concerts and cinemas  at restaurants tables will have to be shielded from each other and serving staff will follow strict rules to prevent spreading the virus “in our hong kong perspective the diligent and correct use of reusable masks is the most important measure” he says  sarita jane robinson a psychologist who studies responses to threats at the university of central lancashire says people are still adapting to the “new normal” and that without more interventions – such as fines for not wearing face masks – “we could see people drifting back to old behaviours”  we might become blase about covid19 deaths when life resumes and the media move on but the seriousness of the illness will make it harder to ignore she says  has the coronavirus pandemic made us all nicer read more  one last possibility could save a lot of trouble some scientists wonder whether the common cold coronaviruses crossed into humans in the distant past and caused similar illness before settling down “if the virus doesn’t change there’s no reason to think that miraculously in five years’ time it won’t still cause pneumonia” says perlman “but that’s the hope that we end up with a much more mild disease and you only get a bad cold from it”  heymann says it is too soon to know how the pandemic will pan out “we don’t understand the destiny of this virus” he says “will it continue to circulate after its first pandemic or will it like some other pandemic viruses disappear or become less virulent that we do not know”']\n",

what you need to know read more  there was a rush to use the drug in covid19 cases after the french doctor didier raoult said he was curing his patients at la timone hospital in marseille the us president then claimed hydroxychloroquine – less toxic than the original chloroquine – was a cure and later said he was taking it himself against coronavirus  the drugs are fairly safe for patients being treated for malaria but covid19 is a very different disease the authors of the paper pulled together results for more than 96000 patients in 671 hospitals taking one of the drugs with or without an antibiotic such as azithromycin between 20 december and 14 april  the death rate among all groups taking the drugs was higher than among people who were not given them one in six of those taking one of the drugs died while one in five died if they were taking chloroquine with an antibiotic and one in four if they were on hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic the death rate among patients not taking the drugs was one in 11  play video 112 an individual decision trump defends taking unproved coronavirus drug hydroxychloroquine – video  the statistics are not exactly comparable because as this was not a trial there were differences in the age gender general health and stage of illness of the patients but the us authors of the study say allowing for these differences there was still higher mortality among those taking the drugs  the team also found that serious cardiac arrhythmias which cause the lower chamber of the heart to beat rapidly and irregularly were more common in all the groups receiving one of the four treatment regimens the biggest increase was in the group treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic where 8 of patients developed a heart arrhythmia compared with 03 of patients not given the drugs  “this is the first largescale study to find statistically robust evidence that treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine does not benefit patients with covid19” said prof mandeep r mehra lead author of the study and executive director of the brigham and women’s hospital advanced heart disease center in boston us  “instead our findings suggest it may be associated with an increased risk of serious heart problems and increased risk of death randomised clinical trials are essential to confirm any harms or benefits associated with these agents in the meantime we suggest these drugs should not be used as treatments for covid19 outside of clinical trials”  others scientists suggested the drugs should no longer be used in covid19 treatments except for carefully controlled clinical trials  hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus a guide to the scientific studies so far read more  dr stephen griffin associate professor in the school of medicine university of leeds said the paper was “potentially a landmark study for covid19 therapy while not a placebocontrolled trial an observational study on this scale undertaken with stringent and meticulous analysis is powerful indeed” he said  “whilst controlled trials will be required for confident affirmation the indications are that these drugs certainly ought not to be used outside of a trial setting where patients can be monitored for complications one might also question whether the resources necessary for large studies might be better diverted to other causes at the same time allowing the drugs themselves to be used for their original purpose  “furthermore it is clear that highprofile endorsements of taking these drugs without clinical oversight are both misguided and irresponsible”  stephen evans professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine said it was unlikely that trials would now find any substantial benefit from the drugs “a definitive answer still awaits the results of the randomised trials but it is clear that the drugs should not be given for treatment of covid19 other than in the context of a randomised trial  “it might even be said that to go on giving them other than in a trial is unethical given this evidence that is not yet contradicted by other available evidence”']\n",

night he was celebrating the end of his junior year exams by eating chicken wings playing fortnite and facetiming his friends  but last month jackson unwittingly went viral after he released a tiktok video raising the alarm on the huge number of covid19 cases hitting the navajo nation a territory occupying parts of arizona utah and new mexico  he compares the situation in the navajo nation – now first in the us in terms of cases per 100000 with 4253 cases and 146 known deaths to west virginia west virginia spans 24038 square miles – making it smaller than the navajo nation at 27413 square miles despite this jackson explains “west virginia is living on 163 grocery stores we’re living on 13 they are living on 63 hospitals we are living on six”  “today we live on broken treaties and broken promises from the us government … this is america” he finishes  leeanndroid leeanndroid we are seeing realtime the disproportionate impact of covid19    thx for making this educational vid jojojackson18 pictwittercomf4ejlash3s  at the time the navajo nation had the thirdhighest number of covid19 cases in the us and yet jackson could find scant news on the issue on monday this week the navajo nation surpassed new york state for the highest covid19 infection rate  “i was like – everyone knows everything about new york there are so many different news outlets reporting on this one state why is there no news coverage for us or any native americans” he says “i just thought that wasn’t fair  “i just wanted to spread awareness to give people basic raw information because i thought the news was sugarcoating it i wanted to show what it’s like here the number of covid19 cases and the basic resources the navajo nation just doesn’t have” he says  on monday the navajo nation population 357000 surpassed new york and new jersey’s covid19 cases per 100000 despite being almost 25 times smaller than new york 195m and new jersey 89m the figures indicate that coronavirus has penetrated 23 of the navajo nation’s population compared with 18 in new york state  “that makes me pretty sad” says jackson “it’s really disappointing it gets under your skin it makes you angry it’s really sad to think that people would push a whole group of people under the rug and just pretend that they are not there” he says  the navajo nation is under strict lockdown terms right now including a 57hour lockdown rule over the weekends that sees no one coming in or out of the reservation people can’t leave their homes between 8pm to 5am unless they are an essential worker or have a written pass    so why are the cases so high “thirty per cent of people in the navajo nation still don’t have clean running water or electricity we are being told to regularly wash our hands but for a lot of people that’s a 40 miles plus trip” jackson says “plus our resources are really low on the navajo nation – there are only six hospitals” he adds  the guardian’s own reporting revealed the navajo nation received its relief package six weeks after it was promised – only receiving it after suing the federal government meanwhile indian country reports that the 8bn relief package set aside for almost 600 native american tribes is “woefully inadequate”  jackson has an entire youtube channel in the name of jojo jackson dedicated to native american culture lipsyncing over navajo artist radmilla cody’s songs sharing his favorite sayings and showcasing the fairs on the navajo nation that he loves he enjoys making those videos most – but that doesn’t seem to be what the rest of the world is interested in  “my videos only ever become viral when it is a cry for help people never notice us for our culture or anything positive and then they say ‘oh all they ever do is complain” explains jackson    he is also often contacted by people spewing ignorance at him they talk about native americans being freeloaders because of ancient treaties promising native americans healthcare and schooling “yeah we have free healthcare but we only have six hospitals here and look at what is happening” he says  does he think that trump is doing enough to help “i don’t think there will ever be a time where the government has done enough for native americans considering what they have done to us in the past and where we are now” says jackson  he points out that even aside from the covid19 crisis going on reservations right now native american women are killed and trafficked at much higher rates than the us average – with a murder rate 10 times higher than the average on some reservations meanwhile native people are currently having their sacred burial grounds blown up to build a border wall  i ask him what message he wants to leave people with “i just want us to be seen not as ‘other’ but just as people” he says']\n",

a death rate more than twice that of the overall population  the disease is ripping through why coronavirus is devastating californias pacific islanders  the coronavirus is tearing through native hawaiian and other pacific islander communities in california fanning longstanding health disparities and killing community members at a higher rate than any other racial group in the state  data from california’s department of public health reveals that pacific islanders have contracted coronavirus at nearly twice the state’s overall rate as of 17 may they have died from the virus at a rate 26 times higher than the state population – the highest death rate of any racial or ethnic group  the pattern extends beyond california oregon utah washington and arkansas – where many marshallese work in meatpacking plants – have all seen similar trends  public health experts have often said the group’s relatively small size can skew the numbers making percentages appear outsized but to community members and advocates that argument obfuscates a long history of overlooked needs and health disparities  time and again we’ve been told ‘your numbers are so small they’re statistically insignificant natalie ah soon regional pacific islander task force  “time and again we’ve been told ‘your numbers are so small they’re statistically insignificant’” said natalie ah soon cochair of the regional pacific islander task force “we’ve heard that before we didn’t know infant mortality rates were a concern in our community until they published the data  “when i hear someone say we’re ‘statistically insignificant’ i hear ‘i’m not going to devote my time and mental energy to comb through this data’ this disease is just ripping through our communities and we continue to be overlooked”  about 317000 pacific islanders with origins in hawaii guam tonga samoa fiji or the marshall islands live in california making up less than 1 of the state’s population the communities account for 537 of the state’s 80400 confirmed coronavirus cases and 28 of the 3300 deaths attributed to the virus  the impact of covid19 among pacific islanders is exacerbated by the high prevalence of a range of preexisting health conditions in the community including diabetes hypertension and high cholesterol  roughly one in five pacific islanders have been diagnosed with heart disease and they are 46 more likely than the general population to be diagnosed with cancer – a rate higher than any other racial group according to an april report from the pacific islander center of primary care excellence  high poverty rates lack of access to healthcare and higher than average rates of “essential workers” can compound risk and accelerate the spread of the virus among pacific islander communities said the organization  life in multigenerational households common among communities of pacific islanders complicates the challenge to maintain distance – especially if a member of the household works in the community and returns home to elders  ‘alisi tulua who is tongan and a member of the national pacific islander covid19 response team believes coronavirus is also spreading in the community because “nobody is talking about it”  “there’s always a lot of stigma around disease in our community tongans are faithful people and there’s been negativity attached to the narrative around coronavirus – a sense that if you have it god must be punishing you for something” she said  ah soon said the stigma and shame were consistent with commonly held beliefs in samoan and other pacific islander communities and often created barriers to preventive healthcare and testing  “when we’re sick there’s a belief that it’s probably because of something that we did to offend our ancestors it’s something that’s hard to explain through a western lens but it’s very common” ah soon said  while it’s clear the pacific islander community is heavily affected incomplete data statewide prevents a comprehensive view  in some regions where data is available the local discrepancies of covid’s impact are stark in los angeles county for example officials say the infection rate for pacific islanders is four times that of the population the death rate is more than six times greater  but in the san francisco bay area home to 87000 pacific islanders only five of nine counties – alameda san mateo marin santa clara and san francisco – disaggregate data for pacific islanders according to melissa jones executive director of the bay area regional health inequities initiative  some california counties don’t report racial or ethnic data at all  a spokeswoman for the public health department in sacramento county which reports deaths among pacific islanders as “other” told calmatters in early may “we are not currently tailoring any outreach to this community because of the very small percentage it makes up of the population and impact”  if you don’t know where the disparity is you can’t address it kimi watkinstartt alameda county public health chief  the alameda county public health director kimi watkinstartt said her county’s decision to disaggregate data was part of a longstanding push toward health equity  “if you don’t know where the disparity is you can’t address it” watkinstartt said  one reason for the incomplete data in california and elsewhere is that while labs and hospitals are required by law to report positive cases healthcare entities may not be required to collect and report racial and ethnic data explained ninez ponce director of the center for health policy research at ucla  data collection is prone to errors patients sometimes don’t selfidentify on hospital intake forms and healthcare staff can report inaccurate information or leave sections blank rendering racial and ethnic data imperfect she said  that doesn’t mean counties can’t choose to prioritize data collection and reporting said tulua  “we had a conversation with the chief science officer in la county on a wednesday and explained the need for more data by friday it was published it’s absolutely possible for counties to do this” she said  four hundred miles north in alameda county the rate of coronavirus cases among pacific islanders is the thirdhighest among racial groups – behind latinos and african americans watkinstartt said she was concerned about the picture data revealed for pacific islanders but she was not shocked  “seeing the data for rates of coronavirus infection was not completely surprising to us because we’ve already seen it in chronic disease we’ve seen it in infant mortality rates”  cultural traditions hang in the balance  meanwhile some pacific islanders are worried that coronavirus is not only threatening the health of their members but also their customs  the night before the funeral for her 15yearold nephew ah soon couldn’t sleep  funerals are sacred events their importance deeply ingrained in samoan culture family members will drive hours to attend often hauling trailers filled with cultural items for the si’i a traditional way of showing support for loved ones  facebook twitter pinterest ah soon’s family prepares for a si’i in

coronavirus ah soon said the funeral director warned the family that no more than 10 people would be allowed to attend the funeral and graveside service – and if they violated the rule police would come to disperse the crowd  the death of ah soon’s nephew william valelei i’aulualo wasn’t attributed to coronavirus he had type 1 diabetes and suffered health complications she said but with

“we were all in sadness and disbelief my son and my nephew were the same age and very close but i kept tossing and turning finally i texted my sister that we just couldn’t come it was very painful”  to pull pacific islanders through the pandemic advocates and healthcare professionals have organized a national response team and regional taskforces sharing best practices and tips for consistent messaging central to the efforts across groups is a demand for better data  taunu’u ve’e cochair of the regional pacific islander taskforce said it was crucial that trusted members of the community remain involved in the fight against coronavirus by leveraging relationships and ensuring that communication and contact tracing is done in a culturally and linguistically appropriate way  at stake said ah soon were their elders and their very culture  “we’re worried about our elders and what will be lost so much of our tradition is oral and relies on engaging with elders” she said “those are

apparent lockdown breach which was revealed in an investigation by the guardian and the mirror  durham constabulary spoke to cummings’s family to remind them of the lockdown rules after receiving reports on 31 march that he was in durham days after becoming sick  the acting durham police crime and victims’ commissioner steve white said cummings’s trip to durham was “unwise” he added “to beat this crisis we need to be selfless as millions have been the response by the people of county durham and darlington have been exemplary which makes this most frustrating and concerning”  downing street and cummings have repeatedly refused to answer questions from the guardian over a number of weeks about cummings’s movements  they broke their silence on saturday cummings said “i behaved reasonably and legally who cares about good looks it’s a question of doing the right thing”  downing street said “owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell it was essential for dominic cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for his sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed  “at no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter his actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines mr cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally”  durham police said on friday that officers had “explained to the family the lockdown guidelines” on saturday the force said it was standing by its statement and had nothing further to add  the bbc reported that an anonymous source close to cummings had claimed that a “small number of people in no 10 knew that cummings had gone to durham”  laura kuenssberg bbclaurak few more details this morning   small number of people in no 10 knew that cummings had gone to durham not stayed in london seems it was his sister who had offered to help with childcare when he and his wife fell ill  family stayed in separate house  had no contact in the end  this prompted the scottish national party’s westminster leader ian blackford to accuse downing street of trying to suppress the story  blackford said “what i find interesting … is that members of downing street knew about this so first and foremost boris johnson has serious questions to answer over what now appears to be a coverup”  responding to no 10’s statement a spokesperson for the labour party said “the lockdown rules were very clear if you or anyone in your household was suspected of having covid19 you must immediately selfisolate and not leave the house however the prime minister’s chief adviser appears to believe that it is one rule for him and another for the british people  “this will cause understandable anger for the millions of people who have sacrificed so much during this crisis  “no 10’s statement also raises more questions than it answers we are still unclear who knew about this decision and when whether this was sanctioned by the prime minister and whether no 10 is now questioning the validity of the statement from durham police  “at this afternoon’s press conference we will be expecting answers to these questions”  the guardian first approached downing street for a comment in april after being told by a neighbour of cummings’s parents that they had seen him at the durham property on 5 april  no 10 refused to discuss the issue at the time a spokesman said “it’ll be a no comment on that one we wouldn’t get into location of individual members of staff”  speaking to bbc radio 4’s today programme blackford said “the prime minister must explain exactly when he knew about the breaking of the rules whether he sanctioned it why cummings wasn’t sacked immediately and why it appears that he tried to cover it up not telling the public until the newspapers broke the story eight weeks later last night”  dave penman the general secretary of the fda the union that represents senior civil servants said johnson had a duty to explain cummings’s behaviour  he told today “i think the prime minister needs to understand how heartbreaking this lockdown has been for so many families and the sacrifices that have been made up and down the country  “i think in these circumstances if it looks like there is one rule for those at the centre of government and one rule for the rest of the country then really the prime minister has a responsibility as well as a constitutional responsibility to explain his actions he has known about this for six weeks”  plaid cymru and the liberal democrats have also called for cummings to resign or be sacked one tory mp told the guardian “i won’t be lifting a finger to defend him”  they suggested cummings would find few defenders in the parliamentary conservative party “he isn’t popular with most tory mps the radio silence on the tory mp whatsapp group since the story broke is pretty telling the issue is he’s increasingly becoming the story the cardinal sin of any spad special adviser”  the foreign secretary dominic raab accused opponents of cummings of trying “politicise” his behaviour he tweeted “it’s reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this and it has been provided two parents with coronavirus were anxiously taking care of their young child those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror”  his cabinet colleague michael gove tweeted “caring for your wife and child is not a crime”  prof susan michie of university college london

country only to be treated as secondclass citizens  when dedan kimathi ji jaga returned from combat in vietnam he painted his walls black covered his windows and sat in darkness all day his injuries and posttraumatic stress were severe but as with many african american soldiers in 1968 the us government gave him little support  “they summarily released me back to the streets with no aid” said the 72yearold california resident  black veterans across america are hoping this painful and enduring legacy will get the attention it deserves in spike lee’s new film da 5 bloods which chronicles the journey of four african american vets who return to vietnam in search of their fallen squad leader and buried gold  “the plight of african american service members who served in vietnam where they are now why they are the way they are this should be brought to light” said richard d kingsberry a veteran in charlotte north carolina who began his service in 1972 in the navy “a lot of african american service members never got cared for properly after they returned and that is a lifealtering impact”  facebook twitter pinterest a poster for spike lee’s new film photograph netflix  starring chadwick boseman lee’s film follows his oscarwinning blackkklansman which was loosely based on the true story of a black policeman who infiltrated the ku klux klan da 5 bloods coming to netflix on 12 june promises another politically charged war epic where “our heroes battle forces of man and nature – while confronted by the lasting ravages of the immorality” of vietnam  the complexities of black veterans’ history is rarely reflected on screen and some retired service members said they were anxious for lee’s exploration which portrays the powerful moment a group of african american soldiers listening to the radio in the vietnamese jungle learned of the assassination of dr martin luther king jr  their lives were shaped by fighting america’s first fully integrated war while riots and racial tensions exploded back home  “we as blacks ever since the civil war have always run to america’s defense and then when we get back we’re secondclass citizens” said larry doggette a 70yearold vietnam veteran who lives in hampton virginia “we still are today”  in 1967 black americans were roughly 11 of the civilian population but 163 of soldiers drafted and 23 of vietnam combat troops some refused the draft like muhammad ali a conscientious objector who said “my conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother or some darker people or some poor hungry people in the mud for big powerful america” and “i ain’t got no quarrel with them vietcong”  but doggette raised on a dairy farm joined the marines in 1969 when he said the options for a black american graduating high school were to “work for somebody for little or no money or go to the military” while deployed in vietnam he found himself caught in the same kind of riots that martin luther king jr’s assassination had just sparked in us cities “white and black not only had to look out for the enemy they gotta look out for each other”  he said he didn’t fully understand the racism he was perpetuating against vietnamese people until he came home and “white america started treating me worse than what i was taught to think about the vietnamese”  facebook twitter pinterest a wounded us soldier is carried to a helicopter in vietnam in 1969 photograph netflixrexshutterstock  thomas davis 78 had hearing problems after his service during vietnam but he struggled to get the department of veterans affairs va to approve basic disability claims meanwhile he watched white veterans receive meaningful financial support for less severe injuries he recalled “as african americans we lost more than anyone else … but this whole damn time we have not been treated fairly”  davis eventually started yakima washington’s first blackowned construction business but when white local residents responded to his newspaper ads for a veteranowned contractor they would often decline to work with him after meeting in person  the main work he was able to get after the war was through affirmative action programs with government jobs he said  when ji jaga went to the va officials concluded he showed signs of mental instability but that it could not be classified and did not merit benefits  ji jaga who now lives in richmond california said he eventually found an outlet and some community in the black panther party which launched in oakland “that allowed me to come back down to earth”  facebook twitter pinterest larry doggette in chu lai vietnam 1970 photograph courtesy larry doggette  later he participated in a ptsd study with other veterans and two of his white friends in the group ended up receiving va compensation he still was not approved for benefits “i don’t think this country has the consciousness to do what’s right for its citizens of color much less its veterans of color we were asking for entitlements that we had earned”  kingsberry commander of the national association for black veterans noted that many african american soldiers were forced to do menial and degrading jobs upon their return from vietnam like cleaning and maintenance and that some fed up with the disrespect wound up dishonorably discharged denying them any benefits for the rest of their lives “it was devastating and heartbreaking but it was a reflection of the country”  it was difficult to quantify the longterm impacts of this disparate treatment on the health economic opportunities and quality of life of black veterans he added “when white america hurts something has to be done but when black america hurts it’s ‘y’all need to get over it’” he said he hoped any broader reckoning of this decadeslong inequality would address the need for “true reparations” but he’s not holding his breath “no one wants to broach that subject and congress doesn’t want to write that check”  a good place to start would be recognition of the sacrifices black soldiers made in vietnam and after kingsberry said adding that he hoped lee’s film sparked that conversation “we need more stories of african americans that served in that era”  facebook twitter pinterest spike lee’s film shines a light on a story that needs telling veterans say photograph jeanbaptiste lacroixafp via getty images  for his part lee is more than committed to recording the untold history of black valor “we’ve always believed in this country” he said in a recent interview “that is why we fought for this country even knowing we were slaves in the civil war … we built this motherfucker i mean we’ve been nothing but patriotic and this great great country has not really made its promise yet to people of color”  lee is releasing his film at a time when the covid19 crisis carries painful parallels for some african american veterans given the unequal losses of black americans in the epidemic coronavirus fatalities in the us have surpassed the country’s vietnam death toll  “these are the most vulnerable people why aren’t you doing something more to help the less fortunate” said larry donnell dugger a 69yearold veteran adding that the continued killings of african americans by law enforcement similarly keep “the door open to a lot of anger and lack of trust” for black veterans “there is supposed to be a system for everyone the wounds that are visible and invisible will always be there”']\n",

in our exclusive interview he was ‘thrown under the bus’  andré leon talley – legendary fashion editor prince of excess – has taken a fair few luxury holidays in his time firstclass flights to biarritz private jets shopping trips to florence by concorde but sometimes he keeps it simple and spends a quiet weekend with his friend the shoe designer manolo blahnik in bath “at his residence on the crescent”  “manolo will be in the kitchen cooking his wonderful cuisine and i’ll be in the larder lacquering my louis vuitton cases with yacht varnish bringing them to a high shine” he tells me  wait did he say “yacht varnish”  “yes yacht yacht it’s nothing esoteric i was inspired by mrs vreeland who told me her suitcases were lacquered in yacht varnish” he says referring to the late diana vreeland a former editor of us vogue and talley’s first mentor  facebook twitter pinterest with his mentor diana vreeland in 1974 photograph bill cunningham foundation  talley has more than 50 pieces of vuitton hand luggage currently residing unused in his second home in north carolina “because there’s no one at the airports to carry them now” so he gets through a lot of lacquer in pursuit of “this refined dandy lifestyle it’s not about glamour – it’s selfrespect a standard” nor is it about snobbery “i may have had moments of hauteur hauteur but i was never a snob you can ask princess gloria von thurn und taxis or lady amanda harlech”  the fashion shows are never short of overthetop characters but talley was always the first to grab everyone’s attention whatever room he was in how could he not he was a 6ft 7in african american in a sweeping kaftan surrounded by thin white women in cocktail dresses next to him would be the thinnest of all anna wintour his boss at american vogue  talley was her creative director and later editoratlarge and it was said he was the only person who could tell wintour if she looked bad in a dress “i would never be so rude as to say ‘you look bad’” talley corrects me “i would say ‘oh who made that’ and my eyebrows would raise to the ceiling and there would be a silence” while other fashion journalists tend to speak in a tone of elegant boredom talley’s voice rang out at every show and party swinging between a boom and a shriek  many people who work in fashion come from a relatively privileged background when i was 21 i was offered a job at us vogue and when i balked at the low salary i was told “most people who work at vogue have a private income” talley did not raised by his grandmother a maid in durham north carolina under jim crow laws he could barely afford food when he started as a journalist for decades he was the only black person on the front row joined later by the great fashion illustrator and vanity fair’s style director michael roberts and the washington post’s robin givhan the only fashion writer ever to win a pulitzer this gives you an idea of just how talented a person of colour has to be to break into this still extremely white world  facebook twitter pinterest with wintour in 2007 photograph brad barketgetty images  during his four decades at the magazine publishing house condé nast talley wrote landmark features including michelle obama’s vogue interview after becoming first lady and oversaw some of its most extraordinary shoots including naomi campbell as scarlett o’hara for vanity fair inverting gone with the wind’s racial dynamics his profiles could be overly chummy – he often interviewed friends – but they were soaked in his outsized personality and his shoots were joyful for a long time he was the most powerful black man in fashion now overtaken only by edward enninful editor of british vogue when enninful got that job he wrote to talley to tell him “you paved the way”  or as talley puts it “i scorched the earth with my talent and i let my light shine” now he has written a memoir that blows it all up like a glorious firecracker shooting into the sky    “this is the guardian yes” he says pronouncing it the french way “gwardian” talley is talking on the phone “from my librarykitchenlaundry room” in his home in a new york suburb he has a courtly way of speaking mixing southern good manners with faintly european pronunciations friends are always referred to as if he were introducing them to an ambassador at a party “annette de la renta and oscar de la renta very close and dear friends of mine” and “the late lee radziwill the sister of jackie kennedy who was one of my greatest friends in my life and it was not a known fact we were that close”  “the first thing i want to say about my book is this” he begins “this work my epistle is about not only my contribution to the world but how did my presence change that world and how was my work regarded and disregarded by anna wintour i am 71 years old and i take my story with me wherever i go the past is always in the present”  facebook twitter pinterest with paloma picasso and her then husband playwright rafael lopezsanchez in 1979 photograph penske mediarexshutterstock  i read his new memoir the chiffon trenches in one hot weekend barely able to put it down the writing is deliciously good and as a narrator talley is both incisive and dizzyingly unreliable which adds to the fun a previous memoir alt published in 2003 often felt hamstrung by professional loyalties “i had to bite my tongue about certain people for fear of reprisals” he writes there is no tonguebiting here “this is not a bitchy tellall” he says although some may disagree karl lagerfeld who died last year was talley’s close friend for 40 years and showered him with gifts including 50000 for his 50th birthday because that’s how dandies roll but in the book he is depicted as brilliant yet monstrous capriciously dropping close friends for no reason including you won’t be surprised to learn talley  “i would never have talked about this while karl was alive out of respect for him and fear of his reprisals” he says  what would lagerfeld have done “he could have decimated my reputation in fashion” so instead talley has decimated his  meanwhile prepublication coverage of the book has focused on talley’s very personal attack on wintour whom he says has inflicted “huge emotional scarring” on many including you again won’t be surprised to learn talley and – worse – “was never really passionate about clothes” caring only about power wintour more than anyone in the world can still make or destroy a designer’s career she is also a celebrity recognisable to even the most fashionphobic surely talley anticipated the fuss he would cause  facebook twitter pinterest with karl lagerfeld in 2005 photograph jemal countesswireimage for chanel  “i did not anticipate that at all one of my editors said to me ‘do you think anna wintour will talk to you after this comes out’ i said ‘yes of course why not’”  maybe because you write that she is not capable of “simple human kindness”  there is the briefest of pauses “well there’s always hope” he says  talley and wintour fell out in 2018 after he discovered he was no longer doing the red carpet interviews at the annual met gala or those for vogue’s podcast he was replaced at the met gala by liza koshy a young youtube star “what could this talented youtuber offer surely she didn’t know what a martingale back is to a balenciaga oneseamed coat” talley writes  he believes he was dropped because “i had suddenly become too old too overweight and too uncool” yet other vogue staffers of his generation – stylist grace coddington writer hamish bowles – have resisted dodo status by embracing social media and other shifts in the weather talley is on instagram but his page largely consists of references to the past photos of radziwill vreeland princess gloria the vogue of the 80s 90s and early 00s that he describes in his book when editors expensed their dry cleaning is like reading about the last days of the raj but you don’t get to be the longestserving editor of vogue without knowing when something is passé and wintour is ruthless “so much of it has to do with… having talent that’s right for the moment” she said in an interview last year referring to the way she casts her staff  but talley says he had accepted the world was changing “if anna had called and said ‘andré we’re thinking of going in a different direction for the met ball it’s important for our brand’ i would have said ‘fine that’s great’ and i’d have come in my tom ford cape – i always wear tom ford – and enjoyed my dinner” but she didn’t his former confidante had moved on and he writes he never “felt the love” from her  facebook twitter pinterest in a still from the 2018 film the gospel according to andré  the estrangement was a shock because the pair had been allies since they first met at vogue in 1983 when she was appointed editor in 1987 wintour made talley creative director he is very funny about the unspoken rules of working with her no meeting must last more than eight minutes food is not an essential part of lunch once they took a taxi to a restaurant ordered their meals and after 20 minutes wintour announced they were leaving before the first courses had come out  “food is not important to her so i learned to deal with that” talley says i can vouch for this i was once summoned to a “breakfast meeting” with wintour at the ritz in london it lasted precisely 25 minutes and we didn’t even get to coffee  but talley insists his book is “a love letter to anna wintour” in which case i’d hate to see what counts as hate mail he has he says “been wrapped in neglect” yet the book often suggests the opposite over the years wintour invited him to her first wedding and gave him her bouquet arranged an interestfree loan from condé nast so he could buy his grandmother’s house hired him back after he briefly left vogue in the 90s due to a previous unexplained falling out invited him to her children’s weddings  “yes and she did the intervention and condé nast paid for that” he says referring to the many times wintour packed him off to a health spa and instructed him to lose weight he did but put it straight back on  didn’t he feel bullied when she was constantly telling him he was too fat  “no i felt it showed great concern” he says  talley’s weight has been a problem since his grandmother died in 1989 and he binged on foods that reminded him of her “beautiful pineapple and coconut cakes pies virginia ham with cloves” he says with the same relish as when listing famous friends or describing designer outfits “i still have that crutch eating and it’s an addiction”  i ask if in an industry in which the one crime is to be fat maybe it was also a rebellion against his lunchaverse boss  “i never thought about that but i’m sure people were looking at me and thinking ‘how disgusting’ she was always sitting next to me but i wasn’t deliberately making myself bigger next to these small white women in power” he says  facebook twitter pinterest dancing with diana ross at studio 54 in 1979 photograph sonia moskowitzgetty images  things reached a head after talley stormed out of the 2018 met ball “it felt like i was just thrown under the bus it hurt” he says now  but maybe she thinks he dropped her he was the one who walked out  he ponders this briefly “well if that were the case she could call me to say ‘andré what’s wrong’ that’s what i would expect” he retorts  despite all this talley’s name still appears on vogue’s masthead as a contributing editor “i hope i’m still part of the vogue family – i haven’t been officially told i’m not” he says horrified at the thought and he probably is – after all wintour gave him the goahead to publish this book she read an early draft and asked only that he remove some private details about her children she knows being denounced as a shedevil is good for her brand she turned up to the premiere of the devil wears prada in yes prada while outsiders have long been transfixed by what talley calls wintour’s “sphinxlike looks” the funniest moments in his book come when we see just how much her staff also bought into the mythology in perhaps the weirdest scene wintour scribbles a thank you note to talley and he sends it to his framer so he can treasure it for ever alas the framer failed to appreciate its significance and chucked it away much to talley’s fury  isn’t it unusual to frame a casual note from someone you’ve worked with for decades i ask  “it was not an original idea us vogue fashion editor tonne goodman had a letter from anna framed” talley says  i suddenly feel rather sorry for wintour trying to get on with her job but surrounded by people frantically framing every postit she discards    talley’s book tells the story of his life which is often the story of the women who have supported him his grandmother vreeland annette de la renta carolina herrera radziwill and most of all wintour  i tell him it sounds as if he spent his life looking for mother figures maybe he forgot that wintour was his boss not his mother  “i have always looked for mother and father figures i had to look up to something to go forward” he says  a day later he sends an email to clarify “my mother figure to this day is my grandmother she gave me unconditional love and her home her values were my arc of safety”  talley was raised by his grandmother bennie frances davis while his parents worked in a different state as a child he was bullied by other kids but adored by bennie although he says she hugged him only twice in his childhood “too busy” yet she unblinkingly supported this little boy whose idea of a perfect day was to watch julia child cook on tv then wallpaper his room with pages torn from vogue  facebook twitter pinterest with italian model photographer and jewellery designer marina schiano in 1980 photograph images pressgetty images  his mother was a different matter “she never abandoned me but she didn’t understand me” she could be cruel and would mock his experiments with fashion which became analogous with escape  “every sunday i would walk across the railroad tracks into the affluent part of durham and buy vogue and harper’s bazaar and go back to my grandmother’s house read my magazines i was allowed to retreat from the bullying and the sexual abuse into a beautiful world” he says  talley never told anyone he was sexually abused as a child – not the therapists he has seen not even his beloved pastor but he felt with this book that it was time to explain himself  “it began when i was nine years of age and it was serial my whole life has been determined by this trauma i can say this now” he says  his first abuser was a man who lived on his street who would tell him “this is our secret game” later there were older brothers of friends he didn’t tell his grandmother because “it wasn’t something that could be discussed at the dinner table and i was afraid i might be considered the perpetrator and sent away to detention”  because of the abuse talley says he has never really had an intimate relationship in the late 70s he writes he attempted to go to bed with a french journalist “it was hopeless useless this idea of mounting an individual and causing what i had only known as deep discomfort he gave up and we got dressed” he has he says had romances with men and women as an adult “but i’ve not had them successfully i don’t know how to be intimate and in a relationship and i regret that it comes from this childhood trauma”  as a young man in new york he fled from gay bars horrified at the overt sexuality and preferring instead the chaste fun of dancing with diana ross at studio 54 instead of looking for sexual connection he would look for approval from people he admired and if he felt any emotional lack he “filled my life with luxury and the pursuit of education”  talley studied at north carolina central university then on a scholarship to the prestigious brown university got a master’s in french literature he is still rightly proud of this taking care to mention that he has “better degrees than anna wintour” it was at brown that he first met people connected to fashion and after graduating was taken under vreeland’s wing in new york from that point it was a dizzying upward rise working with andy warhol at interview magazine reporting from paris for women’s wear daily and then at last vogue  i never thought about being a man of colour in my career until recently now this is always in my mind  he felt “at home” in this overthetop world where “there were no victims only high octane egos” any insecurities could be hidden beneath another custommade suit during his first eight months in paris every time he got his weekly paycheck he marched straight to the vuitton store and bought another suitcase surround yourself with enough beauty and you’ll no longer think about ugliness – that’s the theory anyway talley instantly fell in love with the fashion set with their clearly defined rules you go to these nightclubs talk about those subjects use this lacquer on your suitcases  he didn’t think about being a black man in the white world of fashion “i earned my position not because i was a beautiful skinny – you can look at the pictures – articulate black man but because i had done my homework and my degrees i never thought about being a man of colour in my career until recently”  others were more conscious of it in the book talley reflects that in the 70s one fashion pr referred to him as “queen kong” around that same time a colleague accused him of being what he describes as “a black buck” and sleeping with every designer in paris in order to humiliate him out of his job it worked and talley mortified and furious returned to new york these days he says he feels a different responsibility as a man of colour “i’m a descendant of enslaved people and this is always in my mind whatever i articulate must in some way reflect who i am as a black man and what i can impart to the history of fashion as this black person who was able to be in the front row”  since he’s taken a step back he says his eyes have been opened to who his real friends are some – ford herrera – have stayed true others have not “i do think i’ve been dropped by miuccia prada that is a big surprise i have eight crocodile coats custommade for me by her but she has not kept in touch and that hurts me”  talley is not the first person to have confused possessions with love or a career with life “i don’t need any more stuff i have too much in my houses” he says then lists his favourite stuff including photos of himself with oprah winfrey a warhol silkscreen of vreeland “truman capote’s sofa” he couldn’t afford more stuff now anyway instead of being chauffeured everywhere as he was in his pomp a friend called chad gives him lifts to the supermarket  facebook twitter pinterest with naomi campbell in 1991 photograph george rosegetty images  for talley elegance is what he learned from vreeland and the beloved matriarchs of his past but fashion is about being heartlessly modern he says he doesn’t miss the status he had in his heyday but rather “the human fellowship of being on the front row” but the front row is a powerful signifier of status being there means you are one of the most important people in fashion and this kind of validation still matters to him to show love to his “dear friends” talley includes them in his list of bestdressed people wintour comes in at number one – but only when wearing chanel haute couture  talley and i have been talking for two hours and i would be happy to talk for 10 more fashion will be a blander place if it no longer has space for characters like him the expense accounts will probably be smaller but it will be a less exciting world despite his obsession with luxury and the fashion industry talley remains interested in everything nonfashion topics we touch on include the career of barbara stanwyck the songs of nina simone barry jenkins’ adaptation of james baldwin’s novel if beale street could talk anne glenconner’s bestselling memoir lady in waiting “exceptional i come from the opposite spectrum of the world but i compare my life to hers the gilded cage and the reality” does he ever think he would have been happier had he stayed in north carolina and worked as a teacher as vreeland once worried he’d do  “never never” he gasps “my story is a fairytale of excess and in every fairytale there is evil and darkness but you overcome it with light i want every person i come across – the stranger on the street the church member in the pew next to me – to feel love i have not been privy to love in my life but i want them to feel that they have received some love from engaging with me andré leon talley”']\n",

posits the film as an excoriation of american imperialism jumping off from the fact that its haunted hotel the overlook was built on a native american burial ground and continuing with other references and bricabrac to back it up can those cans of calumet baking powder be a coincidence others are mostly cockamamie like the theory that kubrick had made the film as an apologia for his role

igor to the director’s dr frankenstein – scoffed at the interpretations floated by room 237 but it was never the point of the documentary to convince the audience to buy into any one take on the shining its deeper purpose was to celebrate the shining as a glorious enigma a film that invites grand unifying theories without ever quite affirming any of them we’re no closer to figuring it out now

book but the recent adaptation of king’s sequel doctor sleep leans heavily into the film’s iconography but the bafflement is baked into the pie – it’s what makes the film so primally terrifying and unsettling to experience and what teases the brain into trying to solve it  facebook twitter pinterest jack nicholson and stanley kubrick on the set photograph murray closesygma via getty images  the astonishing opening shots of jack wending his way up the colorado mountains are a sign of things to come wendy carlos and rachel elkind’s eerie moog interpretation of hector berlioz’s symphonie fantastique the mirroring of the landscape against a placid lake and most crucially the breathless whoosh of the camera with steadicam mounts finally available to combine movement with stability kubrick experiments as much as any film since in what a constantly roving camera could do to unmoor an audience even in the relatively benign early scenes of jack heading to the interview or the whole torrance clan including his wife wendy shelley duvall and son danny danny lloyd getting a tour of the hotel it feels like a game of chicken as if the camera were zooming headlong into danger and we can’t be assured it will ever swerve away  as the torrances settle into the overlook for the winter and a snowstorm severs their connection to the outside world the madness that quickly seizes jack – too quickly many critics at the time griped – starts to ramp up a whole strategy of disorientation kubrick makes a joke out of titles announcing different days of the week as if time has any meaning in isolation and the geography of the overlook is impossible to map despite or because of the many shots of danny rolling through the hallways on his big wheel the kitchen the living quarters the gold room the upper floors where the previous caretaker axed his own family the dreaded room 237 — all distinct spaces but there’s no guessing how they all connect  kubrick’s sense of humor is one of his less appreciated qualities even in noncomedies like barry lyndon or eyes wide shut and the shining relishes the opportunity to goof on the horror genre whether through the flourishes of nicholson’s performance “heeeeeere’s johnny” or the odyssey of the overlook’s head chef scatman crouthers who answers danny’s psychic sos only to get an axe in the chest however viewers might expect a horror film to behave kubrick seems hellbent on defying it whether that means creating dreamlike cascades of blood around an elevator bank flashing on scenes of past carnage or just having a laugh over the expectation that the chef’s long rescue mission will amount to anything  every rewatch of the shining seems to trigger a new obsession often depending on who’s doing the watching or when kubrick’s treatment of duvall for example has gotten renewed scrutiny in light of abuses against women in the film industry and so witnessing her raw vulnerability as wendy the one nonpossessed member of the torrance family feels like a grim twist on method performance watching the shining under covid19 quarantine too makes it seems like an uncanny echo of the anxious state of isolation where the days are blurry and borderless and a cavernous hotel can feel as confined as a studio apartment even those in their right mind are now a little better acquainted with madness  facebook twitter pinterest shelley duvall in the shining photograph allstarcinetextwarner bros  of the theories swirling around the shining the one that seems the most plausible 40 years later is the overlook as a metaphor for the horrors wrought by the american elite which ties into the cloistered world of kubrick’s eyes wide shut and his careerlong skepticism of the powerful in touring the place jack is told that the overlook was “one of the stopping places for the jet set” where all sorts of important people had stayed including four presidents and surely made consequential decisions as they were perched on high hearing about the hotel being built on a native american burial ground may add the threat of retribution from beyond the grave but kubrick suggests this desecration is the original sin like an evil embedded in the hotel’s foundation  “all the best people” stayed at the overlook jack is told and where have you heard that phrase before the hotel has a presence – a shining – that’s frightening to those who are sensitive to it like the chef and danny but it’s scariest of all for being both irredeemable and indestructible jack having been there before and jack attempting more or less the same murder as a previous caretaker is a sign that history will keep on repeating itself and for the powerful people who vacation there these are the rooms where it happens the sad truth about the overlook is that what happened to the torrances will probably get cleaned up for the next season and turn into a cautionary anecdote for the next halfcracked caretaker who wants the job the carnage never ends']\n",

shelves and covid19 inspired a homebaking boom while google searches for “bread” tripled in the uk in the weeks after midmarch those for “sourdough” rose sixfold sourdough differs from most bread in that it contains no baker’s yeast relying instead on a fermented “starter” of water and flour to provide lift this also provides its sour flavour and chewy texture  it could be the reduced availability of baker’s yeast in shops or perhaps the timepoor with a theoretical interest in sourdough finally found time to don their aprons whatever the reason the sourdough revival has gone into overdrive vanessa kimbell author of the sourdough school and regular contributor to radio 4’s the food programme says she has seen a 50 increase in instagram followers and a 25 increase in membership of her online sourdough club and that “the phone hasn’t stopped ringing”  facebook twitter pinterest san francisco’s josey baker locals insist the city’s environment gives their sourdough a unique taste but scientists counter that the microbes involved are found globally photograph dpaalamy  however many sourdough newbies have found that producing beautiful tasty loaves isn’t as easy as it looks on social media maybe it’s time for a new approach the transformation of dough into a light and airy loaf is after all chemistry in action with a good side of physics the complex relationships between the yeasts and bacteria that power starter fermentation are the domain of the microbiologist whether you’re a beginner left holding bricks that taste of dough or an accomplished amateur looking to further up your game perhaps what you need is a refresher in the science of sourdough  what should i feed my starter  to replace the baker’s yeast that most breads need to rise sourdough requires some starter – a selfsustaining fermentation of flour water wild yeasts and bacteria that produce lactic and acetic acids you might be able to get some starter from a local baker or you can make your own – by combining small equal quantities of water and flour and letting it ferment for around five days  once you have established a starter you need to feed and maintain it with additional flour and water allpurpose refined wheat flour can be used most enthusiasts prefer stoneground wholegrain flours because they contain more of the microbes and enzymes needed to drive fermentation they can however make a starter higher maintenance requiring precise timing of feeding many opt for a more forgiving rye flourbased starter and some use flour blends  “when i fed our starter sifted bread and whole wheat flours it would ebb and flow in health activity and consistency” says san francisco baker josey baker yes that’s his real name “i’ve had the best luck with wholegrain rye flour which seemed to stabilise it in a way that has worked very well for us for years” an underperforming wheat flour starter that has lost its vigour can be pepped up with a rye flour boost some mix in extras like grapes or yoghurt though this isn’t necessary if you’re using good flour  facebook twitter pinterest some bakers add yoghurt or grapes to their starters to boost the bacterial content of their dough purists say this is unnecessary photograph catherine hogginsalamy  how does my starter’s diet affect bread flavour  flours consist mostly of starch 7080 and proteins 1015 during fermentation enzymes in the flour break the starch apart into smaller more digestible units making sugars available to yeasts and bacteria the microbes digest these sugars generating carbon dioxide acids and alcohol as byproducts  ryebased starters attract more heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria which produce vinegary acetic acid and give bread sour fruity flavours wheat flours encourage homofermentative lactic acid bacteria which only produce lactic acid making for softer cereal flavours while wholewheat adds a malty nutty taste  use of more water and warm weather encourages microbes that will generate a sweetertasting loaf to add sourness rest your dough in the fridge possibly overnight as lower temperatures favour the activity of bacteria that produce acetic acid  where do the microbes in my starter come from  some bakers in san francisco which is famous for its sourdough swear their loaves can’t be produced elsewhere there is a species of lactic acid bacteria called lactobacillus sanfranciscensis which produces a characteristically sour flavour although it has been found in sourdoughs across the world  scientists at north carolina state university ncsu used dna sequencing to identify the microbes in starters sent to them by more than 500 participants in their global sourdough project “we found there is incredible diversity across different sourdoughs even those from the same neighbourhoods” says microbiologist dr anne madden of ncsu in a followup study the team asked 18 bakers from 14 countries to make starters using the same flour and method and then assembled them in belgium to make bread the microbes in their starters were most similar to those in the flour they used but were also reflected in those found on the bakers’ hands “this suggests an intimate relationship” says madden “either the hands are adding microbes to the starters or the starters are adding microbes to the hands” the group hope to find out more through the wild sourdough project launched in april in which they are asking citizen scientists to make starters and record their characteristics  facebook twitter pinterest kneading boosts the development of gluten in the dough the key factor in giving a loaf the good structure that will help it rise properly photograph victoriahunteralamy stock photo  should i knead or stretch and fold  it depends whether you need your bread by lunchtime despite much talk to the contrary there is no gluten in dry flour rather it contains proteins called gliadin and glutenin which once hydrated combine to form gluten which can absorb twice its weight in water it is also sticky stretchy and elastic the strength and structure of a good loaf rests on a scaffolding of fine strands of gluten “your gluten network acts like a balloon that keeps the gas produced by the yeast inside” says karl de smedt who runs a library of sourdoughs in st vith belgium the collection currently maintains 128 sourdoughs from 25 countries some of which date back to the 19th century “without a good gluten network your bread cannot rise and you will end up with a brick” adds de smedt  kneading adds energy and oxygen to dough speeding the development of the gluten allowing speedier baking in “no knead” recipes edges of the dough are stretched and folded back in and then left to develop this process is repeated several times before the dough is left to swell for a longer period “you only need to knead if you want to be quick” says kimbell “but if you give your dough a proper vigorous mix you can also let the gluten develop during a long slow fermentation”  how do i get a more open crumb  lots of factors affect the “crumb” or internal structure of your loaf many amateur bakers want to know how to produce lighter bread with larger holes “to achieve a very open crumb you need a good flour with a high protein say 1316” says de smedt “this allows you to produce a nice gluten network which is responsible for retaining the gas”  the water content of your dough is also key beginners often slop in too much too quickly and then panic when their dough becomes gloopy and so throw in extra flour kimbell’s top tip is to start with about threequarters of the water in your recipe mix slowly and add splashes as you go greater water content makes for softer dough and bigger bubbles “it is easier to blow up a balloon with thin skin than one with thick skin and by adding more water your dough becomes more like a thin balloon” says de smedt  facebook twitter pinterest vanessa kimbell and her dutch oven trapping water vapour during baking can delay crust formation this allows the loaf to ferment and expand for longer photograph georgia de lotz  if you want larger air pockets be gentle when handling your dough otherwise you’ll knock out the gas needed to make them but while big holes make for nice instagram pictures some focus on structure at the expense of more important attributes “any fool can make big holes once they understand gluten and water” says kimbell “the true art is in creating something that is complex soft tender nourishing with both sweetness and light sourness”  why do i need steam during baking  sugars and amino acids on the loaf’s surface start to react at about 150c in the maillard reaction a process that gives seared foods a distinctive taste and colouring add steam into the oven and it will condense on the cold surface of your loaf and delay crust formation keeping the bread’s surface flexible for longer allows for a final burst of fermentation and gas bubble production while also allowing existing bubbles to expand it allows the loaf to stretch so that it becomes light and airy many cook their sourdough in a dutch oven or under a cloche to trap water vapour from the dough and create steam  is sourdough healthier than baker’s yeast bread  the lactic acids in sourdough neutralise phytates in flour that when consumed in large amounts can prevent the body absorbing minerals such as iron calcium magnesium and zinc in bread they also slow the release of glucose into the bloodstream lowering the bread’s glycemic index and preventing insulin spikes the lactic acids also make gluten more digestible and reduce the chances of gluten intolerance a study published in december by prof marco gobbetti of the free university of bozenbolzano in italy found sourdough to be more digestible than bread made with baker’s yeast sourdough fermented for longer periods made healthy individuals feel more full more quickly and those who ate sourdough had higher amino acid concentrations in their blood  is making sourdough a science or an art  that depends who is making it de smedt believes it is best approached as a science josey baker believes that to do it properly requires both perspectives “ultimately bread is made not in labs but in homes and bakeries by people with subjective opinions using their skills intuitions emotions and other intangibles that science doesn’t attempt to address” he says “if you’re trying to make bread relying only on one or the other then you’re leaving something important out”  kimbell agrees that while science can point bakers in the right direction there’s much more to making a great sourdough loaf than manipulating variables based on data analysis “you can totally geek out on the amazing science of the microbial fermentation

babies were born in america in 2019 down 1 from the previous year birthrates dropped among women of basically every age and race group but rose slightly among women in their early 40s  the total fertility rate which estimates the number of births that a hypothetical group of 1000 women would have over their lifetime is also at a record low american women are now projected to have about 171 children over their lifetimes which is below the rate of 21 needed to completely replace a generation  it doesn’t take a genius to figure out why americans are having fewer kids the government makes a big song and dance about how much it loves fetuses but it is actively hostile to parents the us is the only oecd country without national statutory paid maternity paternity or parental leave for one thing then there’s the financial cost of simply delivering the kid america is the most expensive place in the world to have a baby – and it may be one of the only places in the world where hospitals charge you just for holding your child one couple found a 3935 charge on their hospital bill for “skintoskin” contact after their baby was born  because of the kafkaesque nature of america’s healthcare system it’s hard to pin down how much the cost of an average birth is but one 2013 estimate put it at around 32093 that’s just for an uncomplicated vaginal birth by the way if you have a complicated pregnancy and bad or no insurance you can very easily find yourself getting bankrupted by the medical bills  once you have the child you have to deal with astronomical childcare costs the atlantic notes that since the 1990s childcare costs have grown twice as fast as overall inflation the average cost of a fulltime childcare program is now 16000 a year – which in some states is more than university tuition meanwhile many millennial parents are still paying off their own student debt  while there have been a lot of jokes about a coronavirus baby boom experts think it is likely that the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic will cause birth rates to drop further now more than ever kids are becoming a luxury only a few can afford  lana del rey engages in some

camila cabello cardi b kehlani nicki minaj and beyoncé of having “had number ones with songs about being sexy wearing no clothes fucking cheating etc” i’m not sure exactly what del rey was trying to communicate as her instagram post was sort of incomprehensible however it sounded a lot like she was saying that beyoncé et al are morons who have had it easy while del rey is a very serious artist who has been vilified and called antifeminist by the press for glamourizing abuse in her lyrics after a lot of backlash del rey is now insisting she’s not a racist she’s just a very serious artist who seems to have a problem with successful black women  speaking of alison roman …  she’s been placed on temporary leave by the new york times following her disparaging comments about chrissy teigen and

ailments donald trump has inflicted on his own country – not to mention the rest of the world – there may be something even worse than hydroxycholoroquine  has trump been trying out his own dodgy medical advice it would explain a few things  arwa mahdawi read more  yes it’s bad that he claims to be taking an antimalarial that his own food and drug administration says is unsafe and ineffective to treat covid19  yes it’s astonishing that trump’s tools forced out of office an actual vaccine expert because he dared to question the president’s love of an unproven drug  but it’s even worse that he is a oneman delivery vehicle for a dunce cult that denies science  we’re not just talking about the presidential brainwaves that bounced around the world hitting bodies with very powerful light or bleaching patients “by injection inside or almost a cleaning”  trump’s antiscience cult does not begin with quack remedies for a pandemic and it does not even begin with him  he represents the nadir of a long tradition of conspiracyloving wingnuts who used to populate the fringes of the american conservative movement over the last halfcentury they have moved steadily into the mainstream of the republican party where their factfree fairytales about the evil establishment have found a natural home in the cranium of the 45th president  in this age of hyperconnected ignorance there are no independent experts and there are no true facts your scientific theories are equal to my twitter theories just as your fbi investigation into russia is equal to rudy’s supposed investigation into ukraine all opinions are equal but some are more equal than others  how can you deny this democracy of dunces when there are supposedly experts on both sides brad parscale the ferraridriving trump campaign manager slapped down the science of covid19 cures by citing the work of a respectablesounding group of doctors  “the press is going nuts over realdonaldtrump taking hydroxychloroquine prescribed by doctor of course if he’s doing it they must oppose it” he tweeted on tuesday “but the association of american physicians  surgeons says otherwise”  parscale linked to a story on the aaps website about the group’s letter to the arizona governor citing its own “frequently updated table of studies” of the drug claiming it has “about a 90 chance of helping covid19 patients”  what kind of crazy medical cabal is keeping such a powerful drug from dying patients  the aaps has a long record of exposing the obvious malevolence of mainstream medicine as part of its mission to keep government out of healthcare it took a bold stand against the science that hiv causes aids citing “official reports and the peerreviewed literature”  it also blew open the science of how barack obama was using mass hypnosis to bamboozle voters with his fancy speeches apparently the o of his campaign logo resembled a crystal ball which explains why so many jews supported obama if you think that’s crazy you should take a look at “a 66page extensively footnoted but unsigned article” that inspired the aaps article  the aaps counts fewer than 5000 members compared with more than 220000 members of its archenemy the american medical association but it’s quality not quantity that counts among its past members the aaps counts rand paul the ophthalmologist who now serves as one of the few doctors in the us senate his kooky libertarian father ron a former obgyn was also a member  there’s ample evidence that most republicans think scientists should butt out of public policy  this is a shame because there are only 17 doctors among the 535 members of congress and 14 of them are republicans at a time when the nation and the world would appreciate some informed medical opinions in the middle of a onceinageneration pandemic  instead there’s ample evidence that most republicans think scientists should butt out of public policy before the pandemic struck recent polling showed that just 43 of republicans think that scientists should play an active role in policy debates compared with 73 of democrats  even fewer republicans – 34 – think scientists are any better at making decisions about science policy than you or me  these opinions did not crawl out of the primordial soup on their own they have evolved over time in a warm bath of fringe conspiracy groups that have spent decades fighting against the teaching of evolution among other social evils one of those groups was phyllis schlafly’s eagle forum which worked to push evolution out of the classroom almost as doggedly as mrs america fought against women’s rights and the equal rights amendment  so it’s no surprise to find her son andrew named as general counsel to the aaps among other projects andrew schlafly founded a conservative alternative to wikipedia to correct its “liberal bias” on things like evolution  schlafly’s group was not alone its brotherinarms was the anticommie anticivil rights john birch society which phyllis somehow believed was not sufficiently concerned about the soviet union  today the birchers believe that among the many globalist plots against america – led by the un of course – is a vast scientific conspiracy the biggest one naturally is the supposed science about the climate crisis but if you’re at all confused the birchers’ website cites “conspiracy” as the first thing that bothers them about science  “by definition a conspiracy is when two or more people work in secret for evil purposes the john birch society believes this definition fits a number of groups working against the independence of the united states” its website declares about science “extensive study has shown us that history is rarely accidental”  extensive studies are everywhere if you know where to look it was no accident of history that barack obama recently tried to hypnotize young americans by warning that the fools who ignored the pandemic were also ignoring the climate crisis  “we’ve seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic” he tweeted “we can’t afford any more consequences of climate denial”  his successor is immune to this kind of mind control known as logic especially when it comes to testing for covid19 for trump the number of tests is both a remarkable triumph – the biggest in the world – and also a remarkable admission of failure you see if you test more you find more sickness it’s like a scientific plot conspiring against him much like the negative hydroxy study that he called “a trumpenemy statement”  “by doing testing you’re finding people” he explained to a couple of governors and reporters on wednesday before bragging again that the us was testing more people than germany and south korea “so we’re way ahead of everybody but when you do that you have more cases so a lot of times the fake news media will say ‘you know there are a lot of cases in the united states’ well if we didn’t do testing at a level that nobody has ever dreamt possible you wouldn’t have very many cases”  this was a genius strategy first perfected by a teenager hiding under his bed covers to avoid homework but then one of those fake news reporters asked trump about a per capita comparison with countries like germany and south korea  “you know when you say ‘per capita’ there’s many per capitas” said trump “it’s like per capita relative to what but you can look at just about any category and we’re really at the top meaning positive on a percapita basis too”  at this point of his presidency there’s a whole team of antiscience vectors called trump officials  per capita would be relative to the capita in any normal universe but “scientists” may have also discovered signs of a parallel universe where everything is backward including time itself that’s the universe trump came from through a wormhole that leads directly to maralago  it’s far bigger than one president though at this point of his presidency there’s a whole team of antiscience vectors called trump officials among them is the white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany who promised to never lie to the media but who managed to slam them all the same for what she called “apoplectic coverage of hydroxycholoroquine” on tuesday  “and interestingly i found this out just before coming here” she explained “hydroxychloroquine of course is an fdaapproved medication with a longproven track record for safety”  well kayleigh you make a great point the fda has approved lots of medications like chemotherapy drugs that will actually kill you if you selfprescribe so maybe the scientists are wrong about everything  america’s founding fathers knew we’d end up in this place “facts are stubborn things” john adams declared in his successful defense of the hated british soldiers responsible for the boston massacre “whatever may be our wishes our inclinations or the dictates of our passions they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence” he said 250 years ago  then again adams thought that democracy was doomed because of the power of the plebeian mob “remember democracy never lasts long” he wrote “it soon wastes exhausts and murders itself there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide”  if not by quack medicine then by the conspiracy theories of a president who believes in trumpenemy science']\n",

sickness in no way does that break my stride when it comes to the buffet  clapping the nhs is all very well but with my sister on the frontline i need to speak up  hadley freeman read more  there is a current strain of thought that if you complain about sacrifices required during the lockdown you are saying you do not support it but to wish your children could go back to school is not disregarding the importance of teachers’ health to long for the shops to reopen is not wishing illness on older people because you want to buy a new skirt we can acknowledge the pain while also accepting the reality so i understand why the breakfast buffet may be no more but i still mourn its demise  hotel breakfast buffets are important because they are an essential part of the illusion that anything is permitted if you do it in a hotel – from staying up until 3am watching movies to eating seven helpings of waffle six hours later the buffet is where you meet your fellow guests so that for the rest of the holiday you think of them as mr salmon and mrs yoghurt where you learn that some people are fine with mixing cold and hot food on one plate and that if the omelette station runs dry riots will

you’re really sure it’s what you want” and in what felt like seconds later there i was in a peckham computer exchange shop queuing furtively for a secondhand xbox one with a couple of reliably blockbuster games to go with it  the first weeks were a blend of ironic detachment and oppressive nostalgia it felt acceptable to limit myself to a few hours of fifa or gta 5 each week with their

natural landscapes and sublime vistas is soothing in its certainties an effective distraction from the world outside  like most things i suppose this response to the present has roots in the deep past of my own life as with so many children of my generation i was enamoured with computer games there was certainly no embarrassment about this fixation in my tightknit friendship circle when my mother

conducive to the transition into coaching  facebook twitter pinterest charlie strong had yet to coach his first game at the university of texas when an influential booster called his hiring a “kick in the face” during a radio interview he was fired after three seasons photograph tom penningtongetty images  the overwhelmingly conservative billionaire cadre of nfl owners who have the final say on these hires are in the same extended old boys’ club as the university trustees perpetuating the pattern in college flatly stated the lack of minority representation in positions of power is debilitating toward any meaningful push for diversity “college coaches are expected to fundraise and schmooze with alumni as well as coach” says mark naison a professor of african american studies and history at fordham university “the rich alumni most of whom are white feel more comfortable with people who look like them so long as alumni dollars drive college football funding white coaches will have a huge hiring advantage”  what the ncaa can and should do is address the problem from the ground up by creating more opportunities for minorities in athletic departments and designating scholarships for students of color that are interested in sportsrelated careers relying on the intermittent largesse of those in power just isn’t cutting it  the rooney rule despite its notorious lack of efficacy is a net positive because it gives minority coaches the opportunity to at least get in front of teams and impress them after a candidate interviews once or twice they can know what to expect and be better prepared for the process in the future  but the systemic barriers to entry that have been installed over more than a century of organized football can’t be undone with a flick of the pen at the end of the day the people that put trump in office are the same trustees on those boards and the same people that own nfl teams  another less obvious roadblock as one african american assistant currently on an nfl coaching staff explained to me is that many white head coaches simply don’t know nearly as many of their black counterparts they don’t want to lose the black coaches they have and are comfortable with he says which often leads to black coaches being held back out of their superior’s selfinterest while he disagrees with the nfl’s shelved plan of offering teams draft selections for hiring coaches of color he would support the awarding of compensatory picks for promoting minorities from within the organization another suggestion shutting down or at least somehow regulating the rampant culture of nepotism that enables family members of coaches to skip the process over guys who have a track record of success in the league wouldn’t hurt  “clearly we are not where we want to be on this level” goodell said in january “it’s clear we need to change and do something different there’s no reason to expect we’re going to have a different outcome next year without those kinds of changes”  admitting you have a problem is the first step but getting the nfl where it needs to be on diversity while not impossible is a heavier ask than anyone wants to admit']\n",

that although as it happens there has been a background drip of this kind of thing around the last dance the blockbusting netflix series documenting the incredible untold story of michael jordan winning at basketball while people tell him he’s great and he pretends to be nice  come back again just a joke but this has been a realworld subplot to the success of the last dance a public response that has veered between unconditional reverence to a kind of culturewars inventory of the personal politics of the film’s star as the final episodes aired this week there was a minor chorus of chicago bulls teammates dismayed at their own portrayal as extras plot devices in the jordan supremacy  scottie pippen said to be beyond livid at jordan for portrayal in the last dance read more  as a longdistance fan it has been fascinating to watch this play out partly this is wrapped up in the simple pleasure of observing a certain type of highgrade tearfully earnest american sports journalist address their subject the kind of american journalist who talks about sport as though it’s a cross between the moon landings and a childhood trauma on a fishing trip  add to this reverent tone the fact that jordan is also a cultural icon that to offer even tempered praise is to take a stance against a certain kind of orthodoxy that thing you like it’s complicated  two main questions have cropped up the first is the issue raised this week by former teammate horace grant and indeed sotto voce by the film itself is michael jordan actually a hypercompetitive sociopath is the greatest athlete in modern american sport some kind of superstar bully  and secondly is this actually a documentary film at all given jordan’s editorial control or just a hugely enjoyable advert for shoes  first up it is worth stating the obvious the last dance is a sensationally good sports film whatever the answers to these questions the storytelling is thrillingly detailed and performative too the beauty of basketball lies in its interlocking details the way players skills tactics and backstories elide in a snapshot creating that dizzyingly rich athletic ballet this is what the series gives you a lavish beautifully constructed courtside seat it is whatever else a love letter to its sport  towards the end someone poisons him with a doctored pizza and you think yeah well ok  it is easy to get carried away by this richness as it progressed i found myself consumed with affection for assorted new favourite guys among the relentlessly charismatic array of former players first up there’s scottie pippen the heart of the film who has something irresistibly stern and upright about him and who is said to be disappointed no doubt in that weary frontierpreacher kind of way by his own portrayal  then there’s mild steely steve kerr who looks like a smalltown orthodontist but appears also to be one of the nicest hypercompetitive athletes to have walked the earth and obviously there’s dennis rodman just for the sheer luminous glory the perfect blend of hardheaded elite dedication and going to the wrestling and pretending to hit someone with a chair  in fact i wanted to be friends with all of them all except michael i wanted michael to distrust me to hate me but finally and through gritted teeth to admit that he grudgingly respects me  admittedly this probably won’t end up happening but it does lead us back to that first question is jordan the manturnedlogo the inspiration to millions actually a bit of a dick the answer is obvious yes he is but it doesn’t matter in fact this is in many ways the best part of the film  and let’s be clear jordan is a wonderful dick he’s fantastic at it at one point reggie miller recalls with awed amusement playing jordan in his rookie year miller gets turned over in the final quarter as they walk off jordan tells him “don’t ever talk trash to black jesus”  the last dance is the michael jordan documentary a dressedup puff piece read more  later jordan punches small kindly steve “i hit him right in the fucking eye” wants to apologise doesn’t actually have his teammate’s number but finally convinces steve that he michael is actually cool with it all so basically stfu “from that point on our relationship dramatically improved” steve confirms  there are moments where some merelyverygood pro basketball player talks about a defining moment in his life the one game where he made some small mark on greatness mike is shown watching on a tablet hooting and laughing towards the end someone poisons him with a doctored pizza and you think yeah well ok  but again this is fine this is what being relentlessly great at sport sometimes looks like it may sit poorly with the urge to lionise and fanworship but plenty of elite sportspeople have something wild about them the sharp obsessive edge that drives you to become this astonishingly good at something so reductively simple  it just happens jordan has the onceinalifetime talent and drive to live this personality to its fullest expression there are no restraints no boundaries as long as you keep winning how are we expecting him to come across at the end of this  sign up to the recap our weekly email of editors’ picks  the interesting point here is how this feeds into question two this isn’t really a documentary or a work of journalism it’s a hagiography it was always meant to be jordan is sport’s most valuable brand his company made the film that thing you like it’s also an advert  but even this works the bits where jordan tells us things in spite of himself are also the best parts the hero of this film is a sporting genius but he’s also an unreliable narrator a narrator who gives away more than you expect  these glimpses of how it might feel to be caught in the glow of all that excess brilliance are what makes the last dance not just spectacular but a version of some other truth that still seems to be playing itself out

the world quickly achieving cultcinema status but it was in its home country where its impact was most indelible the first french banlieue outercity film to receive any serious media attention it essentially created a new genre in french cinema and widened the scope of characters represented on screen to the country’s immigrant underclass it had touched a raw nerve something beyond even police violence the vast gulf of incomprehension between these concrete bastions packed with the neglected immigrant community and white mainstream france the sense both parties were ignoring a burning fuse telling themselves as per the film’s famous motto “jusqu’ici tout va bien” “so far so good … ”  the outraged reaction to the film showed it had hit home it won best director at cannes in 1995 but the

effects of this diversity push taghmaoui carved out a solid international career as a blockbuster bitplayer and koundé has been largely restricted to theatre and tv soaps it was the white man on the screen cassel who went on to become the most famous french actor of his generation kassovitz meanwhile has juggled acting and directing – including a pair of hollywood features and an unlikely swerve into heartthrob territory when he costarred in amélie but he has struggled to bring his militant convictions to the screen with the same force  this lack of broader political impact especially where les cités are concerned is the weight round la haine’s neck on the surface little has changed there in 25 years – and in racist attitudes towards their arab and black residents police “slipups” still occur with depressing regularity and riots still break out most notably in the nationwide 2005 unrest kassovitz is scathing about the recent discovery of brutal french policing tactics by the gilet jaunes yellow vests – whose base is primarily white and workingclass “now they understand the riot police aren’t racist they’re riot police if you’re part of a riot they will kick your ass and all of a sudden the gilet jaunes realise ‘oh shit it’s not ’cos the banlieue rioters were black it’s because they were fighting for something’ but back then it was ‘you can do that to the black kids but not to us’ and now they go crazy fuck them” he concludes “you know which people aren’t part of the gilets jaunes people from the cités because they understand”  he says it isn’t surprising an underpaid undertrained police force often resorts to violence when policing trouble spots that they are only to blame for their refusal to root out “black sheep” in their own ranks but he is adamant that his film made it harder for malpractice to go unnoticed “if we didn’t do what we did it would be duckhunting season we created copwatch we got people on their toes so that when they see a cop in the street mistreating people they say ‘you cannot do that’”  aurélie cardin has one misgiving about la haine “you know how it’s going to end badly that determinism is hammered in you live like this and you’ll always live like this that revolt wasn’t necessary because we’d lost before we’d begun it was hard for those who were living it we said to ourselves what are we supposed to do” she sees more hope in les misérables which despite a shared air of fatalism ends on an open question maybe it’s also the return of a direct political rallying cry from a genre whose recent advances have been in terms of who is represented on screen  kassovitz isn’t optimistic about a politician – or a single film – rectifying the underlying social conditions any time soon “you don’t change society in 25 years” he says “you need society to go all the way and collapse and then you change it you can’t change a machine that is perfect capitalism it’s not good but it’s perfect it’s working” he plans to turn la haine into a stage musical or “urban opera” as he puts it he originally envisioned the film’s little social vignettes as rap songs and this is the form they will take on stage but he is still holding firm on not making a true sequel impossible he says as its three heroes are “dead or in prison”  the coronavirus has laid bare once again the social inequality in the banlieues between 1 march and 20 april for example the death rate in the area of seinesaintdenis was up 130 on the same period in 2019 compared to a rise of 27 for france as a whole kassovitz sees the pandemic as one last chance to restructure society more fairly to break with “jusqu’ici tout va bien” “either people are going to say ‘we can’t go back to living like that’ or they’re going to go back to that and fuck them if they want to go to the slaughterhouse without doing anything” as in his most celebrated work he sets the countdown “it’s the last call for our society if we fuck this up i give us 50 years max fifty horrible years”  la haine will be rereleased by the bfi later this year']\n",

            "['328', 'the 1975 notes on a conditional form review – an uncertain record for uncertain times', 'the 1975’s notes on a conditional form is an album that thanks you not to classify it long delayed running at roughly 80 minutes and featuring cameos – including vintage dancehall mc cutty ranks urging listeners to “mash up de place” and greta thunberg inciting civil disobedience – it has been touted as the concluding episode of a sequence of albums known collectively as “music for cars”  as singer matty healy tells it this fourth album by the 1975 was initially conceived as a nostalgic hymn to the british nighttime of his youth “the beauty of the m25” and “going to mcdonald’s and listening to garage records in a haze in a peugeot 206” later he characterised notes… as “emo” whether that meant the makeup and howling of the album’s most rabblerousing track people or the more nuanced content further in is a moot point this set has room for both and more besides never quite settling on a unifying theme  having then already released no fewer than four of its 22 tracks the band only finished tinkering with the album in february unsurprisingly notes on a conditional form sprawls it starts political but doesn’t maintain momentum it ends up personal with a midpaced track called guys in which healy expresses his gratitude to his bandmates  a sense of ‘too much all the time’ has always pervaded their songs  passages of quite abstract beauty hand off to more radiofriendly tracks such as if you’re too shy let me know which finds room for celestial arpeggios van halen guitars and a discussion of facetime sex the 80sfest concludes in a sax solo elsewhere 90s tropes abound then because she goes finds the band gazing at their shoes  but if anything distinguishes notes on a conditional form from their back catalogue it is the sense that the 1975 are mining the heritage of british urban music the ticklish beats of twostep and uk garage recur on multiple tracks it’s as though drummer producer and healy coconspirator george daniel is giving vent to his inner jamie xx on tunes such as frail state of mind and yeah i know  the former finds healy behaving badly and then selfcastigating – an abiding theme in 1975 songs the latter is a hardertoparse collage which mixes environmental concern “live on mars fuck it up” with more generalised unease the distant echo of cutty ranks meanwhile features on shiny collarbone arguments around homage and cultural appropriation have rightfully simmered in the wider pop discourse here daniel and healy are just on the side of the angels seeking to expand their palette and deploying those influences with enough precision to avoid the accusation of tokenism  if music of black origin is one obvious identifier the presence of guests is another the 1975 don’t collaborate often most of the external voices here are female not only does thunberg starkly state that “all political movements in their present form have failed” but us singersongwriter phoebe bridgers lights up the folksy jesus christ 2005 god bless america a nonbinary love song “i’m in love with the girl next door” she sings as a fanfare of brass cheers in the distance most significantly fka twigs drops by she and healy are now romantically entwined  don’t worry by contrast was written by healy’s actor father tim and brings succour and – despite the layers of autotune  a blast of conventionality that reminds you how nimble eclectic and nourishing his son’s group are  in some ways this sprawl is innate to the 1975 a sense of “too much all the time” has always pervaded their songs healy plays with rock and boy band tropes and pings wildly between irony and sincerity here he errs more towards the latter emotion or at least a good facsimile of it  throwing everything at the listener – ambient passages funkpop – was first essayed on the 1975’s second album i like it when you sleep for you are so beautiful and so unaware of it on their last outing 2018’s a brief inquiry into online relationships the 1975 tackled the iniquities of a constantly mediated life succeeding in communicating the brio sexting and dread of a generation whose virtuality was as real as their groins  matty healy ‘i’m not an avocado – not everyone thinks i’m amazing’ read more  here uncertainty and anomie sing the loudest nothing revealedeverything denied is the key track “i don’t find what i’m looking for” sings healy subtly updating u2’s i still haven’t found what i’m looking for with nods to soul gospel and hiphop  the overarching concept of notes… – blasting tunes from car stereos sitting with one’s feelings pitchshifting as many vocals as possible – doesn’t quite arc gracefully enough to cover all its disparate moods healy being clean might account for some of the change of pace perhaps notes is really just home to tunes that didn’t fit the previous brief  the lp’s scattershot nature is no failure per se it does mesh well with the longueurs of lockdown but unlike a brief inquiry… whose bangers just kept coming notes is less extroverted more unstable more conditional this might in the long run be progress ultimately though a brief inquiry is a hard album to top and notes is perhaps the most disjointed and unclassifiable of the 1975’s works it serves best perhaps as a long and intermittently lovely outro to that defining

talks about her fight for plant rights and why she hopes the pandemic will increase human compassion for the natural world  “this is a time to take a lesson from mosses” says robin wall kimmerer celebrated writer and botanist her first book published in 2003 was the natural and cultural history book gathering moss she grins as if thinking of a dogged old friend or mentor “what is it that has enabled them to persist for 350m years through every kind of catastrophe every climate change that’s ever happened on this planet and what might we learn from that” she lists the lessons “of being small of giving more than you take of working with natural law sticking together all the ways that they live i just feel are really poignant teachings for us right now”  it’s the end of march and observing the new social distancing protocol we’re speaking over zoom – kimmerer from her home office outside syracuse new york me from shuttered south williamsburg in brooklyn where the constant wail of sirens are a sobering reminder of the pandemic the occasion is the uk publication of her second book the remarkable wise and potentially paradigmshifting braiding sweetgrass indigenous wisdom scientific knowledge and the teachings of plants which has become a surprise wordofmouth sensation selling nearly 400000 copies across north america and nearly 500000 worldwide in january the book landed on the new york times bestseller list seven years after its original release from the independent press milkweed editions – no small feat  a mother of two daughters and a grandmother kimmerer’s voice is mellifluous over the video call animated with warmth and wonderment her delivery is measured lyrical and when necessary and perhaps it’s always necessary impassioned and forceful she laughs frequently and easily today she has her long greyishbrown hair pulled loosely back and spilling out on to her shoulders and she wears circular woven patterned earrings behind her on the wooden bookshelves are birch bark baskets and sewn boxes mukluks and books by the environmentalist winona laduke and leslie marmon silko a writer of the native american renaissance  “sitting at a computer is not my favourite thing” admits the 66yearold native of upstate new york our original prepandemic plan had been meeting at the clark reservation state park a spectacular mossy woodland near her home but here we are staying 250 miles apart a distinguished professor in environmental biology at the state university of new york she has shifted her courses online it’s going well all things considered still not every lesson translates to the digital classroom for one such class on the ecology of moss she sent her students out to locate the ancient interconnected plants even if it was in an urban park or a cemetery to collect the samples one student used the glass from a picture frame like the mosses we too are adapting  facebook twitter pinterest moss in the forest around the bennachie hills near inverurie photograph bloomberggetty images  “most people don’t really see plants or understand plants or what they give us” kimmerer explains “so my act of reciprocity is having been shown plants as gifts as intelligences other than our own as these amazing creative beings – good lord they can photosynthesise that still blows my mind – i want to help them become visible to people people can’t understand the world as a gift unless someone shows them how it’s a gift”  in her debut collection of essays gathering moss she blended with deep attentiveness and musicality science and personal insights to tell the overlooked story of the planet’s oldest plants for braiding sweetgrass she broadened her scope with an array of object lessons braced by indigenous wisdom and culture from cedars we can learn generosity because of all they provide from canoes to capes from the creation story which tells of sky woman falling from the sky we can learn about mutual aid sweetgrass teaches the value of sustainable harvesting reciprocal care and ceremony the windigo mindset on the other hand is a warning against being “consumed by consumption” a windigo is a legendary monster from anishinaabe lore an “ojibwe boogeyman” ideas of recovery and restoration are consistent themes from the global to the personal  i think about grief as a measure of our love that grief compels us to do something to love more  in one standout section kimmerer an enrolled member of the citizen potawatomi nation tells the story of recovering for herself the enduring potawatomi language of her people one internet class at a time it’s meaningful too because her grandfather asa wall had been sent to the carlisle indian industrial school notorious for literally washing the nonenglish out of its young pupils’ mouths the resulting book is a coherent and compelling call for what she describes as “restorative reciprocity” an appreciation of gifts and the responsibilities that come with them and how gratitude can be medicine for our sick capitalistic world  in the years leading up to gathering moss kimmerer taught at universities raised her two daughters larkin and linden and published articles in peerreviewed journals a sample title from this period “environmental determinants of spatial pattern in the vegetation of abandoned leadzinc mines” writing of the type that she publishes now was something she “was doing quietly” away from academia but she chafed at having to produce these “boring” papers written in the “most objective” scientific language that despite its precision misses the point what she really wanted was to tell stories old and new to practice “writing as an act of reciprocity with the living land” through soulful accessible books informed by both western science and indigenous teachings alike she seeks most essentially to “encourage people to pay attention to plants” and she has now found those people to a remarkable extent  “i’ve never seen anything remotely like it” says daniel slager publisher and ceo of the nonprofit milkweed editions he describes the sales of braiding sweetgrass as “singular” “staggering” and “profoundly gratifying” since the book first arrived as an unsolicited manuscript in 2010 it has undergone 18 printings and appears or will soon in nine languages across europe asia and the middle east pulitzer prizewinning author richard powers is a fan declaring to the new york times “i think of her every time i go out into the world for a walk” robert macfarlane told me he finds her work “grounding calming and quietly revolutionary”  richard powers ‘it was like a religious conversion i realised the natural world isn’t ours’ read more  indeed braiding sweetrgrass has engaged readers from many backgrounds “i think when indigenous people either read or listen to this book what resonates with them is the life experience of an indigenous person it is part of the story of american colonisation” said rosalyn lapier an ethnobotanist and enrolled member of the blackfeet tribe of montana and métis who coauthored with kimmerer a declaration of support from indigenous scientists for 2017’s march for science “part of it is how do you revitalise your life how do you relearn your language how do you recreate a new relationship with the natural world when it’s not the same as the natural world your tribal community has a longstanding relationship with it’s a common shared story”  other lessons from the book have resonated too jessica goldschmidt a 31yearold writer living in los angeles describes how it helped her during her first week of quarantine “i was feeling very lonely and i was repotting some plants” and realised how important it was because “the book was helping me to think of them as people it’s something i do everyday because i’m just like ‘i don’t know when i’m going to touch a person again’”  “what’s being revealed to me from readers is a really deep longing for connection with nature” kimmerer says referencing edward o wilson’s notion of biophilia our innate love for living things “it’s as if people remember in some kind of early ancestral place within them they’re remembering what it might be like to live somewhere you felt companionship with the living world not estrangement though the flip side to loving the world so much” she points out citing the influential conservationist aldo leopold is that to have an ecological education is to “live alone in a world of wounds”  “we tend to shy away from that grief” she explains “but i think that that’s the role of art to help us into grief and through grief for each other for our values for the living world you know i think about grief as a measure of our love that grief compels us to do something to love more” compelling us to love nature more is central to her longterm project and it’s also the subject of her next book though “it’s definitely a work in progress” “the way i’m framing it to myself is when somebody closes that book the rights of nature make perfect sense to them” she says “i’m really trying to convey plants as persons”  the vulnerability were experiencing in the pandemic is the vulnerability that songbirds feel every day of their lives  key to this is restoring what kimmerer calls the “grammar of animacy” this means viewing nature not as a resource but like an elder “relative” – to recognise kinship with plants mountains and lakes the idea rooted in indigenous language and philosophy where a natural being isn’t regarded as “it” but as kin holds affinities with the emerging rightsofnature movement which seeks legal personhood as a means of conservation kimmerer understands her work to be the “long game” of creating the “cultural underpinnings”  “laws are a reflection of social movements” she says “laws are a reflection of our values so our work has to be to not necessarily use the existing laws but to promote a growth in values of justice that’s where i really see storytelling and art playing that role to help move consciousness in a way that these legal structures of rights of nature makes perfect sense i dream of a day where people say ‘well duh of course of course those trees have standing’”  our conversation turns once more to topics pandemicrelated kimmerer says that the coronavirus has reminded us that we’re “biological beings subject to the laws of nature that alone can be a shaking” she says motioning with her fist “but i wonder can we at some point turn our attention away to say the vulnerability we are experiencing right now is the vulnerability that songbirds feel every single day of their lives could this extend our sense of ecological compassion to the rest of our morethanhuman relatives”  kimmerer often thinks about how best to use her time and energy during this troubled era though she views demands for unlimited economic growth and resource exploitation as “all this foolishness” she recognises that “i don’t have the power to dismantle monsanto but what i do have is the capacity to change how i live on a daily basis and how i think about the world i just have to have faith that when we change how we think we suddenly change how we act and how those around us act and that’s how the world changes it’s by changing hearts and changing minds and it’s contagious i became an environmental scientist and a writer because of what i witnessed growing up within a world of gratitude and gifts”  “a contagion of gratitude” she marvels speaking the words slowly “i’m just trying to think about what that would be like acting out of gratitude as a pandemic i can see it”    • braiding sweetgrass by robin wall kimmerer is published by penguin httpsguardianbookshopcombraidingsweetgrass9780141991955html']\n",

could trust the city to do right by them either villereal 40 for one was not getting a shower any time soon  “i don’t live here” she shrugged at the safe sleeping village which is guarded by staff

host to the super bowl and in the months leading up to the festivities more and more homeless people found themselves getting pushed by authorities out of the city’s main stretches shelters – oftentimes tents – would end up confiscated along with everything inside them  facebook twitter pinterest san francisco’s first temporary sanctioned tent encampment for homeless people photograph justin sullivangetty images  even after a court ruling held that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment to enforce criminal laws against homeless people living on the street if a city did not offer enough shelters the sweeps and tent confiscations persisted the number of homeless individuals who lost everything they had because of the city’s stance on tents was enough that housing advocate leslie dreyer started the stolen belonging project “the city has focused on getting rid of visible homelessness for many years and i don’t think the general public really understood what it meant to throw a tent away” dreyer said  homeless individuals without a shelter were exempt when the shelterinplace order came down on 17 march but that didn’t protect them from infection or from possibly spreading the virus desperate homeless outreach activists began purchasing and handing out tents despite guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention to not clear encampments if there were no individual housing units available sweeps still continued  “from the moment we gave out the first tent we were asking where they safely could be and the city would only tell us where they couldn’t be not where they could be” said local activist christin evans  “they can’t be in the park they can’t be in business corridors they can’t be near residences” said kelley cutler the human

and the barriers were up” said encampment resident mick conway 49 “one day we woke up and the fences were up the next day they put the green fabric over the fence up and then one day they locked the doors they locked the gates and no one was allowed in or out”  those that ended up inside the fence had the option to sign an agreement with the city stating that they would follow encampment rules

respite encampment residents can sleep until noon without worrying about a neighbor calling in their presence as a nuisance conway said he likes “being able to set up your tent and stay where you want instead of being harassed by the police and pushed off somewhere else” the green fabric gives the camp a semblance of privacy and the urban alchemy staff stand watch at the doors and let in only residents and service workers  but the camp is also a caged spectacle pedestrians gawked at the fence discussing it loudly as they passed a man walking a chocolate labrador retriever stopped to peek

intentions “showcasing the horrors of poverty and hopelessness during the pandemic” she asked for artists to donate artwork to the camp musicians to perform for the residents and art therapists and teachers to facilitate “healing activities”  but this wouldn’t solve the issue that across the street from the sanctioned encampment at least 10 more tents crowd the sidewalk the residents in that

a hotel room  the city is planning on opening more sanctioned encampments but homeless outreach advocates and service workers are frustrated they had offered the solution of sanctioned encampments weeks ago when the city made clear that it would not house all unhoused individuals in hotel rooms  but it wasn’t until 10 weeks into the stayathome order that the city listened it wasn’t until thousands of the homeless population suffered in the streets with nowhere else to go it wasn’t until individuals like jasmine villereal had gone more than a month without a proper shower  villereal

“protecting public health is a priority and it’s vital to base decisions about travel on the best health and scientific advice no one should be in any doubt however that a 14day quarantine period for all travellers returning to the uk will unavoidably put many people off travelling abroad or visiting the uk and will therefore have a hugely damaging impact on the uk inbound and outbound tourism industries – which support hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country and have already been severely affected by the pandemic  “it’s therefore critical that the government regularly reviews this policy – including assessing its effectiveness and how it works with other control measures we’d also continue to urge the government to keep any measures proportionate targeted and limited only to what is necessary and to seek a coordinated approach with destinations in the eu and beyond”  the stringent new quarantine system will be reviewed every three weeks the government confirmed there will be exemptions for freight drivers doctors and scientists working on the pandemic and fruit pickers who will be expected to confine themselves to the farms where they work visitors from ireland will also be exempt  stephen phipson chief executive of make uk said “industry will be disappointed with this measure which is isolationist and will prevent many essential daily crossborder journeys to provide service and maintenance additionally air freight on passenger aircraft provides a significant proportion of uk export and supply chain capacity all of which is vital to operations as companies begin to get up and running”  adam tyndall programme director of the business lobbying group london first said “deciding to quarantine all passengers arriving into the uk is an indiscriminate response to an increasingly nuanced situation two weeks in isolation will put off most travellers all of whom would have contributed to the uk’s economic recovery  “the uk is a world leader in aviation and should be forging international agreements between lowrisk countries”  kate nicholls chief executive of uk hospitality said “the imposition of a quarantine period will inevitably damage international

the system comes into force on the british side” the french interior ministry said in a statement  facebook twitter pinterest priti patel announced details of the new quarantine measures on friday

to provide one will result in a £100 fine  new arrivals will also be encouraged to download the contact tracing app once it is available  the regime will be in place across the uk though the devolved administrations are expected to publish details of how they will implement it  the move rekindled the debate about why ministers did not restrict travel from areas affected by coronavirus much earlier in the outbreak  papers published by the sage group of scientific experts on friday showed that its modelling group spimo suggested on 3 february that restricting travel from badly hit areas including china could delay the onset of the disease in the uk by up to a fortnight  “based on current information on doubling times from china the average delay expected to result from a 90 reduction of travel from china may be up to two weeks” the experts said at the time  they cautioned that preventing direct arrivals from china alone would have had a smaller impact because of the risk of infected people coming via third countries  the shadow foreign secretary lisa nandy said the measures were “long overdue”  but she said they were not a longterm solution “if you’re asking people voluntarily to selfisolate for two weeks when they don’t have any symptoms and there’s pressure to go to work or they lose their jobs – it’s hard for people to know what to do”  she suggested that once the government’s track and trace system is in place the restrictions could potentially be loosened “if they have got a worldbeating test track and trace system up and running they can test people when they get off and then at that stage you could see a scenario at which point quarantine measures become redundant” she said  government messaging over the quarantine had been frustrating nandy said with seven occasions in which announcements relating to the policy had been made by a minister or briefed to newspapers and then dropped or rowed back from within the last month  she said the fact that the government had applied quarantine measures to only a handful of flights earlier in the crisis was “completely incoherent and inconsistent”']\n",

over a month ago health experts were saying japan risked becoming one of the world’s coronavirus “disaster zones”  its government was already facing criticism over its decision to quarantine passengers and crew aboard the diamond princess cruise liner and had been accused of underplaying the covid19 threat while it clung to the increasingly faint hope of hosting the olympics this summer  japan was testing too few people critics said opting instead to focus on clusters of cases rather than overburden its healthcare system with patients displaying no or only mild symptoms who by law had to be admitted to hospital one of the world’s richest countries they said was bungling its response  but today japan can make a strong case for being another coronavirus success story albeit one that has failed to resonate globally in the same way as those in south korea hong kong and taiwan  so far japan – a country of 126 million people with one of the biggest elderly populations in the world – has confirmed 16433 infections and 784 deaths out of a global death toll of more than 300000 people  in tokyo where almost 14 million people live new cases have remained below 40 for more than a fortnight with just five cases reported on two consecutive days this week that compares with a peak of 206 new cases reported on 17 april on friday the public broadcaster nhk reported just three new cases in the capital in the previous 24 hours  achieving such low figures barely seemed possible in early april when just as the number of cases began to rise sharply in tokyo and other major cities neighbouring south korea – with its widely praised regime of testing tracing and treating – was flattening the curve  on 7 april the prime minister shinzo abe belatedly declared a state of emergency in the capital and other affected areas that was later expanded to include all 47 of the country’s prefectures  but japan’s version of “lockdown” – requests to avoid unnecessary outings work from home and observe social distancing – came across as a timid response to a situation that risked spiraling out of control the dispatch of two reusable masks to every household was met with derision as people posted photographs on social media of the small and in some cases dirty “abenomasks” – a play on the leader’s economic policy dubbed “abenomics”  facebook twitter pinterest masks and hand

consultancy “i think he has struggled to stay ahead of events since the beginning has not communicated effectively and has been poorly served by his lieutenants”  japan has skirted a coronavirus surge with room to spare after new cases slowed markedly when abe who does not have the legal powers to declare a europeanstyle lockdown called on people to beat the virus by avoiding the “three cs” confined and crowded spaces and close human contact  the abe administration has gained few political dividends for its response instead most plaudits have gone to the quiet determination shown by the public armed with viruschallenging habits formed long before the pandemic  masks are a common sight during the winter flu season and in spring among people with hay fever the custom of bowing rather than shaking hands or hugging generally high standards of personal hygiene and the removal of shoes when entering homes have all been held up as possible explanations for japan’s low infection rate  facebook twitter pinterest tokyo’s governor yuriko koike holds a press conference on friday 22 may photograph rodrigo reyes marinzuma wirerexshutterstock  experts have pointed to universal healthcare low obesity rates and expertise in treating pneumonia more fanciful theories have gained traction – the consumption of foods such as natto that boost the immune system and according to an unscientific experiment conducted by a tv network the relatively low number of airborne droplets generated by spoken japanese  “i don’t think the falling number of infections is due to government policies” said ryuji koike the assistant director of tokyo medical and dental university hospital “i think it looks like japan is doing well thanks to things that can’t be measured like daily habits and ‘japanese behaviour’”  personal habits and cultural traits however tell only part of the story while japan hesitated before imposing restrictions on overseas visitors it was quick to recognise the dangers of

without spectators for the first time in the sport’s history abe was criticised for calling for “unnecessary” school closures in early march yet many other countries then did the same  rob fahey a research associate at the waseda institute of political economy in tokyo believes declaring japan’s ability to contain the outbreak a “mystery” ignores the role of individual and collective action  “acknowledging this however requires looking beyond the usual set of policy actors and recognising that japan’s response overall can still have been exemplary even if the performance of its central government left much to be desired” fahey wrote in the tokyo review this week  japan’s incremental exit from the state of emergency continues last week abe ended the measure in 39 prefectures adding another three this week tokyo and four other prefectures could join them as early as monday according to media reports  but experts are warning against complacency given that the low rates of testing may be distorting the extent of infections – a hazard recognised by the government’s own expert shigeru omi who admitted that nobody knows whether the true number of coronavirus cases “could be 10 times 12 times or 20 times more than reported”  as tokyo’s backstreet bars and restaurants started filling up again this week – with some staying open beyond the 8pm closing time requested by the

prodemocracy figures for illegal assembly the new legislation could make such activists and campaigners still more vulnerable  the spectre of the tiananmen square crackdown in 1989 has hung over the last year of unrest in hong kong particularly as violence escalated there were mounting concerns among demonstrators that police or military personnel might be sent over from the mainland to clear the streets – fears that are now likely to deepen analysts said  “the draft includes specifically a provision for mainland security forces to be deployed to hong kong if necessary which suggests that they have already thought about this and are prepared to put it into the law” said prof steve tsang the director of the soas china institute in london  “so they are expecting the protests to come and they are prepared to go and crush them and i regrettably think they will crush them”  hong kong’s chief executive carrie lam explicitly linked provisions of the new law to the “disturbances” of the protest

worrying about over the past year”  “the emergence of various incidents involving explosives and firearms has posed the risk of terrorism seriously jeopardising public safety” the statement said

even clearer message of intent to break the movement intimidation alone is unlikely to keep hong kong’s people off the streets some will be hoping to garner international support which they see as the only slim hope of pushing back against beijing  pompeo’s statement attacking china’s “disastrous” move was part of a strong chorus of international condemnation in a joint statement with the australian and canadian foreign ministers the uk’s foreign secretary dominic raab said he was “deeply concerned” about the proposed new law and he emphasised that the “legally binding” 1984 agreement – which promised hong kong 50 years of autonomy – remained in force  “making such a law on hong kong’s behalf without the direct participation of its people legislature or judiciary would clearly

deal which aims to create millions of jobs in renewable energy and help the economy recover from the coronavirus lockdown  lee’s transformation highlights how much progress the global wave of youth climate activism has made in a remarkably short space of time it also raises hopes that south korea – a country long considered one of the world’s worst climate villains – will set a global example by accelerating the shift away from fossil fuels  lee was invited to stand as a candidate for the president moon jaein’s democracy party in last month’s legislative elections she proposed a green new

decarbonise korean society this is my personal mission that is why i went into politics”  winning her seat in a landslide she is now part of a ruling coalition with a huge majority to push through any measures it chooses  the government’s priority is to boost the economy after the covid19 crisis south korea has won praise around the world for its handling of the health pandemic but its powerful industrial conglomerates have taken a big hit from the downturn in global trade  many business leaders and veteran ministers want recovery to focus purely on digital technology but civil society and lawmakers like lee have persuaded the president that it is possible to create jobs and raise climate ambitions  “it’s clear the green new deal is the way for us to go” moon announced this week “it’s necessary to lay out a grand plan for the green new deal to harmonise with the establishment of digital infrastructure”  for the president the priority is job creation and demonstrating to the world that south korea is a responsible member of the international community  recent history gives cause for scepticism this hightech nation has a lowgrade energy supply after the 200809 financial crisis the government promised a “green growth” strategy but the plans for more river protection and bike lanes were an excuse for construction companies to pour more concrete than ever  in the years since coal use and carbon emissions have surged the country is calculated to have 106bn of fossil fuel assets incompatible with the paris climate agreement – more than any other nation in 2016 activists described south korea as the world’s biggest carbon villain  analysts say this time is different because the president has already set a goal of raising the share of electricity coming from renewables

efforts if it halted support for coal plants in southeast asia it is one of only three nations – along with china and japan – that still provide loans for such projects which are blackballed by most nations and a growing number of international financial institutions  “if we stop this funding it will show the transition in our country and across the global community” lee said “we need to give up

that just 10 of the 300 legislators are seriously committed to climate issues “it is definitely still not mainstream” she said “but the green new deal is now at the centre of political discussion for the first time we need to see whether this means a sudden revolutionary change or the start of something incremental  “i am not going to be over optimistic about securing a tremendous budget with huge

happening  “oh this is beneath you now” i was told  i took the call in my stride but it was a terrible way to find out what truly perplexed me was that the previous year anna had loved my interviews

official name for britain’s volunteer police – spread across frontline policing taking on vital duties to an extent that would surprise most members of the public volunteer police are not to be confused with community support officers the latter are employed police assistants who unlike volunteers aren’t fully sworn constables and can’t arrest people special constables haven’t been this needed for decades last year the number of fulltime officers dropped by 12 in england and wales to 128149 meanwhile knife crime in england and wales rose by 7 last year to the highest levels since records began in 2011  the commitment made last summer by the prime minister boris johnson to begin replacing the 20000 regular officers lost in britain over the past decade is likely to have a limited longterm impact on the need for volunteers fulltime police take time to train while britain’s population has grown by 4 million since 2010 and officers’ work has increased “phenomenally” according to chief officer john conway of the metropolitan police’s volunteer service the country’s largest “i can’t see a reduction in policing demand any time soon” he says citing rises in violent

calling the initiation “a baptism of fire” after 23 days of training specials must commit to a minimum of 16 hours a month but many give significantly more time volunteering on nights weekends and

much further could their duties extend    for much of modern history specials were treated as a “hobbybobby joke” according to iain britton a senior criminal justice researcher at the university of northampton aside from helping out during major disturbances many specials spent significant time doing humdrum tasks such as guiding traffic and patrolling local fetes or open days little more than a decade ago they were routinely seen by fulltime officers as liabilities and overtime stealers who lacked experience when i meet special inspector david lane at the metropolitan police marine
