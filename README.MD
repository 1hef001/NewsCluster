# News Cluster

##### This repository is a clusterer using news headlines

The clustering used here is K-Means clustering and MDS clustering


#### [scraper.py](https://github.com/1hef001/NewsCluster/blob/master/news-cluster/scraper.py) scrapes google news by default but can be set to scrape any online news vendor

Run it after uncommenting the driver code to test.

```
    python scraper.py
```

#### [main.py](https://github.com/1hef001/NewsCluster/blob/master/news-cluster/main.py) is the driver code for the whole project. Run this and it'll take control.

```
    python main.py
```
