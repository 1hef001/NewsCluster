2,boost ties with taiwan china can’t dictate terms for everyone in asia,china has taken umbrage at two bjp mps meenakshi lekhi and rahul kaswan virtually participating in the recent swearingin ceremony of taiwan’s president tsai ingwen both mps were among 92 dignitaries that included us secretary of state mike pompeo who virtually attended the ceremony but china has registered a protest against india’s participation on the ground that india officially adheres to the ‘one china’ principle which sees taiwan as part of china  it’s true that india does indeed adhere to the ‘one china’ principle but that shouldn’t stop us from expanding appropriate relations with taiwan which enjoys de facto sovereignty after all the us too subscribes to a ‘one china’ policy but that hasn’t stopped washington from having significant cooperation — including defence sales — with taipei besides when china itself doesn’t adhere to ‘one india’ and lays claims to arunachal pradesh why should new delhi bend over backwards to please beijing nor does beijing consult new delhi when it carries out activities in pakistanoccupiedkashmir which india claims so why should new delhi seek permission for pursuing reasonable relations with taiwan  meanwhile taiwan has been an excellent example of containing the ongoing covid19 pandemic and wants to share its medical experience with the world it has even donated face masks for frontline medical workers in india yet beijing has been unjustly blocking taipei’s participation at the who add to this the ongoing border tensions between indian and chinese troops in eastern ladakh against this backdrop india should be open to boosting ties with taiwan in an appropriate form china can’t set the rules of engagement for everyone in asia beijing’s assertiveness and unreasonable demands must be countered  read also  indiachina standoff politicaldiplomatic talks seen as only way out
3,back with a bang nanny state what is being achieved with so many restrictions on opening up the economy,in moments of crisis it is useful to sometimes visit the wisdom of the past some 2300 years ago chanakya wrote this insightful nugget strangely relevant to our current dilemma “the root of wealth is economic activity and lack of it brings material distress in the absence of fruitful activity both current prosperity and future growth are in danger of destruction in the interests of the prosperity of the country a king should be diligent in foreseeing the possibility of calamities try and overcome those which happen remove all obstructions to economic activity and prevent loss of revenue to the state a king with a depleted treasury eats into the very vitality of the citizens and the country”  obviously today the king stands for the government the message is clear the government must resolutely fight the pandemic but also allow the economy which has moved from the icu to the ventilator to revive if we persist with the fiction of a new lockdown to tackle the virus we may end up falling flat between all stools neither the virus will be contained nor will the economy efficiently recover  today lakhs of urban poor are on trains and highways in close physical proximity huge crowds on rail heads and bus stations mock the very purpose of a lockdown some restrictions have been lifted offices are functional shops have opened construction activity has resumed factories are free to run taxis and autos are on the roads frankly if we are honest the lockdown as originally conceived is dead  if this is so what is being achieved by so many restrictions on the opening up of the economy in delhi shops can open only on odd and even days this is pure bureaucratic obstructionism as though the virus is active only on an odd even basis metros hotels restaurants malls and cinema halls cannot open normal rail and bus services have not been resumed construction activities can restart only if workers are available on site or can be “transported” as the delhi government guideline states “to the site from within the nct of delhi”  in addition there is a new tyranny of the micro domestic airlines have tentatively opened but their operation is subject to what state governments decree leading to rampant confusion and uncertainty district authorities have been empowered to identify red orange green containment and buffer zones a local bureaucrat can thus override at will panindian economic activity of production supply lines vendors retailers labour and transport  state governments can arbitrarily shut borders as up and haryana have currently done this means that a person from gurgaon or noida can come to delhi to work but cannot go back mumbai says 33 staff can go to office delhi allows 100 such variations are not an example of ‘cooperative federalism’ they are a bureaucratic nightmare which can snarl any meaningful attempt to kickstart the economy  lower down the chain rwas have become insensitive autocracies institutionalising a siege mentality forgetting that a parttime worker who is stopped from entering a barricaded housing complex is also a link – however small – in boosting economic demand on which a middle class aspirant may ultimately get a job as happens in any ‘permit raj’ scenario the final arbiter to interpret opaque multiple and overlapping rules is the police the local sho has become the new potentate  the lockdown is fast becoming a chakravyuh from which we need a national vision to exit the central government must issue overarching clearcut and detailed national guidelines and allow state governments powers to seal containment zones only if absolutely essential on the basis of verifiable testing with the elderly and those with comorbidities continuing to selfisolate the rest of the economy must open  the assumption must be that with enhanced awareness about physical distancing masks and hygiene both employers and employees – in their own selfinterest and on the basis of sops – will do their best to prevent the spread of the disease the paranoia about the virus must subside and government should disabuse itself of the notion that citizens are children for whom it can be a perennial nanny  legally the central government is mandated by the disaster management act 2005 under which the lockdown was announced to draw up a national disaster and management plan such a plan should be as the act states “for the effective management of disasters and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto” the battering the economy has received is certainly ‘connected’ to the pandemic and ‘incidental thereto’  the pm chairs the national disaster management authority ndma set up by the act which has extensive and overriding powers and can issue directions to any authority anywhere in india he must now assume the responsibility of a panindian strategy to exit the lockdown which while sensitive to state government views does not pass the buck to them under the convenient guise of ‘cooperative federalism’  chanakya’s advice was prophetic if we heed it we will indeed be able to cull out opportunity from crisis but nothing is worse for effective policy making than to remain hesitant unsure and undecided about where you want to go
4,turbulent start air travel judders to take off ease the flight path for airlines and flyers,another step towards reopening the economy was made yesterday with the resumption of commercial flight operations however both airlines and flyers have to tide over significant barriers along the way flights were cancelled leaving passengers in the lurch but the biggest difficulty is proving to be the doubts and ambivalence harboured by state governments in allowing inbound flights some of india’s busiest airports like mumbai chennai hyderabad and kolkata are capping the number of flights widely differing quarantine protocols of various state governments are also proving to be a dampener for air travel  fear of imported covid cases is genuine but walling off completely is not an option if the economy is to restart states can’t be complaining about revenues tanking during the lockdown and then contradicting that by worrying themselves into a tizzy about the risks of reopening the economy transport and the unhindered movement of people commodities and services are the lifeline of the economy a new normal will not be possible without reasonable compromises in these areas  most of the bigger economies save for india and saudi arabia had only partial restrictions on air travel indian airline companies weakened by successive lockdowns can do with more governmental support and predictable policies the hollowing out of the aviation sector isn’t in the interest of the centre or states with its knockon effects on tourism hospitality and ancillary services in precovid times it wasn’t unusual to see states wooing more airlines to service airports in their territories offering incentives like fuel tax reduction centre too needs to rethink its price caps with planes flying half empty  the interest of flyers is equally important states must arrive at a uniform quarantine protocol and make allowances for business travellers spending just a day or two at their port of call concerns about modality of institutional home quarantine must be resolved soon flyers must also get refunds for cancelled flights covid cases have shot up from 500odd at the lockdown’s start to over 13 lakh now pointing to significant community transmission air travel can no longer be termed a singular risk factor with other sectors also opening up two months should have been adequate to add capacity in the system to test trace isolate and treat fear psychosis stemming from unpreparedness is no longer an excuse for administrators
5,a different eid sombre celebrations but the message of the festival has been reinforced,this year’s eidulfitr marking the end of the holy month of ramzan has indeed been very different being observed in the midst of the covid19 pandemic the usual community prayers coming together of families and friends and the hustlebustle of eid markets have been missing imams and community leaders the world over have asked the faithful to abide by covid guidelines and restrictions throughout ramzan and eid  eid of course is all about congregation and expressions of fraternity in that sense it is comparable to the hindu festival of holi which is about contact and intimacy however given the covid pandemic that’s raging such celebrations necessarily have to be subdued and compliance hasn’t been a problem this eid then there were heartening examples of communal amity a church in germany opened its doors to muslim worshippers for friday namaz as mosques couldn’t accommodate all devotees due to social distancing rules here in india the vaishno devi shrine provided sehri and iftari to over 500 muslims under quarantine while sikh volunteers conducted a massive sanitisation drive at delhi’s jama masjid such examples reinforce the true message of ramzan and eid which is compassion  such compassion is required more than ever at this moment given the massive economic crisis that has been sparked by the covid pandemic and subsequent lockdowns that has led to an unprecedented number of job losses – urban and rural unemployment are estimated to be at 227 and 25 currently both unprecedented numbers – and a massive exodus of migrant urban workers due to lack of social security this sombre eid should sharpen our focus on some of the things that are really important – selfdiscipline helping those less privileged boosting communal harmony and striving to be better human beings
6,for india to emerge from the corona crisis there is need for greater dialogue in a federal setup,by sanjay kumar and chandrachur singh  evidence suggests that the 2014 and 2019 general elections witnessed a significant shift amongst obc voters mainly the lower obc and dalit voters in favour of bjp contributing to its massive victory during the two lok sabha elections while bjp received massive support amongst the upper castes its traditional supporters what made a huge difference was the shift amongst the obc and dalits towards bjp  in 2014 ls elections 31 obc voted for bjp which increased to 36 in 2019 in this shift amongst obc towards bjp urban lower and poor income class migrants have been instrumental as they seemed to be convinced by prime minister narendra modi’s developmental model for prospects of better livelihoods poor urban migrants a majority of whom belong to obc groups and continue to have roots in their respective villages have been instrumental in endorsing aspirational developmental appeals of bjp allowing it to override caste barriers by swinging rural obc votes in their favour  now when a large number of migrants have returned to their native villages and some are still struggling to be back their unhappiness with bjp is bound to have impact on both urban and rural politics this unhappiness might compel them to rethink if they would still like to vote for bjp this may open up opportunities for regional parties to reach out to these newly returned migrants to do all that they could to ease their sufferings and bring them back in their fold  since congress is still lying low – unlikely to revive before states like bihar this year and west bengal assam tamil nadu and kerala next year go to the polls – these migrants who have returned might shift their vote towards regional parties in these states if sizeable numbers of them decide to shift their vote away from bjp it would certainly dent bjp’s support base which by default would strengthen the political base of regional parties  regional parties may not be able to capture power in all these states say in bihar or assam but their sizeable presence in the state assemblies might compel the ruling party to build better ties and have more consultations with these regional parties this is why bjp under modi must walk that extra mile to resolve the looming migrant labour crisis  what a federal country like india needs is consultative thinking not only for its fight against corona epidemic but for any policy which has implications for its federating units most states supported modi’s extension of lockdown till may 3 not only because it was the need of the hour but also because of a healthy consultation which the pm had with all the chief ministers however as things wore on some states started erecting fences and digging trenches on borders that they share with other neighbouring states some others have been reluctant in accepting migrant labourers back in their fold  this is where the need of a consultative mechanism of decision making becomes imperative had the first lockdown been made in adequate consultations with cms it would have surely allowed greater ease in foreseeing and possibly addressing the issues of the poor urban migrant labourers it is also certain that no cm would have objected to that decision  unfortunately however the first lockdown came as a surprise to many states a few of whom had already been sulking for not being kept in the loop on critically important federal issues – both political and financial india at present is fortunate in having an immensely strong and popular leader as its pm but the need of the hour is to galvanise the political discourse of india for greater autonomy for states and local bodies  activating federal bodies like the inter state council to establish a dedicated covid19 monitoring and coordination mechanism could be a plausible way out of the current chaos as india tries to emerge from its lockdown most importantly however a new discourse must be started now when the nation is facing an unprecedented economic crisis  sanjay kumar is a professor at centre for the study of developing societies chandrachur singh teaches political science at hindu college
7,together 247 and now our love needs a break from this incessant companionship,we were home enjoying the 52nd consecutive day of covid19 togetherness when i said this is funny wife says to husband i am angry with you husband reflects for a moment and says again or still  my laughter is met with stony silence that silence wives give when they want to express deep disappointment at what they won in the marital lucky dip it is a kind of a lip curling eye rolling sneer set to an audio of deep and heartfelt sighs of resignation well married men know what i mean  to break the silence i say look at this article so many bollywood stars have postponed their weddings and their engagements because of covid19 thank goodness there was no such thing 40 years ago when we got married ha ha we’d still be waiting there is no corresponding peal of laughter instead she gets this wistful look on her face like hmmm not a bad idea could have done with a postponement perhaps mulled it over had a rethink a second shot with the bat no rush considering all the people i could have married  all over the world husbands and wives pitted with each other dredging for virtue in this forced companionship with no coffee break in each other’s way 247 in the old days three months back couples said bye after brekka went to work came back in the evening grumbled about the boss yelled at the kids and caught up on gossip now they are in each other’s hair  a couple of days back she said we have been glued together see what i mean for nearly two months and they say 85 of couples are so disconnected they won’t even know their wife’s favourite flower i thought for a long moment and then said yours is selfraising right  oh she still loves me it is just that we have had a bit much of this togetherness and it is wearing us down we are together in the morning we are together for lunch in the afternoon into the evening onto dinner every day we find that much more about each other and what we need now is a break from this incessant companionship and we truly don’t want to find anything more  what happens is that with all this intimacy sloshing about the scales fall off that loving endearing giggle of hers from way back when is now like chalk on a blackboard and i overheard her tell a friend on zoom that i was a slob and told boring jokes and had never shown any ambition yesterday she sent me a whatsapp message can you promise me a little social distancing please we cannot be together unless we are apart now that hurt
8,the south india model what north india could learn about governance and citizenship,in coronavirus times what kerala thinks today india should think tomorrow kerala has over 800 covid cases yet so far only 4 have died mortality in other states is far higher for example gujarat with one of the highest mortality rates in india is reporting over 800 deaths with over 13000 cases kerala was once derided for its failure to create jobs for the “killing fields” of kannur uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath mocked kerala’s healthcare record and prime minister narendra modi described infant mortality among kerala adivasis as worse than somalia but today the internationally acclaimed kerala model has delivered better than the trumpeted gujarat model  it’s not just kerala south india as a whole is managing the pandemic more deftly than the north in tamil nadu cases have risen sharply yet mortality is relatively under control in andhra pradesh under 100 have lost lives and karnataka – another strong covid fighter – is reporting under 50 fatalities with over 2000 cases in overall healthcare performance a 2019 world bank niti aayog report shows kerala and tn rank highest while up rajasthan and bihar are at the bottom  that the south india model of governance has always delivered better healthcare and education is well known but what else does north india lack which puts it at a disadvantage south india is blessed with two features the north could well emulate one stable political competition between parties and two an assertive citizenry  if a political party monopolises public office for too long it has little incentive to deliver welfare in north indian states a herd mentality among voters often results in massive mandates for one or the other party which then remains in office for decades lording it over voters like monarchs in the first five decades of independence congress governed uninterrupted across north india its suffocating dominance setting off a reaction of intense political fragmentation both monopoly and fragmentation acted as barriers to governance in the north  in other examples the three decade long stranglehold of the left in bengal and the 22yearlong unbroken stint of bjp in gujarat show how voter support can be taken for granted in this kind of political monopoly citizens become disconnected from state activity or from having a say in government policies  by sharp contrast in south india no one party enjoys a monopoly instead there is stable political competition in kerala the leftled ldf and congressled udf are given alternating spells in office by voters the left which was monopolistic in bengal had to compete in kerala resulting in a better governance performance in tn aiadmk and dmk took turns in 2004 andhra voters unexpectedly threw out high profile cm chandrababu naidu but he returned in 2014 karnataka too enjoys cyclical political changes congress was followed by janata then bjp political competition means there’s an incentive on the part of governments to deliver  south india is wellserved with another entity the assertive citizen peaceful political competition has opened up space for citizens’ participation and spurred civic activism on the ground empowered citizens are in a position to demand basic rights like healthcare and education in andhra and kerala volunteer groups of citizens are even pitching in to help governments with contact tracing so far in north india only aap government has taken a stab at creating citizenresponsive government  in gujarat the ahmedabad municipal commissioner was recently transferred reportedly for aggressive covid testing and pushing up gujarat’s numbers andhra and tn by contrast have encouraged aggressive testing governments which depend on citizens’ goodwill cannot afford to live in denial functioning local citizens’ bodies and community participation ensure that services are delivered in north india citizens are helplessly subjugated to the maibaap government and state power and unable to demand even the basics  during the 2018 kerala floods local communities worked to help victims in tn civil society groups repeatedly make their presence felt bengaluru and hyderabad are known for their diverse citizen activist groups the latter forming the backbone of the agitation for telangana statehood forceful citizens keep governments on their toes  the need to deliver also means that governance is relatively immune from religious hate and divisiveness politics in the south is just as cutthroat as the north yet politics doesn’t overwhelm the larger governance agenda in fact governance is relatively speaking insulated from polarising politics in karnataka political disputes between lingayats and vokkaligas have not been allowed to hijack the administration unlike the north in the south governance is relatively separate from caste polarisation this separation of governance from politics means the bureaucracy is less likely to get caught up in partisan politics  in the north the covid outbreak became tangled in antitablighi bigotry discriminatory incidents like attacks on muslim vegetable vendors were not seen in the south in the north because of all pervasive state power even citizens groups like rwas tend to function as vigilantes persecuting each other an example of this is the ghaziabad rwa which threatened to stop doctors from returning to their homes in bihar citizens must distribute relief supplies only through police stations showing that the government doesn’t trust people and wants to always control them  in parts of south india social revolution preceded the political revolution reformers like kerala’s narayana guru and tn’s periyar created selfaware citizens empowered enough to resist excessive state coercion citizens able to use the vote to change nonperforming governments in north india electorates remain swayed by emotive irrational appeals assembly elections in bihar are scheduled for october it remains to be seen if any party will make healthcare a core issue or whether it’ll be back to caste arithmetic and religious name calling
9,don’t succumb new delhi must show it can stand up to beijing’s wolf warrior tactics,beijing is bringing in a national security law in hong kong that effectively spells the end of the ‘one country two systems’ approach granting autonomy to the economic hub its move to integrate hong kong could lead to the us revoking the city’s trade privileges and possibly offering asylum to hong kong’s dual passport holders thereby stripping the city of its best and brightest that beijing still decided to go ahead despite the risks involved – besides unilaterally declaring new administrative districts to incorporate disputed islands in south china sea – indicates that it is willing to up the ante as a major revisionist power in the world system  alongside beijing is also stepping up the ante along the lac the confrontation began earlier this month in sikkim and eastern ladakh and has seen both sides send in additional troops to the forward areas the situation is particularly tense at galwan valley with an estimated 1200 chinese soldiers pitching 80100 tents and setting up bunkers much ahead of china’s claim lines in the region  indian diplomats have rightly seen a connection between chinese aggressiveness along the lac and the broader trend of “wolf warrior” diplomacy that beijing is currently showcasing it is willing to hit countries like australia with import bans for example when the latter legitimately broached the question of probing the covid pandemic’s origins since beijing permits few imports from india in any case pressure along the lac may be its instrument of choice in coercing india to back its international positions now facing flak from western countries and to accede to a china dominated order  thus beijing has been vehemently opposing taiwan’s participation at who – despite taiwan’s demonstrated success in containing covid – and wants new delhi to take its side it may also want new delhi to reverse its recent move closing the automatic route for chinese investments but new delhi must firmly stand up to chinese pressure this is especially so since beijing rarely gives any diplomatic quarter to new delhi on issues important to india such as kashmir or terror on the economic front too china rarely adheres to reciprocity and has done little to mitigate the huge bilateral trade deficit by giving indian investments or imports more access a china dominated asian order would be disastrous india should join cause with likeminded nations and entities including taiwan and push for a rules based multilateral order
10,city disrupted kolkata india’s third largest metro needs help to recover after amphan’s aftermath,kolkata’s struggle to get back on its feet after the devastation wrought by cyclone amphan requires the bengal administration to speed up the massive restoration effort that the unprecedented situation demands large parts of the city of nearly 15 crore people are without electricity and drinking water as fallen trees and water logging make movement and repair work difficult with communication lines also down in many areas because of power disruption several localised protests broke out forcing bengal chief minister mamata banerjee to plead for patience  five army columns – each having 35 personnel and 10 more ndrf teams to supplement the currently deployed 26 – have been dispatched to help in clearing roads and cutting trees but this force strength is inadequate given the scale of damage the state government mustn’t be chary of drafting more central support citizens in big cities are now habituated to amenities like power supply mobile connectivity piped water and green cover and don’t take kindly to disruption even if the reason is natural disaster unfortunately urban governance remains brittle and crumbles quickly when tested as in kolkata  there is also the devastation suffered in neighbouring south bengal districts like south and north 24 parganas where thatched huts have been blown away and houses submerged by rivers overflowing their embankments with bay of bengal cyclones increasing in both frequency and ferocity the state will have to replicate neighbouring odisha’s attempts to build cyclone resilient infrastructure the state government is fighting other battles too like the lockdown’s economic repercussions rising covid19 cases and movement of migrant workers apart from immense political contestation on all these issues given limited state capacity government and opposition must temporarily set aside political differences for the immediate term to focus on restoring essential services to people
11,‘rtpcr is fairly quick it’s now used with high reliability as a test to detect covid19’,tests to detect the presence of the novel coronavirus have been marred by false positive and false negative results parnali dhar chowdhury a research scientist in the field of infectious diseases in the department of epidemiology johns hopkins university unpacks the popular virus detection tests to chinmay chaudhuri  from the current global covid19 map what is your ‘outbreak assessment’ both in terms of spread and speed of the viral infection  on january 5 after who published first disease outbreak news on the new virus it took only 25 more days for who to declare covid19 as a public health emergency of international concern pheic coronavirus took 67 days from the beginning of its outbreak in china in late december to infect the first 100000 people worldwide naturally covid19 evolved as a rising infectious disease which involves fast spreading endangering the health of large numbers of people this is why there was a huge urgency to develop an online platform that provides latest and reliable news development as well as statistics and analysis on covid19 based on this map or what we can call it as ‘corona tracker’ we can see that the number of confirmed covid19 cases and number of covid19 deaths in corona tracker are very much dependent on the numbers that each country releases therefore it is still difficult to assess the accurate outbreak and we can only obtain an accurate prediction after the outbreak ends the outbreak spreads are largely influenced by each country’s policy and social responsibility as data transparency is crucial inside the government it is hard to predict accurately if we depend on scientific conclusion  on the basis of covid19’s growth trajectory currently which are the pandemic ‘explosion zones’  coronavirus has already exhibited exponential growth meaning that its impact could potentially double in a short stretch of time then double again in a similarly short stretch of time and so forth therefore the growth trajectory is key to understanding the eventual toll of the disease getting correct estimates of the growth rate of covid19 is crucial to forecast what happens next the contrast in the very different trajectories of the coronavirus pandemic in italy and south korea provides a clear example of how much outcomes can differ and how much this matters in light of this currently the leading three countries in terms of highest confirmed cases are the us russia and uk which can be considered as pandemic ‘explosion zones’ however this scenario may change very quickly based on a number of confirmed cases among other countries which have higher population density  have the us and the uk peaked if not what lies ahead in these two continents  well it’s still difficult to answer in short however looking at a rolling average over the past seven days new deaths in the us are showing signs that they may have reached a peak and there is a definite downward trend in hospital deaths in the uk  what is your assessment of the pandemic situation in india is the government on the right track in its fight against the pandemic  as of may 15 the ministry of health and family welfare have confirmed a total of 78003 cases 26235 recoveries including 1 migration and 2549 deaths in the country the infection rate of covid19 in india is reported to be 17 which is quite lower than in the worst affected developed countries to be in the right track to fight against the covid19 pandemic it’s very important to do as much as testing as possible in a fastpaced manner proper surveillance of high risk zones maintaining a transparent corona tracker program among all states building awareness program on social distancing and daily life challenges that people are facing during this covid19 crisis etc etc to name few if these actions are in place then fighting would be much easier and right track as an epidemiologist i am not in a position to comment more as it is not my expertise  we are using diagnostic tests to assess infections in patients is the test the best way to assess a patient what are its limitations  many diagnostic tests for covid19 are available so far with more gaining emergency approval every day these tests are largely based on four different techniques they are 1 reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction or rtpcr — the current standard test for covid19 2 loopmediated isothermal amplification lamp — a simple but less developed testing method 3 lateral flow — handheld singleuse assays providing results for an individual patient in as short as 15 minutes and 4 enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa — quick and technically simple assays that are easily read and offer relatively high throughput however there are mainly two types of tests that we carry out for covid19 one is to confirm if you currently have the virus pcr and one is to ask if you have made antibodies against the virus serology both kinds of tests help us make public health decisions about measures to contain the outbreak  there are a couple of limitations that we are facing antibody test results should not be used to diagnose someone with an active sarscov2 infection depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test the test may not find antibodies in someone with an active infection specificity doesn’t detect nontarget viruses and sensitivity true positive rate of antibody tests vary which is another limitation a test that detects the sarscov2 virus such as one that checks respiratory samples should be used to test for active infection however we do not know if the antibodies that result from sarscov2 infection will provide someone with immunity from a future infection if antibodies do provide immunity we don’t know what titer or amount of antibodies would be protective or the duration that protection would last  rtpcr test is supposed to be the most reliable compared to antibody tests but even this has thrown up different results in the primary and final tests on the same patient how do you explain this  pcr is fairly quick sensitive and a very common scientific technique that has been widely used in research and medicine for around 2030 years to detect genetic information rtpcr is now being used with high reliability as a test to detect covid19 virus with pcr testing we are looking for rna as evidence of an infectious agent as coronavirus is a single strand rna virus so if you run a pcr test on a vial filled with a virus the test will come back indicating the rna sequence of what is in the tube in the next step this rna sequence is being matched with the known sequence of coronavirus which then tells us whether the rna sequence present in the virus of the sample is matching with coronavirus or not so this rtpcr is completely a pure lab test example now the reality is different what happens in reality or when used in practice a swab taken from a patient hoping that if patients have the coronavirus infection that enough of the virus is picked up on the swab for the pcr test to be able to detect the virus as the swab needs to pick up enough of the virus to work this is one of the reasons the coronavirus the pcr test can have a higher falsenegative test rate — ie missing the virus even though someone has the infection so basically the test uses swabs from the nose and throat and has a high accuracy rate but it doesn’t pick up all infections and therefore sometimes results vary  what are the limitations of serology tests  serology testing reveals if you have been exposed to the virus and your body has developed antibodies there are two different types of antibodies immunoglobulin m igm and immunoglobulin g igg igm antibodies are present early in infection igg antibodies arise a few days later you will not have antibodies against sarscov2 if you have not been infected the limitation of this igg and igm serology tests are that it won’t detect active infection it typically takes 1 to 3 weeks after someone becomes infected with sarscov2 for their body to make antibodies some people may take longer to develop antibodies so by the time you are doing serology test you have been exposed to covid 19 virus at least 23 weeks earlier and you may have infected many innocent people unknowingly  our economy is struggling hard to stay afloat amid the nationwide lockdown but patience is running out as resources are fast bottoming out however reopening has its risks what is your assessment are the imminent dangers  as an infectious disease specialist my assessment would be insufficient as i don’t have any solid economics or social science background  do you think india has fought enough to be able to take the risk of restarting its economy what should be the idle way of doing so what are the dangers  who executive director michael ryan said india the world’s secondmost populous country has a tremendous capacity to deal with the coronavirus outbreak as it has the experience of eradicating the smallpox and polio through targeted public intervention i also believe the indian government has the capacity to fight against covid19 successfully however i am not in a suitable position to make any comment on indian economy  you must be keeping track of vaccine developments across the world who is closest to hit the target who are its closest contenders  scientists around the world are working on potential treatments and vaccines for covid19 there are more than 100 projects around the world centered on the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus as of may 11 eight candidate vaccines were being tested in clinical trials in people countrywise the us uk germany and australia are close contenders  how people’s life would change after the pandemic subsides what will be the psychological impact  i suspect many people will look back and see this time as a deep reflective time when things changed in their lives it’s true that this pandemic is far from a war but it requires pulling together and i feel when people realize what collective action can achieve it could change how we relate to others resulting in a greater sense of community without nation’s barrier although there are many to discuss in my lens three or four major things would definitely change let me address those here first people would definitely change their way of live work worship and play in future second in the postpandemic world digital world would be more powerful and dominant in our lives  additionally we may also see more government use of surveillance and on the international level there will be less cooperation which may affect our lives too in terms of psychological impacts people who are quarantined for long time are very likely to develop a wide range of symptoms of psychological stress and disorder including low mood insomnia stress anxiety anger

14,3 women speak of the horrors of romance scams during the lockdown,image pexelscom    “he steals your money the way he steals your heart effortlessly”    ever met someone too good to be true someone who knew exactly what to say to win you over the smooth talker the one who wants to know everything about you the one who makes your day and of course the one who is in desperate need of money and can only look to you to be their knight in shining armour well if you are someone who has experienced this then chances are you have been a victim of a romance scam  for the unversed romance scams take place when the criminal assumes an online or offline identity to gain affection and in the process the trust and confidence of a victim the scammer then uses the illusion to get money out of the victim if you have watched badrinath ki dulhania alia bhatt’s character experiences romance scam where the guy takes her father’s money and runs away  here are three stories from victims of romance scams who will serve as a tale of caution for everyone who could get involved in one  the bank account freeze  image pexels    madhurima works as an interior designer in bangalore she was swiping through profiles on a dating site when this nearperfect guy was right there looking for a friend in a lover intrigued she decided to get in touch with him the more they spoke the more she fell for him he always agreed with what she had to say and never once opposed her thoughts “for me it was a dream come true this guy was intelligent smart and had the same views on life as i did so far i had been considered as an outcast and often felt misunderstood but with him i felt like i belonged to him we spoke about how after lockdown we will travel to all the places in the world”    trouble began when he one day texted her that his account had been blocked and the bank said that they would unfreeze it after 48 hours he asked her if she could wire some money being in love with this perfect man she immediately wired it however for some reason he called her and said the wire didn’t go through after another two tries with the money being deducted from her account she thought she would call the bank authorities to clarify this however he started talking about how he trusted her and that she couldn’t even send that amount and that she didn’t trust him or love him “at that point i was desperate to hold onto him and show him that i did trust and respect him so i wired it at least around five times before i thought wait let me just check with my bank why it isn’t happening that’s when he told me that he couldn’t be with someone he didn’t trust since then i haven’t heard back from him what’s worst a part of me still believes that he didn’t get the money even though i know that this was all a scam”      lesson romance scammers often play on their victim’s emotions and feelings and manipulate them while asking their victims to pay for a plane ticket or help with visas  the freight charge  image pexels      reena dave a 32year old bachelor registered on a matrimonial website after being heartbroken on various dating sites “i wanted something concrete so i registered on a matrimonial website and within a day i got a match with someone too good to be true he was from the uk and was planning to shift to india he was kind generous from a well to do family and very handsome i thought to myself ‘wow i have hit the jackpot’ we started sharing a lot in fact he even helped me pick up something for a party and that is when the trouble started according to him he had gone and shopped some stuff for me and asked me to pay the freight charges at first i thought okay i’ll do it since he did shop for me however it just didn’t sit very well with me something was off so i told him i had already invested money and didn’t have that large sum on me to pay for the freight immediately after that he started giving me the silent treatment and blamed me for not trusting him he further told me about how he is glad he finally understood that money meant more to me i was in tears for most of the days but his bad behaviour just helped me get over him now when i look back at it i thank god that i didn’t succumb to the gaslighting tactics of that man”      lesson the scammer lured the victim into a false sense of affection and using this and a few gaslighting techniques asked for payment scammers often tend to be at an offshore place may send you something and ask you to pay the freight or custom charges which is nothing but a ploy to get the money in their accounts  sex tape scandal  image pexels      samantha a woman who had just broken up with her partner found solace in a guy she had met online “honestly looking back i think there were always these signs that told me this was a scam he was so perfect and so understanding that one day when he told me that he had found something on a website and he was running short of rs 10000 i immediately decided to help him after a few days it was something else and he had fallen short of rs 5000 this time i told him to pay me for rs 10000 first he was like sure so he sent me this request for rs 10000 on this app i told him if i say yes i’ll be paying him and not the other way around he then told me that since its a merchant account it works the other way like a fool i believed him of course the money was deducted from my account he said there might be a glitch and asked me to try again at this time i was furious and told him i wasn’t going to do that we soon got into a heated argument as a lost resort i guess he played the scandal card he told me that if i didn’t pay up he would leak my chats and my pictures on the net and that is when it hit me i had read about such stuff but didn’t think i would still end up falling for it for some time i was in shock but he kept making threats after threats i pulled myself together texted him ‘go ahead make me famous but i am going and launching an fir against you’ his messages stopped after that it’s been a week since that and i haven’t heard from him since there is an online fir facility i chose that”  lesson scammers often target women and homosexual men and women to get them to pay for the scammer’s silence please do not exchange pictures or personal details without meeting the person and even post that be careful with the lockdown just hold on before its safe for you both physically and mentally to indulge in conversations where you disclose yourself and make yourself vulnerable to the person  things to keep in mind about the scammer  they profess their love quickly  do a reverse image search of the profile picture if you can’t find it ask them to send you one where they are holding certain things like a ketchup bottle etc  they may say they are off social media profiles because of their past relationships  they are overseas and are planning a trip to where you are soon but the date keeps changing  things to keep in mind about the scams  online transactions are almost impossible to reverse  bills can be created on photoshop so if they send you a picture of the bill be careful  do not click on links unless you are sure of the content some links can be used to download malware on your computer or can be used to spy on you  authorities you can contact  if you met the scammer on a dating site or any other online site report their profile to the admin there  if you have sent a gift card quickly contact the company and tell them to cancel the card or block the card usage  you can write an fir online and the authorities will contact you asking for details and will ask you to visit a branch closer to your place  name changed to protect the identity of the person  also read 3 ways to master

19,why wait,do joyful people find meditation easier to practise than sad morose people is the selfrealisation goal easier to attain for happy people — raj 39 chennai    when we are happy and full of joyous excitement our prana life energy moves upwards this upward movement helps us in our spiritual practice we get better results in our sadhana if the happiness quotient of a sadhaka continues to increase then dhyana is deeper and quicker it is important for a spiritual practitioner to be motivated the yoga shastras say that a practitioner’s enthusiasm is a significant aspect of his sadhana it’s his first step towards spiritual progress if you are not excited about your spiritual practice then it is difficult to make progress on the path if you are sad and unhappy then your prana will soon start waning consequently you will not be able to concentrate this will allow all sorts of disorders to take root in your mind that’s why unhappy people are not able to be successful in their spiritual endeavours    happiness is the prerequisite for any kind of sadhana which is why gurus lay emphasis on satsang    through satsang an individual’s mental conflicts are resolved and he becomes peaceful once he is in a calmer frame of mind he can begin his sadhana just like stale musty fruits and flowers are not used as offerings in religious rituals like puja similarly a drooping unhealthy body cannot help you move forward in your sadhana that’s why it is important to start spiritual practices when you are younger and more energetic and it is even better if children are introduced to spiritual practices so start today for stellar results ■send your questions to steditorialtimesgroupcom with subject line ask surakshit and state your age
20,reformat your memory,  anil k rajvanshi tells us how to stop unpleasant thoughts and memories from affecting us adversely    from my younger days i have had the ability to sense when somebody is thinking about me this ability allows me to react even before the person has spoken or made his intentions known — most of the time with disastrous results    most people now and then do exhibit this ability of reading the mind and i feel everybody has this capability though they may not be aware of it    brain power    the brain is not only an instrument that can create thought but it can also send this signal and receive external thoughts we do have painful memories associated with people places and objects quite often negative thoughts from them bother us    how is the external thought received and is it possible to stop it from affecting us taking the analogy of modern computers or phone apps may provide a possible answer an app in the phone or laptop gets its update notification and data only when the app is on the instrument if the app is removed from the device then no data can be received though that information is in the ‘environment’    similarly if the painful memory of a person or event is removed from the brain then no thought about it can be processed by ithow do you selectively remove painful memories recently scientists have discovered that if we think about a certain person object or event then that memory becomes pliable that is it can be modified with a new memory neural pathways when active are amenable to modifications if at this time happy memories are remembered actively then they might weaken and replace negative thoughtsin a hypnosis session it is commonly seen that the hypnotist suggests new ideas and thoughts to the patient and these get implanted in the brainthis is useful especially when a patient is talking about a painful past episode this way unpleasant memories can be modified with new suggested memories but this is a dangerous process since the other person can play with the patient’s memory and there have been cases of false memory implanted in quite a number of hypnotised patients with harmful results implanting of new memory by oneself is difficultso a better way to do so is to practise yoga and meditation when one is immersed in deep thought on a subject for a long time then the majority of neural pathways in the brain are used mostly to focus on that thought this allows other memories to weaken and provides possible opportunity for removal of unpleasant memoriessanyam deep thought according to patanjali yoga can be cultivated with long practice and is the surest way to make the brain supple then unpleasant memories can be reduced and rendered irrelevantin such circumstances when external thought impinges on the brain then it will not be registered since the memory of that thought app is missing or has become corruptedoften when a virus affects the computer the best way to remove it is by formatting the hard disk weakening of memories by sanyam provide mechanisms in the brain to do just that and this is far better than tinkering with selective removal of memorythe loosening of memory also helps one in becoming detached it is memory that gives rise to attachment either to people or property when memory becomes weak detachment results that is the basic tenet of patanjali yoga darshan ■the author a scientist is director nimbkar agricultural research institute phaltan maharashtra

24,adding layers of bureaucracy between migrants and their job prospects is not the solution,uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath has proposed that states looking to hire workers from up would have to take the state government’s permission he said he will take this step seeing the treatment meted out to up migrant workers by other states according to him this would create a social security net for the migrants he also reiterated earlier plans to do skill mapping of migrants meanwhile a migrant commission to provide returning migrants jobs is on the anvil  the plan to secure up government permission for hiring migrants is likely to make experts scratch their heads the informal sector in which migrant labourers are needed operates even outside the ambit of governments a section of labourers get summoned to work by contractors but there is also a large population which moves to big cities and then try to find daily wage jobs given this scale of informalisation yogi’s plans may be a nonstarter  there is also the desperate migrant who is unlikely to wait for yogi’s permission to leave up for work just as he didn’t wait for centre or the other states to give permission to leave when the lockdown was clamped at fourhour’s notice yogi’s plan meanwhile will sit well with one group the bureaucracy a few hundred government jobs will certainly be created to man the new administrative layers mediating between lakhs of migrants and their jobs elsewhere the new department’s motto can be all for a few and a few for all

27,cleaner and now cheaper solar power beats coal,the covid crisis has diverted attention from a major breakthrough that should leave all smiling the latest auction for 400 mw of solar power including storage has been won by renew power with a levelised tariff of rs 352unit over 15 years the equivalent thermal power tariff would have been closer to rs 45unit solar energy has beaten coalbased power hollow and would do so even if taxes and cesses on coal were lifted the bulk of future power generation can be solar without subsidies  coalbased thermal power will still be needed as backup but very little new capacity is required meanwhile inefficient old thermal plants will be replaced by efficient new ones that implies a virtual standstill in future emissions of carbon dioxide sulphur mercury particulate matter and other pollutants india does not need additional carbon taxes to induce a shift to renewables the shift is already here  solar power has looked a bright prospect for years since the price of solar panels keeps falling however solar power is typically available only 30 of the time — it is not available at night or when clouds and pollution block the sun however thermal plants can work 80 of the time  during the day india now has excess power capacity solar generation is given priority while thermal stations have to back down till sunset priority to solar power makes economic sense since it entails no running costs whereas thermal power entails fuel costs but thermal plants that once ran 75 of the time have been forced to back down to just 5558 to accommodate rising solar production this hidden cost of solar power cannot be borne fully by the thermal sector which needs a new tariff formula to cover capital costs on generation and transmission when forcibly idled  in the giant 1200 mw bhadla solar park in rajasthan the winning auction in 2018 was just rs 244unit but it had no provision for storage something experts estimated would add rs 2unit to the tariff that meant solar power was not cheaper than thermal power and could not be switched on and off at will as thermal plants could  however the new 400 mw deal won by renew power includes enough storage to ensure 80 capacity utilisation over a year and not less than 70 in any month this is not quite 247 power but is as efficient as thermal power and much cheaper that is why it is a breakthrough  renew power will be using lithiumion storage batteries to store excess power during the day and releasing it later to achieve its capacity target elon musk of tesla plans to mass produce lithiumion batteries on a grand scale to greatly lower their prices while designed primarily for electric cars such batteries also make solar storage cheap  the biggest problem indian solar companies face is the high rate of interest this matters a lot in an industry with high capital costs rbi has lowered its lending rate but banks are too riskaverse to lend to solar companies which still pay 1011 interest on the bulk of their borrowing from public sector entities like power finance corporation and rural electrification corporation by contrast solar plants in the middle east can borrow at just 4 in their own currencies if indian companies could access money as cheaply the cost of power plus storage could fall to just rs 2unit transforming the competitiveness of indian industry india must aim for this  the world bank no longer lends for coalbased plants but is keen on renewables it cannot lend directly to private sector companies one solution is to negotiate massive loans from the world bank to power finance corporation and rural electrification corporation earmarked for onlending to the solar companies with a small markup  world bank loans to india can be repayable over 19 years with a 5year moratorium and interest at libor now just 017 in dollars plus 14 small loans are also available from the bank’s clean technology fund and ifc the bank’s private sector lending arm but past bank loans have been less than 100 million – peanuts for a solar industry that now needs billions the bank should step up solar lending hugely  problem this could hit limits on bank lending to any one country so it can be supplemented by bank’s power to guarantee commercial loans to the private sector a power grossly underutilised that can slash the interest rate new institutions like the brics bank and asian infrastructure investment bank can be tapped too that is mostly chinese money but so what
28,those convoluted govt circulars show what’s wrong with indian babudom,recently in a lighter vein i tweeted this about the complicated mha circulars “if you can understand mha circulars you can crack the data analysis and comprehension of cat or any entrance exam in the world easily” most people laughed but not all were amused a young ias officer replied “civil services exams are among the toughest in the world with patience orderscirculars can easily be understood read calmly because each word written in such orders matters” alright then i had been reminded of my place i forgot these orders were written by superior beings hence if i found the orders confusing something was wrong with me  this one example reflects the broader superior arrogant and unwillingtochange attitude that exists among many of our civil servants and yet one fails to understand this if they are so amazing why are india’s bureaucrats seen as a part of india’s problem why are they feared by the common man why are they cited as the main reason behind the difficulty of doing business in india  people talk about india benefiting from coronavirus as companies will want to move manufacturing out of china sorry but that will not happen firstly china is already back india is not the factories are buzzing there not here more importantly global companies are happy there they would rather risk a new pandemic than deal with indian babus  why are babus like this the entrance exam is where it begins there are two prelim papers nine mains papers and an interview this rigour could be appreciated if it made any sense you don’t need eleven exams to test the capability for being a government employee don’t laugh but one subject is ‘ethics integrity and aptitude’ it has cute questions like “what is expected of a public servant” and “describe a ‘crisis of conscience” one would think india runs one of the most honest services in the world if only integrity could be learnt by memorising answers another paper is about india’s heritage and geography cracking it requires massive amounts of rote memory in times of google maps and the internet the course content is as outdated as the font upsc selects for printing the question paper  of course appearing candidates don’t question the syllabus they simply follow the silliness to crack the exam a million plus people apply less than a thousand get selected half the seats are reserved it is a ridiculous exam curriculum and an equally ridiculous selection rate selection has as much randomness to it as merit the real skills needed for the job are never tested  the two years spent preparing for this mindnumbing exam sucks every bit of creativity initiative soul and enterprise out of the candidates those who make it also feel entitled — like they are superior and deserve something great now  they enter the great indian sarkaari system which rewards total risk aversion sit at your desk keep signing files you will get promoted try something new if it works no special reward but if it fails you are screwed what would you do in such a system sad that such capable people waste their lives in this system for what is not entirely their fault but while there may be a hundred things wrong with the system some fault lies within the civil services community which almost revels in being outdated and creating hurdles the recent complicated mha circulars weren’t just a joke they are a symptom something as simple as language page formatting and fonts have not evolved over the years really who apart from sarkaari babus uses the word ‘hitherto’  how hard is it to check online on the covid notices being released by hong kong singapore or the uk governments how difficult is it to simplify the language and make the page look more modern you may not get a promotion due to this but isn’t there a work satisfaction that comes from improving things this isn’t just about circulars it is about every sarkaari process why does everything sarkaari have to be boring dull and inefficient  of course change is not without risks recently a group of enthusiastic irs officers stepped out of line they made a plan to generate revenue post the crisis but drew enormous flak for it some would argue this shows that initiative is not rewarded but punished the action taken against the individuals was indeed harsh but that document had problems too the schemes recommended were archaic inwardlooking and antigrowth while making the document showed initiative the contents reeked of the same dated mentality open your minds see what other asian economies are doing nobody expects civil servants to be extra creative we are simply asking them to open their mind stay updated and improve things oh and simplify those circulars please
29,don’t let screens win over sports we need the grassroots game back,what we saw during the covid19 lockdown was unprecedented for sports there has never been an occasion when every major tournament in the world has had to be suspended or cancelled when the world wars of the 20th century raged wimbledon french and australian open were suspended for some years but not the us open during world war ii while firstclass cricket in england and australia was scrapped it was still played in india in recent times the great recession of 20082012 while it destroyed several economies had little impact on global sports  there is a glimmer of hope with the german football league bundesliga resuming last saturday and spain’s la liga set to resume from june 8 basketball nba and baseball mlb leagues in the us are wanting to restart soon and england is going ahead with its plans to host pakistan and west indies in cricket in july several other major tournaments too are in waitandwatch mode  for now matches will be without spectators in the stadium tv audiences and those on digital platforms are the target not the ideal situation to be in but a big step forward from having no action at all losses have run into billions of dollars for promoters federations team owners and broadcasters the livelihoods and careers of athletes are in limbo several businesses in the sports ecosystem have gone bust resulting in huge employment setbacks  it can get worse if cancellations and postponements of tournaments continue for instance bcci could suffer a staggering loss of rs 4000 crore if ipl does not take place this year the tokyo olympics deferred to 2021 has been the biggest casualty but in the wreckage are also tennis grand slam events football and cricket fixtures etc just about every sport even those played indoors except chess and esports  how quickly the sports calendar can be revived is the excruciating question confronting promoters international and national federations but an equally challenging issue — which has remained below the radar — is of restoring sport at the junior and grassroots levels  for some months now kids and youngsters have been cooped up at home without the scope to even practise even at the worst of times — during wars natural disasters and pandemics — children would find opportunities to play social isolation means not only are we restricted in movement but that children have been confined to screens for education entertainment and sport while technology is a boon in the first two instances its usefulness is severely limited in the third  romantics often write about how their childhoods were spent playing “outside” and how “today’s children” spend far too much time in front of technology a contagious virus is making the nostalgist’s greatest nightmare come true  longer the revival of junior sport takes the more adverse will be its consequences if say under12 u15 and u17 sport in india is severely restricted till end2021 it could throttle the supply line for the u19 teams in those disciplines certainly and perhaps have grave ramifications at the senior level too  there is also the mental aspect to consider a mother of a junior swimmer i spoke to recently said her daughter had frequent nightmares about being in the same pool with other participants risks associated with covid19 could play havoc with the minds of young sportspersons and guardians alike  the onus is on federations coaches heads of schools and colleges parents and guardians to tackle the problem on several fronts apart from establishing new protocols use of saliva or not with a cricket ball celebrating a goal et al medical expertise and counsellors will become paramount  most important will be how parentsguardians respond they must be convinced to see sport as an imperative not as danger to their wards that physical activity builds up immunity better than any medicine is well established there is no substitute for this moreover as sociopsychology studies reveal group physical activities at a young age are vital to understanding cooperation competition accommodation and assimilation — all of which shape our lives as adults only some part of this evolves into organised sport  at the crux physical activities at grassroots level is a more pertinent metaphor of existential wellbeing than planes and trains resuming service schools colleges cinema halls malls opening up shenanigans of the sensex etc — even elite sport being played for tv audiences children unshackled and uninhibited rolling in the mud happily running freely competing or collaborating vigorously thumping each other on the back without fear is the surest sign that life is back to normal
30,kindness transforms your inner  outer world,never has human kindness been more important than during the covid19 crisis kindness not just to other human beings who have lost jobs loved ones food on their plates freedom health dealing with abuse addictions and withdrawals but also kindness to starving animals on the streets to nature and most importantly kindness to the self selfpity selfflagulation is not being kind to ourselves to perpetuate misery is only going to magnify your own pain frustration grief anger and sadness i read this very interesting post that said “if a girl is carrying a very hot cup of coffee and someone bumps into her and the coffee spills… why did the coffee spill” people come up with many answers “because it was too full because someone bumped into her because it was hot and being held too delicately because etc etc etc” but the simple answer is “because there was coffee in the cup” same with emotions only what is inside you can come pouring out of you when you see people ranting and raving or pessimistic about the world economy life people relationships etc it’s only a reflection of what’s going on in them someone else will view the same situations and the same people very differently selfkindness changes everything the moment you are in a good place emotionally and mentally you will resonate with it and start seeing good around discovering the silver linings finding solutions and perhaps even helping others find their new set of eyes this lockdown has brought out the best in many and worst in many as well all of it is good because it can be hugely revelatory and cathartic to individuals and families as well a lot of frustration pent up over the years now have an outlet and for true healing to happen we need to empty out the garbage before filling it with something wonderful not that bad behaviour and negativity should be allowed to perpetuate and become acceptable in any manner but it’s important to observe when it’s a muchneeded outpouring and when it’s becoming a negative chronic way of functioning the keyword is kindness when you watch others suffer be kind to them when you suffer be kind to yourself verbally and emotionally shitting on everyone and everything around you isn’t productive empowering positive or a solution to any of your problems and if anything it will only make it worse break the cycle of monotony displeasure irritation and frustration with one simple word kindness the more you practice it the more your life transforms the more your cup is filled with kindness the more the chances of that kindness spilling over to others like a ripple effect kindness will transfer your inner world and your outer world the lockdown is hard on everyone everyone is fighting their own internal and external battles be kind  1 the covid19 lockdown has led to me spending a lot of time at home i live in a joint family and everyone has a say in my life i am a teenager and currently everyone is obsessed with underlining how important it is for me to learn to cook i hate spending time in my kitchen i don’t get why everyone insists that a girl should do this how do i get them to leave me alone and to do what i want to do  cooking is a skill set i believe everyone must acquire irrespective of gender it ensures you are able to provide yourself fresh nutritious food rather than being dependent on ordering in or eating junk food which do neither your health nor your wallet any favours however it doesn’t’ mean you need to make it your daily routine make a deal with them that you will be happy to be taught 5 ways to cook an egg and 10 favourite family recipes won’t take you more than an hour a day and after that it’s up to you as to how you spend the rest of your 23 hours  2 my husband has taken the lockdown to be a holiday from chores as he is working from home i am a homemaker but i have no help as my regular help cannot help me i want him to pitch in too how do i get him to do that  there are 24 hours in a day of which you sleep around 8 hours this leaves you both with 16 hours tell him if he is working for 8 hours daily so will you this still leaves you both for 8 hours for fun and time out calculate with him how much time it takes to cook 3 meals clean up and do laundry etc on weekends when he is not working tell him you will cook and he will clean or vice versa or it can be a fun “together” exercise put on lovely music make it fun for him to participate and get into the habit of it changing habits can be difficult but it’s much easier when it’s made fun rather than being yelled into it which creates resentment if he flat out refuses simply serve chips and boiled eggs don’t clean up and say it’s your day off too  3 in these times when we are all spending time at home together staying with older parents is becoming difficult as much as it was a pleasure at the start of the exercise it’s getting difficult because with advancing age they don’t like being restricted how do you think we can help them understand what is happening and why it is important for them to bear with us as we work for hours and even as we are home continue to have less time to attend to them  ask them if they would like to see you broke and jobless as over 12 crore people have lost their jobs due to lockdown add that the amount of work you put in is directly proportionate to the chances of keeping your job tell them you need their help and understanding as this job pays for the expenses of the home make a timetable with their inputs that demarcates work hours time together and responsibilities towards the home and make it look attractive with hearts and happy smiling faces drawn on slots for time together like morning tea meal times or evening post work and then put it up where it’s clearly visible they will feel included in the planning and not feel dictated to and will be at peace about it as it was all mutually agreed upon

38,life death crime kidney rackets underline the urgency of repairing india’s organ donation ecosystem,fruits of crime can outweigh its risks by a tempting margin so masterminds of a delhi kidney transplant racket busted in 2016 have been found running a similar racket in kanpur while they were out on bail underground kidney syndicates exploit the enormous demandsupply gap luring poor donors with a meagre sum and extracting an exorbitant one out of the receivers overall the organ allocation system is perceived to be corrupt such lack of trust also keeps it from growing as needed  the situation is far from ideal even in exemplar states tamil nadu has received the union health ministry’s best performance award for organ donation four times in a row with its transplant authority transtan maintaining a registry of patients in various hospitals and allotting organs of brain dead patients to deserving patients but there have been controversies about how organs are being allotted to vips out of turn in any case organs have been retrieved from only around 1200 patients indeed of the nearly four lakh people needing a kidney transplant across the country only around 8000 get it a key reason is that 90 of kidney donations here come from a living donor but elsewhere a majority take place after death  india needs a major uptick in cadaver donations to reduce the demandsupply gap raising awareness is obviously necessary but this needs to be backed up by widespread availability of suitable medical infrastructure such as the necessary surgical skills for removing and transplanting organs and the facilities for speedily moving organs to where they are needed states like haryana punjab and himachal pradesh have very few retrieval centres which keeps the organ donation rate forcibly low death can give life if our organ donation ecosystem is overhauled
39,how can twitter be better by taking a stand and being open about its choices rather than affecting neutrality,recently twitter was summoned to explain itself to a parliamentary committee because some rightwing handles felt they were being downvoted and rendered less visible this has been an outcry among us republicans too who accuse the platform of “shadow banning” muting a person’s content without their awareness  twitter says that its algorithm is only responding to behaviour signals – like how often an account is reported blocked muted liked and so on so it’s simply that spreading too much negativity has backfired on some highprofile handles  meanwhile those who spoke out against the targeting of kashmiri citizens in the aftermath of the pulwama terrorist attack have been subjected to intense concerted abuse journalists like barkha dutt have been sent detailed death threats and explicit pictures  when a swarm descends on one person the effects can feel catastrophic and crazymaking but twitter had been reluctant to react to this organised assault – instead its main grouse was dutt sharing a picture of male genitals that was sent to her as abuse  so what is the platform expected to do everyone resents twitter everyone expects better of it this is what happens when a little microblogging site which began with no bigger aim than chirping about your day to your friends ends up becoming the pulse of humanity the global public sphere itself  it’s now crucial to politics for ideological warfare for politicians to brand themselves and create a direct emotional bond with their voters it shapes the news it has linked and boosted protest movements and counter publics it has pockets and folds of brilliance it is also a partisan echochamber a fount of fake news and a place where women and minorities pay a high price for being vocal and visible it is time for twitter to decide whether free speech means unfettered anythinggoes speech or speech that allows everyone to converse without fear  remember that only five years ago we were still talking of web 20 as a participatory utopia we celebrated our new networked possibilities the destruction of intermediaries exulted that anyone could organise revolutions “at the click of a mouse” silicon valley companies cast themselves as innocent platforms for free speech as neutral as post offices any government that wanted to regulate them was seen as meddling with our freedom and our technological destiny  and then the epistemic crisis revealed itself – slowly it sunk in that social media had helped create a posttruth chaos the cracking of reality into separate partisan worlds free speech it turned out was also cover for a lot of disinformation propaganda zombie armies of bots – a tidal wave that could destabilise politics maybe even turn elections social media companies could not escape responsibility the handsoff technocratic pose was no longer tenable  platforms are not blank slates or open stages things don’t go spontaneously viral platforms actively organise what is seen and hidden they are “intricate algorithmically managed visibility machines” writes tarleton gillespie cornell professor and tech scholar in his book custodians of the internet about the hidden decisions that shape social media he argues that content moderation is not a side activity it is the fundamental thing that platforms do  they have three ways of doing this editorial review community flagging and machine detection editorial review is done by human judges a few employees at the company and a large number of outsourced crowd workers community flagging is when we the users point attention to problematic content and it gains from our specialised grounded expertise and capacities but it is subject to our vagaries machine detection though image or word filters is still being refined  all of these are easier said than done – whether it is blocking terrorist material or graphic violence or abuse it’s one thing to state the principle and another to draw the actual lines which are often ad hoc informed by past experience or future trouble so instead of hiding behind mysterious algorithms social media platforms would do better to define their values and what sort of public conversation they want to foster  platforms curate and shape what we see for instance twitter chooses not to insist on real names which protects political dissidents but also facilitates trolling it sets rules that determine what can trend often platforms play with light and shadows problematic posts are hidden in certain geographies and visible in others this may seem like good strategy but it also leaves them open to the charge of opacity and duplicity  perhaps as gillespie says the solution lies in more open editorial responsibility and not less rather than saying it’s just the algorithms platforms should be more open about what human and institutional choices dictate the algorithms don’t try to be all things to all people make principled judgments and then reveal those judgments  right now these platforms are sticky – to leave is to sacrifice one’s public presence so even those who complain bitterly about twitter are stuck with raging on it this situation is not permanent but twitter needs to make its priorities clear now – will it stand up against the systematic abuse of those who defended fellow citizens or will it be intimidated by those fouling the discourse it’s a stark enough choice
40,indiansaudi tango mbs commits to antiterror cooperation among other bilateral positives,with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman’s mbs visit to india coming on the heels of his visit to pakistan and the pulwama terror attack carried out by pakistanbased terror outfit jaishemuhammed one surmises that prime minister narendra modi pressed upon him strongly india’s concerns on pakistan as the region’s terror hub at a time when india is trying to diplomatically isolate pakistan mbs offering islamabad 20 billion in investment was jarring for new delhi however saudipakistani ties have a history that cannot be wished away on the other hand it’s welcome that riyadh under mbs’s leadership is looking to diversify its strategic engagements and sees new delhi as a reliable partner  while one positive from mbs’s visit was that he offered new delhi intelligence sharing and cooperation overall he took the relatively anodyne position that terrorism and extremism are common concerns meanwhile modi emphasised that the two countries had agreed that terrorism would not be supported in any form and that pressure should be brought on countries that back terror although there was no mention of pakistan by the two leaders this is the closest that the joint statement got to sending a message to islamabad  if there’s one country with even more influence in pakistan than china it’s saudi arabia and the saudis do not have an interest in containing india the same way that china has the best case scenario would be if riyadh could privately persuade the pakistanis to give up the terror tool – in which case riyadh’s refraining from public criticism would yield fruit in the meantime bilateral cooperation on other fronts should move apace it’s welcome that new delhi and riyadh inked five agreements during this visit including mous on saudi investment in the national investment and infrastructure fund tourism cooperation and broadcasting  missing was the deal to set up a refinery in ratnagiri maharashtra saudi aramco and abu dhabi national oil co together were supposed to have 50 stake in the 44 billion project however it has been hit by farmer and political protests forcing the maharashtra government to announce a shift in its location in fact land acquisition issues continue to stymie several foreign investments easing land acquisition and managing it better must be part of india’s economic strategy the stronger india’s economy is and the greater the stake other countries have in it the more will foreign leaders heed india’s concerns

83,common sense is about as common as a cure for covid,last week boris johnson addressed the uk public and instructed us to carry on using “good solid british common sense” to defeat covid19 that clearly worked out well given the uk’s coronavirus death toll is one of the highest in the world indeed the uk government has refused to implement a fullon lockdown adopting a lighttouch approach while countries like germany india and south korea have managed to keep a lid on the pandemic thus far by implementing much tougher controls  yesterday churches in the us state of oregon filed a lawsuit against the governor’s covid19 social distancing restrictions stating that “we all need to exercise our own common sense to voluntarily take steps which help protect against the spread of coronavirus”  are we the general public qualified to know what restrictions are needed to keep us safe do we have access to and the ability to understand “the science” are we capable of policing ourselves without prescriptive guidelines if common sense is such abundance why do we need rules and legal infrastructure at all  a lack of common sense and any sense of hygiene or humaneness is how the pandemic supposedly started in the first place now i’m only going by online pictures but i’m not sure how anyone could’ve stood in wuhan’s wet market and said to themselves “this makes sense let’s tuck into some live pangolin” i’m literally watching a sky news report from a wet market in vietnam now where the charred dog live rats bush meat and quite a few other animals i don’t recognize are still on sale one vendor laments that “bat meat sales are down” there’s hope yet  as corona made its way from china to the uk like a wave from the east leaving devastation in its wake surely one didn’t need to be an actual scientist to realize that some precautionary steps needed to be taken we were repeatedly told that the risk to the uk was negligible until of course it wasn’t and it’s become quite apparent during the course of the outbreak here that the government did precisely zero to prepare no attempt was made to procure ventilators or ppe in advance no testing contact tracing or border controls were enacted lockdown was introduced reluctantly and late by many people’s reckoning you’d think that common sense would’ve overridden the science given all the warnings and head start we had but it doesn’t seem so arrogance and ego often muddy the view unfortunately  indeed even as the lockdown was being introduced pm boris johnson stated that he would happily carry on shaking people’s hands he even boasted that he’d knowingly shaken hands with covid patients anything to get that one extra vote eh of course he ended up in an icu soon thereafter good sense is strong with this one  anyone noticed that the chinese and the japanese have been wearing masks for years clearly their experience with sars showed them that masks make a difference yet even now masks have not been made mandatory and most people in london are roaming around without any face protection again i’m no scientist but if this disease spreads through globules of spit it must surely add value to have some sort of facecovering while out and about indeed in countries where masks have been made mandatory the spread of the virus has been significantly lower  oh and forget about the 2metre distancing rule some folks either don’t know the difference between 2 metres and 2 feet or they have so much common sense that it renders them impervious to disease  naturally we british invented common sense that’s why we’ve spent the last four years trashing our relationship with our largest and most profitable trading partner with no backup plan – “spaffing” billions of pounds in the process we are so smart that even in the midst of the most devastating health crisis in living memory the government is endeavouring to deliver on brexit immigration promises the result of which could see the eventual deportation of low paid foreign nurses and careworkers we clap for them one minute kick them out the next after we’ve used them as guinea pigs to test hydroxychloroquine no doubt we may or may not have common sense but we certainly aren’t civil  meanwhile across the pond dettol and other disinfectant manufacturers had so much faith in the common sense faculties of the general public that they had to issue official health warnings against people taking their products intravenously after donald trump’s bizarre suggestion that it may be a way to cure corona it sounds like a bunch of “covfefe” to me  still in the us a group of citizens were so mad about lockdown that they broke all social distancing rules and entered the michigan capitol statehouse to protest they were armed with automatic rifles and handguns in the us this was regarded as a valid exercise of their right to protest in most other civilized countries this would have been classed as an attempted act of terrorism and dealt with accordingly how does common sense tell us that it’s ok for private citizens to keep militarygrade weapons at home common sense abilities supposedly improve over time through learning and shared experiences yet despite the countless mass shootings any attempts to introduce gun controls have been repeatedly blocked  in his 1775 pamphlet entitled “common sense” american philosopher thomas paine wrote “society is produced by our wants and government by wickedness the former promotes our happiness positively by uniting our affections the latter negatively by restraining our vices” based on this we are definitely up shit creek without a paddle on the one hand we have a government stumbling around haplessly in its fight against the pandemic failing to provide any leadership and on the other hand citizens ignorantly and petulantly push back against safety guidelines in a world where economics and selfinterest always trump sensible and considerate

85,the truly wireless phenomena is here to stay,do you remember the smartphone brand htc the one that was the poster boy and torchbearer of android smartphones before the chinese invasion and samsung’s emergence well no one would blame you if htc had faded into oblivion from your mind but the brand seems to be making a comeback there could be multiple jokes here but we will give htc a pass since it’s a different sort of comeback this time because it’s not with smartphones — that ship seems to have sailed at least for customers — but with true wireless earbuds it seems a pair of htcbranded true wireless earbuds were reportedly certified hinting at their arrival sometime soon  that’s the thing about the true wireless earbuds category at the moment everyone — even htc which posted a sixth straight quarterly loss in november 2019 — wants a piece of the pie and why wouldn’t they a recent report by counterpoint research suggests that true wireless wearables will clock 230 million units in 2020 the market as per counterpoint is expected to grow at 80 cagr in the next three years so yes it is a lucrative business at the moment and it is interesting to see how brands are going about to snag your attention  it’s a question that needs to be asked are you even a smartphone or consumer electronics brand if you don’t have true wireless earbuds anymore no oneplus however hard you may try to pitch the bullets earphones as “wireless” they actually aren’t and yes it is the only “big name” left to actually not have true wireless earbuds don’t believe it pick a brand and in the last 12 months or so you will see that they have had an offering or two in the true wireless earbuds market oppo realme microsoft amazon — all have made their debut in the market  one can understand why the market is taking off at such a tremendous pace the freedom of not having wired headphones that invariably get tangled is too hard to turn down the argument that “one more device that needs to be charged” also falls short as majority of us do have a charger on the go it’s about cutting the cord and a large number of people — if the market growth of this segment is to go by — are more than happy to do so  if htc was the torchbearer of android in the past then the whole true wireless phenomena can be traced back to apple and its airpods like most apple products when airpods were launched there were the jokes the criticism and the whole ‘whowillbuythesetoothbrushlookalikes’ brigade that came along but the success of airpods has shown brands a way and an opportunity to give users something they want so what if they think airpods are too expensive they really aren’t as they are the cheapest apple product you can buy as they are more than willing to give customers airpods clones at half or even less than half the price  earlier this year — at the time of ces 2020 — when brands were falling over each other to launch their airpods rivals a colleague wrote about how brands wanted “to be like apple and beat apple” in this piece she made a valid point of how getting ‘inspired’ by apple isn’t a new phenomenon and the true wireless earphones category is a case of like history repeating itself  apple launched the iphone and other brands — including htc — followed and the smartphone market despite recent setbacks has been on an upward curve htc expected to launch true wireless earbuds gives us a peek into the future of a wireless world and it is full of optimism and hope something that we all need in these current circumstances
86,india’s coronavirus relief package is the right size bloomberg opinion,when prime minister narendra modi recently announced a stimulus package for india he said it was worth rs 20 trillion — 265 billion equivalent to about 10 of the country’s gdp this seemed to fit in with the amounts being spent by some rich oecd economies to deal with the fallout from the covid19 pandemic equity markets exulted  in modi’s india though it’s usually wise to wait for the details now that they’re out the markets — and many economists — are disappointed actual spending is a fraction of what modi promised they argue — perhaps as little as 1 of gdp once equity traders added up the package’s components the markets duly sank back into gloom  in fact modi and his advisers have gotten it right and governments around the world could learn from their caution while india’s fastgrowing economy faces an unprecedented slowdown thanks to the pandemic — shrinking as much as 45 annualized in the second quarter of 2020 according to goldman sachs — spending on everything in sight isn’t the best solution  india’s policymakers found the correct prescription because they began with the proper diagnosis a bigger stimulus would have been the right way to address a crisis in aggregate demand but that’s not india’s problem until we figure out the best way to reopen the country needs less economic activity not more the real issue is the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the new coronavirus  instead of wasting money it doesn’t have the government has tried to address the problem we do have government spending works if no other event policy or signal can address the coordination problems that underlie a collapse in aggregate demand in this case we know there is such a signal an end to the current emergency in the interim what the government needs to do is figure out how to preserve those things that would allow the economy to respond to that signal — lives businesses and contracts  yes that can cost money and governments are the spenders of last resort but even more important than the government’s ability to pay is its ability to absorb risk and provide liquidity india’s rescue package is structured around precisely these strengths it includes the promise for example of roughly 40 billion in collateralfree loans to small businesses that would be completely guaranteed by the government  we can quibble over the details — it’s a mistake to limit such loans to existing borrowers for instance when lots of smaller businesses may want to borrow for the first time — but you can see the government’s rationale people who believe their business will recover can take on a loan for payments that they have to make banks will be happy to cover them since they’re being underwritten by the government instead of the government figuring out who to pay to reopen the economy banks and businesses will make the decision while we’ll have to see how it works in practice – any delays in the rollout and the whole thing will fall apart — the idea is sound  thanks to this focus on liquidity support and risk underwriting instead of acrosstheboard spending india’s debt might remain under control instead of exploding most importantly modi’s government has not been foolish enough to reverse decades of painful institutional reform and demand the central bank start monetizing its debt that would have spelled the death knell for india as a mature economy — and sent borrowing rates for everyone through the roof  if some economists are furious that’s because economists like generals are always battling the last crisis india’s government learned from it instead according to finance minister nirmala sitharaman after the 2008 financial crisis the government “just opened the floodgates and kept it open for a long time at the end of the day you had the 2013 taper tantrum doubledigit inflation and food inflation hitting the roof”  caution is wise unlike many of their global peers india’s policymakers seem to recognize that faced with an unprecedented emergency their primary responsibility is to keep things stable until it is clear how best to intervene it’s not to dissolve one institutional constraint after another on the pretext of fighting this crisis  modi’s economic record has been far from exceptional so how has his government proven so astute at this moment perhaps it’s because the prime minister himself is something of a fiscal hawk or perhaps fears that india might be downgraded concentrated minds in new delhi had ratings agencies downgraded india there would have been no chance of borrowing enough to provide stimulus when it might actually be needed — whether six 12 or 18 months from now  and yes more spending will probably be required if this emergency lasts long enough india’s poor will need direct cash transfers for example let’s hope that income support when it comes is as cautiously designed for now look to modi’s india as a global example not a disappointment
87,power of now in privatisations attempts to time the market to realise best price create more welfare loss than gain,by bhagwan chowdhry and prasanna tantri  one of the key announcements made by finance minister nirmala sitharaman as a part of the atmanirbhar bharat package is about privatisation we welcome the policy we especially like the intention to completely move out of nonstrategic sectors and limit the government presence even in strategic sectors we do have some concerns about its actual execution given that the government is trying to get the timing right  it’s understandable that the government wants to realise the best prize for its assets as any seller would but assuming that the government or even private players can estimate the right time when the prices will be higher is not supported by finance theory – if we could time the market we will all be rich without much effort  furthermore viewing privatisation from the narrow prism of bridging the current year’s budget deficit is myopic the most important goal of privatisation is to transfer the management of capital from the incumbent inefficient management to a more efficient management from a broad economy’s point of view it is the transfer of management of capital that matters and not the transfer price between two parties seen holistically even the government revenue is maximised with a quick and efficient privatisation rather than endless delays waiting for the right price  therefore as long as a fair and competitive process is followed timing should not matter as much from a welfare point of view in any case if the government sells something at a price below what would prevail later it would have ended up transferring money to many of its own private investors which should in any case be seen as stimulus spending in times of crisis  consider hindustan zinc the government sold its 45 stake for close to rs 750 crore in 2002 in slightly more than one and half decades the valuation went up more than 40 times the installed capacity more than 5 times and profits over 1000 times maruti is similar it used to sell 2500030000 cars under government control and now it sells close to 6 times as much its market capitalisation increased more than 45 times  the evidence is not restricted to selfselected anecdotes such as maruti and hindzinc nandini gupta professor of finance at indiana university has carefully studied partial privatisation and found that even partial privatisation improves efficiency the number of full privatisations in india are too few to conduct a scientific study  now consider air india the naresh chandra committee recommended privatisation as early as december 2003 when air india had significant market share and low debt fast forward a decade and a half air india is saddled with more than rs 52000 crore of debt and less than 14 market share the rs 25000 crore bailout implemented in 2013 has disappeared into thin air the only way government can hope to sell the airline now is by pushing the debt burden to taxpayers had the government bit the bullet 1015 years earlier air india would have created more jobs like hindzinc and maruti and that too without burdening the taxpayers  given these anecdotes and findings of careful research world over waiting for a perfect time to privatise is counterproductive delay wastes resources we suggest that the government go ahead with already planned privatisation of five large companies it will send a clear message to the markets about the credibility of the government’s announcements once credibility and trust are built the valuation of all pses on the block is likely to soar more than making up the loss on the initial set of companies  in fact the initial set of privatisations will create the right market conditions for future privatisations in addition government will realise benefits from increased future taxes from the companies themselves and their employees we sincerely hope the government completes the privatisation programme without chasing the illusory and expensive goal of timing the market  the writers teach at indian school of business

119,chronicle of a pandemic foretold,  the coronavirus pandemic has prompted people to recall a number of functional scenarios that narrate apocalyptic events one of the best known of these is stephen king’s 1978 magnum opus ‘the stand’ which in its fulllength version runs into 1703 pages and deals with a deadly pathogen which kills over 98 percent of the world’s population    perhaps one of the earliest fictional accounts of a global threat that wipes out all forms of life is arthur conan doyle’s ‘the poison belt’ which features the scientific genius professor challenger and was written in 1913    from the astronomical data he has collected and analysed challenger deduces that our planet spinning through space is shortly to pass through a zone of ether a gas commonly used by the medical profession of the time as a general anesthetic which can be lethal as an overdose    with his warnings falling on the deaf ears of a heedless officialdom challenger decides in the true spirit of scientific enquiry to shut himself up with a couple of his close associates in a hermetically sealed room in his sussex house    according to the calculations he has made the world should pass through the ether belt within a span of 24 hours or so    by keeping himself and his companions safe from the effects of the gas for that period of time challenger wants to prove to his own satisfaction that he has calculated correctly and that the planet would transit through the ether in 24 hours if he has miscalculated when he and his friends unseal the room and breathe the outside air – for they have no intention of staying locked up in indefinite isolation – they will also inhale the gas and perish along with all the other inhabitants of the planetat the appointed hour challenger flings open a window – and they breathe in clean fresh morning air the poison belt has been safely passed the small band of survivors ventures into london and sees people carriage horses lying on the roadside crashed automobiles with dead drivers slumped over their steering wheelschallenger and his companions face the terrifying prospect of being the only living beings in a dead worldthen slowly the ‘dead’ humans and animals begin to stir and come back to life the ether rendered them unconscious but did not kill them though there were fatal accidents such as car and train crashes the human race survives as do other living speciesthe book ends with challenger summing up the nearextinction as a somber warning from the cosmos to humankind which in its endless quest for greater and greater technological advancement and its desire to dominate nature oversteps the boundaries of its own limitations and becomes a threat not only to itself but to all lifechallenger likens the poison belt to a disinfectant that the creator in the role of a watchful gardener used to cleanse the grape of planet earth from the undesirable fungus of human arrogance and lust for powerit’s a haunting image which more than a century after it was evoked is all the more relevant in the context of the coronavirus pandemicexcept this time the poison belt it not out there it’s within us what disinfectant not just of the body but of the spirit can be devised to exorcise the toxin withinthat’s the real challenge

121,is your cough infectious,psychologists say that 90 of our activities happen as a result of selfhypnosis a man coughs and suddenly many others start coughing until now you were sitting quietly there was no trace of any coughing but one man coughs and you are suddenly reminded of coughing with that reminder hypnosis catches hold of you and your throat begins to itch now you are bound to cough this was a suggestion it functioned like a spell and now you will follow it    psychologists also say that the role of germs in this situation is secondary the role of hypnosis is primary that is what makes people sick or healthy your body functions in obedience to the commands of your mind even now at this very moment if the body falls sick it is only because it is obeying the mind and when it is healthy it is only obeying the mind when it becomes old it is only obeying the mind in living and even in dying it has your full agreement and command when old people die the deep reason behind it is that the moment they start getting old they start wishing for death young people don’t usually die and the basic reason behind it is not their youth the reason is that they don’t think about dying    death is less of a physical phenomenon and more of a psychological onehindu scriptures have called this maya hypnosis whatsoever you are doing whatsoever you are whatsoever your mental state is all your hypnosis if you are happy if you are unhappy it is all your hypnosis but your unawareness of it makes it very difficult for you to change it if someone is unhappy and you tell him that he is only hypnotized about being unhappy he will not agree with you because he cannot change itbut if you try some experiments with hypnosis you will be amazed if you hypnotise a person and then put an onion in his hand and tell him that it is an apple he just might eat it and say that it is an applethis ability of the mind is called maya in this hypnosis the world that people create together is almost magical the world that we are living in is our own magic we are crying and weeping and screaming in pain or this happiness is happening and that joy is happening and this trouble and that difficulty… it is all your own magic and the key to it is in your own hands  abridged from the flight of the alone to the alone osho times international courtesy osho international foundation wwwoshocom ■
122,new doorway to introspection,instead of feeling stifled under the lockdown shammi paranjape suggests we take this opportunity to do some soulsearching    with lockdowns isolation quarantine and social distancing being practised all over india and also in some other parts of the world in the wake of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic this is a good opportunity to make full use of seclusion to go in from out to do this is possible only in stillness and seclusion and by force of circumstances nature has though in a harsh and relentless way brought us to it we need to utilise this time for introspection and soulsearching    the primary principle of nature is balance when this balance is disrupted there is temporary chaos and readjustment also as human beings we have failed in our moral duty to the planet now we are forced to do it call it the law of natural ethics when a tipping point is reached a power mightier than all the combined strength of humankind starts operating    our disconnect with our higher self made us ignore our responsibility towards two deadly ‘viruses’ that have already been raging for a while on our planet these are virus of ‘excesses’ and the virus of ‘hunger’    deadly as these viruses are they have got scant attention    the hungervirus or virus of the poor afflicts and kills millions thousands starve and go to bed hungry whereas some among the affluent throw wasted food in the garbage bin minimal effort has been given to mitigate this callousness against humanitythe other virus — excesses brought on by ‘affluenza’ — has upset the ecological balance to earn a decent amount for family and self to lead happy and healthy lives is the common goal of all people but somewhere the equation has gone askew enough is never enough as greed has taken over leading to imbalance and degradation of the environmentit is being reported that the current pandemic was possibly triggered by mishandling of and consumption of unusual animals like bats if this is true then it is perhaps a good time to rethink what we eat sri sathya sai baba says “your body is a shrine not a burial place for innocent animals”he further elaborates that humans are no longer cavemen who need to hunt for meat to consume it for survival we have come a long way and have changed many of our habits to suit the need of the times he further says that consuming the flesh of animals passes on negative qualities and also the fear animals experience when they are slaughtered many healthy eating options are available this being the case why eat animals ■
123,corona karma,acharya gyansagar and monk anita didi discuss corona karma merit and traditional hygiene practices with sonal srivastava    we often come across the comment ‘corona is karma’ on social media the phrase loosely refers to human actions as being responsible for the coronavirus pandemic the virus spiral reportedly began in china where bats are consumed as food in such a scenario it becomes imperative for us to explore the ancient karma theory in the current context one among the three main karmic religions in the subcontinent jain dharma accepts karma as a yardstick of the natural justice system and has a welldeveloped philosophical structure that helps us understand how karma works    “there is individual karma and then there is collective karma collective karma that is all our karma put together influences everybody when we do good deeds as a society then we also reap collective merit it is our collective paap karma negative actions that we are being affected by coronavirus” so says anita didi monkdisciple of acharya gyansagar who is presently camping in baran a town in rajasthan    “we have to try to understand the jain karma siddhanta principle    we get fruits according to the karma we do and the intention with which we perform actions rishis have said that there are kashayas passions desires that result in our manifesting anything in this world their intensity varies they can be tivra fast or madhya medium kashayas” says gyansagarji explaining the different aspects of the jain view of karma “our suffering depends on the tenacity of our kashayas and our individual karma each one of us experiences suffering differently to get over one’s bad karma one has to do pashchatap penance merit can be accumulated by worshipping tirthankaras and by contemplating on their teachings the most important thing is to have karuna bhava compassion towards all living beings and to do seva in whichever way we can” says gyansagarji talking about ways to accumulate merit “we must also ask for forgiveness if knowingly or unknowingly we have hurt somebody” says the master as he reiterates the jain principle of kshama forgiveness kshamavani is an annual jain festival during which followers of jain traditions publicly ask for forgiveness of everyoneto stay safe during the current pandemic gyansagarji says that we must stay indoors wash our hands frequently with soap and water and make sure we keep them clean“we should ensure that we eat healthy saatvik food” he addsanita didi emphasises the importance of purity in jain dharma particularly when it comes to matters of hygiene “leaving your footwear outside before entering the home washing hands and feet several times a day especially before meals — these are all personal habits encouraged in all jain households these traditional practices only enhance the quality of life and now their relevance is being greatly felt by all”gyansagarji says that to overcome our bad karma it is vital to have atma jnana knowledge of the soul the body is just like a mobile phone without the battery the phone can’t workif karma is central to the existence of every being then what about the karma of the coronavirus — isn’t it accumulating a lot of bad karma “coronavirus is only a nimmitta medium through which we have to account for our bad karma we have to use our viveka intelligence and make sure that we perform actions without ego or sense of doership remember mahavira’s teaching — live and let live” ■
124,corona is here but where is karuna,the grave crisis that has developed worldwide due to the spread of a tiny invisible virus reminds me of the samudra manthan story the mythological churning of the milky ocean continuous churning went on for centuries in which devas and asuras both participated in the hope that great gifts would emerge instead suddenly a dark and deadly poison the garala emerged and spread worldwide devas and asuras fled in terror and it was only when shiva karunavataram the incarnation of compassion collected the poison in his hands and swallowed it thus containing it in his own throat which turned blue hence his name neelkanth that the churning continued and great gifts began to appear    if we consider the violent churning that the human race has indulged in over the last few centuries – the ruthless exploitation of nature the cruel destruction of millions of plant insect and animal species pollution of air earth and oceans the unsustainable high protein diets and consumption of strange animals and reptiles has at last thrown up a new garala that threatens the very existence of the human race    perhaps this is nature’s way of telling us to slowdown worldwide for a while so as to enable her to regenerate which she seems to be doing rapidly during the human lockdown periodto expect shiva to appear once again and contain this poison is to say the least unrealistic nonetheless we urgently need the compassion he embodied so that together we can meet this challenge this must extend not only to victims of the virus but to those millions whose lives have been uprooted in the process the sight of lakhs of migrant workers desperately trying to walk hundreds of kilometers to get back to their villages was heartrending have we seen a countervailing upsurge of compassion shakespeare’s immortal words in the merchant of venice are apt “the quality of mercy is not strained it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven  upon the place beneath it is twice blest  it blesses him that gives and him that takes”that is the karuna we need the present crisis has taught us that firstly despite attempts by several world leaders notably president trump to trash globalization the fact remains that in any major worldwide crisis we will all sink or swim together the ancient indic ideal of vasudhaiva kutumbakam remains validsecondly it shows that our basic health infrastructure remains woefully inadequate ‘sharir madhyam khalu dharma sadhanam’  the body alone is the foundation for all dharmas unless we triple the percentage of gdp that is at present allotted to health and education we will never be able to safeguard the welfare of the weaker and most vulnerable sections of society a restructuring of our national priorities is long overduethirdly this crisis has given us the opportunity to stay home look within and develop our intellectual and spiritual capacities regardless of which religion we may belong to we have to find within ourselves springs of compassion –karuna – that alone will be able to confront this deadly corona challenge we do not need large congregations just quiet prayer and meditation are much more effective as the upanishad says “within the furthest golden sheath resides the immortal brahmn that effulgent light of lights that is what the knowers of the atman know”
125,take this quiz and see how you fare,  humanity is taking a common reentrance test cet with the entire country in a lockdown the coronavirus pandemic is testing us as persons — personally and professionally personal test refers to management of our thoughts body and spirit professional test relates to dilemmas we face at work in any sector whether government private or selfemployed how we react or respond to the pandemic stems from who we were before the pandemic struck    this invisible virus attack has taken everyone aback no one imagined that we would need to practise physical distancing  being termed ‘social’ distancing  and live in fear of the person next to us someone you may have hugged shook hands with shared a meal with or even prayed with is now to be avoided in proximity    personal domain try to answer honestly the following questions    are you in control or in panic are you scaring people are you offloading your stress on others are you securing things for your basic needs or are you hoarding are you being helpful or inaccessible are you sleeping well are you looking at the time on your hands now as a rare opportunity or are you wasting it sulking are you willing to learn something new or you think it is too late    are you bonding with family and friends are you comfortable in your own company are you watching what you eat and drink do you have a fitness routine are you doing what you always wanted to do or are you waiting impatiently for the lockdown to end are you choosing your news sources for information or are you bingeing on doomsday predictions sensationalism and rumours are you expressing gratitude for what you have or are you waiting to settle scores are you a source of joy and help in the home or are you a pain do you share household chores and moreprofessional domain are you in command and control of your own responsibility or are you looking for an opportunity to pass the buck to someone else and absolve yourself of all responsibility are you staying well informed so that even by a minor intervention things may get betterare you audio or netconnected to colleagues or are you unavailable are you finding fault or working out corrective measures are you appreciative when something went right are you looking out for areas of strengthening the system once normalcy returns and more    we live in extraordinary times of unforeseen dimensions where we have to first protect our own physical space before we protect others we are surrounded by ‘an invisible enemy’ with power to invade even our tiny ‘space’ at any time whoever we may be with neither vaccines nor cures we need to take all precautions possible to avoid infection hence the need to conform with recommended guidelines on prevention    we need to also take care of our mental health keeping ourselves constructively occupied staying calm perhaps with the help of spiritual practices like meditation good reading and good listening    it’s both an external and internal challenge the world will never be the same once we emerge from the current crisis we need to reset our priorities and lifestyles as is being pointed out ‘planet earth is closed for repairs’    the same is true for us human beings as well    kiran bedi is lt governor of puducherry  
126,protect yourself from the fear contagion,  in the housing society where i live fear as well as common sense are prompting most residents to stay indoors but in the process they inevitably consume more and more doomsday scenarios being telecast 24x7 that tend to aggravate rather than assuage the fear factor this can lead to terrible mental agony for those who are neither strong nor confident enough to stay unruffled    jacebdebiec who teaches psychiatry at the university of michigan usa says “there’s a pandemic of fear unfolding alongside the pandemic of the coronavirus… watching or hearing someone else who’s scared causes you to be frightened too without necessarily even knowing what caused the other person’s fear”    not all fear is bad because of fear we safeguard ourselves from many dangers and risks “fear contagion can serve a valuable survival function” points out debiec “the reaction to perceived danger is fright freeze flight or fight we human beings share these automatic unconscious behaviours with other animal species”    the problem is of paranoia “robust social transmission of fear” has become ubiquitous despite our claim to being more intelligent than other species    fear of death tends to cloud rational thinking fear of hunger and poverty is very real for daily wagers which is why tens of thousands of poor migrant labour has sought to flee to reach their homes to be with family they had no idea where their next meal would come from and what they would do without work if only their fears had been addressed in time and they were assured of food and shelter they may have stayed put assuaging fear in times of crisis is vital otherwise the consequences can be fatalfor those of us who have the privilege of not having to stress about the next meal fearbased on facts and the growing numbers of virus victims may prompt us to take preventive action but fear itself ought not to become another more dangerous contagion that might make us even more vulnerable one of my neighbours refuses to step out onto her balcony for fear of getting infected she spends her entire day wiping down doorknobs and latches light switches and table tops scrubbing and dusting and so on with the result that she is a quivering bundle of jangled nerves jumpy and terrified though her home is now squeaky clean her family members walk around the house with trepidation treading on eggshells as it were for fear of alarming the lady who is utterly stressed out i hear she is now learning to meditate chant and even sing with the help of specific apps all of these seem to be having a positive effectthe rest of us are simply hunkering down working from home following recommended protocols waiting for the virus crisis to pass on blue skies clean air birdsong – the change is unimaginable in so short a time with commuting suspended and factories shut except that one cannot ignore the tragedy of so many succumbing to the disease globally and others losing their livelihoodsit is more important to transmit useful information about safety security and arrangements for basic needs to be met rather than repeatedly sound alarm bells about the virus only then more people will calm down and also begin the process of containing the fear virus as well

202,coronavirus how scared should we be,image copyright getty images  coronavirus has been described as an invisible killer what could be more terrifying than that  a deadly pathogen we cannot spot and then when it hits we cannot treat  it is unsurprising therefore that many people are fearful of going out returning life to normal or even letting children go back to school  people want to be safe but the problem is we are no longer as safe as we once were  there is after all a new virus around that can have catastrophic consequences  the need to balance competing risks  so what should we do some have argued restrictions need to continue until safety can be guaranteed but those arguments generally ignore the fact that continuing to do so carries risk in itself  uk chief medical adviser prof chris whitty often describes these as the indirect costs of the pandemic they include everything from poor access to healthcare for other conditions through to rises in mental illness financial hardship and damage to education  so as restrictions ease society and individuals themselves are going to have to make decisions based on balancing competing sets of risks  why you should not expect to be 100 safe  prof devi sridhar chair of global public health at edinburgh university says the question we should be asking is whether we are safe enough  there will never be no risk in a world where covid19 remains present in the community its about how we reduce that risk just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers like driving and cycling  image copyright getty images  she was referring to the row over schools but the concept can equally be applied to many other scenarios  she says part of that equation depends on the steps taken by government on things such as social distancing the provision of protective equipment and the availability of testing and then tracing of contacts to contain local outbreaks she has been critical of the way the government has handled all of them  how much risk do individuals face  but as more freedoms are returned the role of individual decisionmaking will come more to the fore  it is perhaps not about finding the right option rather finding the least worst option  statistician prof sir david spiegelhalter an expert in risk from cambridge university and government adviser says it has in effect become a game of risk management  and because of that we need to get a handle on the magnitude of risk we face  there are two factors that influence the risk we face from coronavirus  our risk of becoming infected and once infected our risk of dying or becoming seriously ill  if we are not in hospital or a care home our best guide to the risk of infection comes from the governments surveillance programme run by the office for national statistics  the data published this week suggests around one in 400 people is currently infected  the chances of coming into close contact with one of those individuals  certainly as we are practising social distancing even when out and about  is considered to be pretty slim although clearly some people depending on their jobs are at higher risk than others  the hope is that level of infection will reduce even further in time if the governments test track and trace programme keeps the virus suppressed  then if we do become infected the fact remains that for most people coronavirus is a mildtomoderate illness  only one in 20 people who shows symptoms is believed to need hospital treatment  how to quantify your risk  those with preexisting health conditions are most at risk deaths among under65s with no illnesses are remarkably uncommon research shows  perhaps the easiest way is to ask yourself to what extent you are worried about the thought of dying in the next 12 months  what is remarkable about coronavirus is that if we are infected our chances of dying seems to mirror our chance of dying anyway over the next year certainly once we pass the age of 20  for example an average person aged 40 has around a onein1000 risk of not making it to their next birthday and an almost identical risk of not surviving a coronavirus infection that means your risk of dying is effectively doubled from what it was if you are infected  and that is the average risk  for most individuals the risk is actually lower than that as most of the risk is held by those who are in poor health in each age group  so coronavirus is in effect taking any frailties and amplifying them it is like packing an extra years worth of risk into a short period of time  if your risk of dying was very low in the first place it still remains very low  as for children the risk of dying from other things  cancer and accidents are the biggest cause of fatalities  is greater than their chance of dying if they are infected with coronavirus  during the pandemic so far three under 15s have died that compares to around 50 killed in road accidents every year  identifying those at risk  so what seems crucial as we all try to balance risks is identifying those at significant risk of serious illness from coronavirus  whether we fall into one of those groups ourselves or have close contact with someone who does  currently the government is asking 25 million people to completely isolate themselves this includes people who have had organ transplants are having cancer treatment and those with severe respiratory disease  on top of those there are more than 10 million people who fall into higher risk groups these include all the over70s and people with health conditions ranging from diabetes to heart conditions  prof sarah harper an expert in ageing at the university of oxford has argued the blanket and arbitrary use of age needs looking at as the actual level of risk within this higher risk group varies enormously  a tool developed by university college london has attempted to tease out some of the differences in risk  finding out more about these is going to be crucial

203,coronavirus call for clear face masks to be the norm,image caption kelly morellon right and her mother sylvie have designed a face mask with a transparent window  its now part of daily life for many of us  struggling to work out what someone in a supermarket or at work is saying when theyre wearing a face mask  but for people who are deaf or have hearing loss masks can prevent them understanding anything at all  you might as well be speaking in french says fizz izagaren a paediatric doctor in the uk who has been profoundly deaf since the age of two  i can hear one or two words but its random it makes no sense… when someone is wearing a face mask ive lost the ability to lip read and ive lost facial expressions  i have lost the key things that make a sentence  it is a problem she shares with the some 466 million people around the world who according to the world health organization have disabling hearing loss  standard face masks which have become widespread as countries try to stop the spread of coronavirus muffle words and obscure the mouth  but now charities and manufacturers alike are coming up with a solution  image caption fizz izagaren says she feels isolated when everyone around her is wearing a standard mask  main dans la main hand in hand an association which supports deaf and hearing impaired people in chevrières northern france is among the organisations around the world that have created a mask with a transparent window  its founder kelly morellon worked with her mother sylvie to devise a design that covers the nose but makes the mouth visible and can be washed at a high temperature to reduce infection  the basic aim of these transparent masks is to allow deaf and hearing impaired people to read the lips of someone speaking to them kelly told the bbc  but they are also very useful for autistic people people with learning difficulties and small children who might be scared of masks or need to be able to see facial expressions  in any case a transparent mask allows you to see each others smiles and at this sad time this could not be more important  image caption the clear screen in kelly morellons design can be removed so the cloth can be washed  unlike some companies around the world  in scotland the us and indonesia for instance  kelly and her mother are not able to produce their masks on a commercial basis  instead they are advising people on how to make their own and there are multiple guidelines online to help their top tip is to use a little washing up soap to stop the plastic screen fogging up  but one setting where homemade masks are not suitable  but where both ppe and communication are vital  is in hospitals  there is just one company in the us that has secured food and drug administration fda approval to make clear masks for clinical use  five hundred of these masks are being used at brigham and womens hospital in the us city of boston at the moment they are being reserved for staff to wear when they are speaking to patients with hearing loss or vice versa sign language interpreters who use facial expressions and lip movements alongside body movements to create more complex and culturally rich signs also wear them  image copyright brigham and women’s hospital image caption james wiggins an american sign language interpreter is among the staff at the brigham who have been wearing the transparent masks  when we saw the covid19 pandemic beginning… we soon realised there was going to be a challenge because of the escalated use of ppe and how that would create communication barriers said dr cheri blauwet who leads the disability task force at the brigham  weve had glowing feedback from patients and were getting broader requests from other parts of the hospital especially the paediatric floors  in the uk there are no approved manufacturers providing clear masks to hospitals and the sole us manufacturer is not taking any more orders as it deals with overwhelming demand  fizz izagaren a paediatric registrar at frimley park hospital in surrey in the uk who is also deaf says standard masks prevent her from taking patients histories verbally she also says she feels isolated at work because she is not able to speak to her colleagues  clear masks should be the norm for everyone in a healthcare setting she says  image copyright epa image caption the elderly are both more at risk from coronavirus and more likely to have hearing loss  she is now working with a product designer to try to come up with a mask that the nhs could use widely but even once a design and a manufacturer are found this could take time to roll out  in the meantime there are concerns the current ppe could stop medical staff getting the required consent from patients  an intensive care nurse working in london who is profoundly deaf told the bbc she had one experience where a patient who also had hearing loss was not able to understand her or her colleagues when they were explaining a procedure the patient could not give consent and the procedure could not go ahead  clear masks would make things a lot easier for me she said  i would be able to do my jobs properly and safely i would have more independence rather than having to rely on others  in the uk eight charities have written to nhs bosses calling for clear masks to be commissioned warning of potentially dangerous situations arising from communication problems nhs england has not yet responded to the letter or to the bbcs request for comment  the uk government says it is supporting cardmedic which provides digital flashcards and other communication aids to nhs trusts there are also apps that transcribe speech into text on a mobile phone  but deaf workers say these workarounds are not always suitable for sensitive or emergency situations  as masks become more widespread in the community  its going to get harder and harder dr izagaren says  im worried the public are going to get more and more frustrated and there will be more discrimination towards the deaf community  it is not just people with hearing loss who could benefit she says  experts suggest that other professions such as taxi drivers or even teachers may find clear masks useful as the coronavirus crisis continues  a niche product initially designed to help the deaf community could in fact make everyones lives better

much higher than the reported figures as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted  globally more than 45 billion people  half the worlds population  have been living under social distancing measures according to the afp news agencys estimates  those restrictions have had a big impact on the global economy with the international monetary fund warning the world faces the

trajectory  as shown by the red lines  there is particular concern about the situation in brazil where more than 22000 people have died  the countrys president jair bolsonaro has repeatedly downplayed the risks of the virus and is pushing for restrictions on businesses to be eased  brazil now has more than 360000 infections the second highest number in the world and it is thought that the real number could be much higher due to a lack of testing  bruno covas mayor of brazils largest city são paulo which is home to 12 million people has warned its health system could collapse because of the growing demand for emergency beds  on sunday the us announced travel restrictions on people who have visited brazil in the last 14 days though it doesnt apply to us citizens  mexico has also seen a

and nurses in italy have been celebrated as heroes for treating desperately ill coronavirus patients  but now they are suffering  lombardy was the hardesthit region in the world and medics are struggling to hold it together  paolo miranda is an intensive care nurse in cremona im more irritable he says i get angry easily and i pick fights  a few weeks ago paolo decided to document the bleak situation inside the intensive care unit by taking photographs i never want to forget what happened to us it will soon become history he tells me  image copyright paolo miranda image caption we had an enemy to fight now that i have time to reflect i feel so lost aimless  in his photos he wants to show how his colleagues are coping with phase 2 as life goes back to normal in italy  although the emergency is slowing down we feel surrounded by darkness he says its like we are full of wounds we carry everything weve seen inside us  nightmares and night sweats  its a feeling echoed by monica mariotti also an intensive care nurse things are much harder now than during the crisis she says  we had an enemy to fight now that i have time to reflect i feel so lost aimless  during the crisis they were overwhelmed and had no time to think but as the strain of the pandemic fades so does the adrenaline  all the stress accumulated in the past few weeks is coming to the surface  image copyright paolo miranda image caption its like we are full of wounds we carry everything weve seen inside us  i have insomnia and nightmares monica says i wake up 10 times each night with my heart racing and out of breath  her colleague elisa pizzera says she felt strong during the emergency but is now exhausted  she does not have the energy to cook or take care of the house and when she has a day off she spends most of her time sitting on the couch  no new normal  martina benedetti is an intensive care nurse in tuscany and still refuses to see family and friends as she fears she could infect them  i even social distance from my husband she says we sleep in separate rooms  image caption im not sure i want to be a nurse anymore  even the simple things have become overwhelming every time i try to go for a walk i feel anxious and i have to go back home immediately martina admits  now that shes finally got time to reflect she is full of selfdoubt  im not sure i want to be a nurse anymore she tells me ive seen more people die in the past two months than in the whole six years  some 70 of health workers dealing with covid19 in italys hardesthit areas are suffering from burnout a recent study shows this is actually the hardest moment for doctors and nurses says serena barello the author of the study  when we deal with a crisis our body produces hormones that help us handle stress  but when you finally have time to reflect on what happened and society is moving on it can all come crushing down and you feel more exhausted and emotionally distressed says dr barello  image copyright paolo miranda image caption suddenly we all became heroes but theyve already forgotten us  she worries that a lot of doctors and nurses will have posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd symptoms long after the pandemic this is when the impact of a traumatic experience affects a persons life sometimes months or even years later  for health workers this could impede their ability to keep working with the intensity and focus their jobs require  forgotten heroes  around the world frontline doctors and nurses are being hailed as heroes for risking their lives to treat patients but in italy this love is ebbing away  when they were scared of dying suddenly we all became heroes but theyve already forgotten us says monica  we will go back to being seen as people who wipe asses lazy and useless  image copyright paolo miranda  in turin nurses recently chained themselves together and wore bin bags a reference to how they had to improvise in wards because of a lack of ppe  they staged a protest to demand recognition for their work  in march we were heroes now weve already been forgotten one nurse shouted through a megaphone  they were promised a bonus for their work but have not yet seen it  no escape  at least 163 doctors and 40 nurses died from covid19 in italy four of them took their own lives  and yet many health workers now feel that its almost as if this pandemic never happened i feel overwhelmed with anger says elisa nanino a doctor who dealt with covid19 in care homes  since the lockdown has been lifted she constantly sees people drinking and eating together with no face masks and no social distancing  i want to go up to them and scream in their face tell them theyre putting everyone in danger she says its so disrespectful to me and all my colleagues  one thing all the health workers agreed on is that public support helped them get through the crisis  image copyright paolo miranda  im no hero but it made me feel important paolo says  public recognition is the most powerful way we have to help health workers struggling with ptsd according to dr barellos study  all of us we have a crucial role to play right now she says we have to make sure we dont forget what doctors and nurses did for us  soldiers can leave the battlefield and deal with their trauma back home but for these doctors and nurses the next 12hour shift is always around the corner  they have to cope with all of this in the very place where they suffered so much  i feel like a soldier that has just returned from war says paolo obviously i didnt see weapons or dead bodies in the street but in many ways i feel like i was in the trenches
229,coronavirus the strangers reaching out to kyrgyzstans lonely teenagers,image copyright afp image caption kyrgyztan has been under a curfew since march  like teenagers around the world maksat hasnt been to school in weeks as kyrgyzstan imposed quarantine restrictions the 15yearold feels isolated like never before he has been trapped at home with a sister he doesnt get on with a father he struggles to communicate with and a mother working abroad  he is comfortable talking only to an internet chat bot  maksat not his real name feels alone and misunderstood he often expresses suicidal feelings  a noticeable change his teachers say from the boy they knew before the curfew was brought in  and then he met a phone pal  jalalbek akmatov a university student in the capital bishkek  jalabek is one of around 100 young adults taking part in a project to reach out via phone to teenagers just like maksat thousands of whom have been stuck at home for weeks  the scheme  called you are not alone  was launched after seven teenagers took their own lives in the first two weeks after kyrgyzstan started coronavirus lockdown in in march  image copyright handout image caption jalalbek akmatov is one of more than 100 volunteers acting as phone pals to lonely teens  at the time the nations attention was on the poor medical facilities lack of protective equipment and impact of coronavirus on the economy  but as news of the teenagers deaths spread a group of activists decided there was also a need to focus on the countrys children and their mental health  i was dismayed we had had one coronavirus death and during the same period so many children committed suicide said banur abdieva one of the projects founders  there is nothing to say the seven deaths were directly related to the lockdown but people like kurmanjan kurmanbekova a psychologist from a refugee centre in tubingen germany feared the strain it was putting on childrens mental health  and as a symptom of depressive conditions we get a suicide mood she explained to the bbc  schools closing in kyrgyzstan mean many children have limited options for interaction especially in rural areas where education offers a respite from the relentless drudge of housework and a rare opportunity to communicate with other children  added to this were concerns from experts over any potential increases in domestic violence which could possibly be exacerbated by isolation and parents loss of income  but how do you reach teenagers like maksat who live in remote villages  getty kyrgyzstan in numbers six million people live in kyrgyzstan  21 million of them are children  one in five do not live with their parents  almost 73of children report experiencing abuse or neglect source unicef  the answer the project team decided was to keep it simple  to start a network of volunteers who would befriend teenagers considered at risk by calling them up for a regular chat  their aim is to show moral support and engage in social interaction so that the child doesnt feel total isolation ms kurmanbekova explained  volunteers approached local schools and state education agencies which sent them a list of students in a group of risk  mostly children without parents or who live with relatives and may lack attention and care  there are now more than 100 volunteers and nearly 400 children aged 12 and

themselves instead they focus on their new friends future goals and potential  image caption volunteers meet on zoom to discuss strategies how to bond with their new friends  take volunteer ayperi bolotzhanova who is 25 she bonded with her 12yearold phone pal over taekwondo  i offered to teach her some tricks and she agreed said ayper now i send video of my practices and she sends back her own  but it is not always easy to take the first step the volunteers admit  i was very nervous before my first phone conversation jibek isakova who currently lives in budapest recalled i was afraid that she would refuse to be my friend  of course there was distrust a total stranger calls you up out of the blue and offers friendship but most of the volunteers found their mobile relationship took off after a few conversations indeed the volunteers were surprised how most teenagers were keen to talk to them  what do they want to discuss other than the skills needed to milk a cow  a musthave in rural kyrgyzstan  theyre much the same things teens across the world want to talk about kpop instagram the difficulties of finding love drawing famous japanese cartoon characters and learning languages were other topics that cropped up  and they were all united in one thing how much they hated online education during the quarantine  you may also be interested in  media playback is

jalalbek got particularly excited that  after a difficult start  maksat sent a photo of him together with his family in the mountains  for some volunteers the cause is very personal eldiyar manapov 24 joined the project because he considered suicide as a teenager like his phone pal he grew up without parents and now feels a particular connection with his new friend  i experienced what he is going through now he told the bbc you are constantly in need of some things like clothes children mock you that you dont have parents i dont want him to feel all this pain i want him to chat to be distracted  even though the idea is simple the challenges the activists face are not one of them  a lack of mobile phones  could easily derail the whole project  its very difficult to build a phone friendship when most children dont have personal phones said banur abdieva volunteers have to negotiate with parents or guardians sometimes they even ask teachers if they could come to the gate at a designated time and its quarantine so they need to sanitise their phone and pass it on to the child  activists launched a fundraising campaign to buy phones for the project some people donate their used phones which volunteers try to deliver to children living in remote regions a challenge on its own during the lockdown  just imagine how happy my friend will be if he gets his own device said eldiyar whose phone pal is using a mobile belonging to a cousin he will be able to learn more and communicate more that means he will have less time for all bad thoughts  if youve been affected by a

231,i left my campervan in argentina,image copyright radka and ivar  imagine breaking free you sell your possessions buy a van pack it with what you need and go for months or years you live a frugal life going wherever you want but for thousands who made this dream a reality coronavirus brought them to a sudden halt writes paula dear and left them stranded with a van and a vanload of kit on the far side of the world  for radka and ivar the plan began to form when they met in 2016 both working as personal carers for a disabled man in trondheim central norway they would cross paths as she finished the night shift and he took over for the day  we met for like five minutes to change the shift i was very charming in the morning jokes radka  and then you would stay for breakfast sometimes ivar adds  radka was the more experienced traveller she had previously hitchhiked from russia to southeast asia and was preparing to do the same from argentina to alaska but after falling in love with ivar who was in the process of retraining as a nurse she faced a dilemma  there were lots of conversations i said you have to promise me that once youre done studying youll go with me it was a dealbreaker and ivar adopted my dream very quickly she says  in the meantime radka took a sixweek trip to patagonia with a friend and at one point hitched a lift with a woman called silvia from ushuaia in argentina the worlds southernmost city they stayed in touch and three years later this would turn out to be a critical stroke of luck  radka and ivars plan slowly morphed from backpacking to travelling the americas by van and they picked up a secondhand toyota hiace with help from radkas dad they built a basic bed and kitchen in the back and storage for their gear  including climbing and freediving equipment bicycles and an inflatable canoe  we needed a van because ivar has a shedload of sports stuff says radka but also its the freedom of it when we are inside the van with gas for two months and food for several weeks we can be totally off grid we thought it would be great to have comfort and the ability to drive wherever we want  image copyright radka and ivar  ivar whod previously been a climbing instructor studied hard for his nursing degree and they worked every single job that came our way to save money says radka who would often finish a nightshift and go on to do cleaning jobs before having four hours off ahead of the next nightshift  she developed terrible sleeping problems she says i burnt out and made myself ill but i did it because i had a dream and i wanted to make it come true  in the flurry of preparations they were still making lastminute modifications to the van on the day they drove it to the port in germany for its voyage across the atlantic and through the panama canal to chile  six weeks later in early january they were in san antonio to collect it and begin their epic journey it was the height of summer and their plan was to loop down at a leisurely pace to the southern tip of argentina  the symbolic start of their onetotwo year trip  and then drive north all the way to alaska  so stopping frequently they slowly headed south enjoying hikes in the chilean island of chiloé and argentinian trekking hub of el chaltén and a trip to the 5kmwide perito moreno glacier camping out in nature soon started to smooth out radkas erratic sleeping patterns  el chaltén was absolutely amazing says radka who had long fantasised about photographing the famous fiery reds and burnt oranges and yellows of the patagonian autumn which by this time was already beginning  but the weather forecast was bad so we said lets go to ushuaia and when we come back this way its going to be even nicer colours ivar says  by this stage they were hearing reports of covid lockdowns in europe but were reassured by friends in argentina and chile that similar moves seemed unlikely there  we were discussing whether we should go to ushuaia or not because its locked in with a chilean part above it but there really wasnt any news and when we asked people they said it was just recommended to wash your hands no more so we decided to go and then it all happened really quickly and we couldnt get back out says ivar  image copyright radka and ivar  hours after they arrived on 15 march the borders unexpectedly closed trapping them on the argentinian side of tierra del fuego island which can only be exited via a chilean ferry  with people being ordered to stay at home or in hotels they decided to drive out of the city and wait out the initial 14day lockdown in their van as camping was banned they had to conceal their plans from the police when they encountered a checkpoint at the edge of ushuaia an hour north at a forest lake called laguna margarita they found a spot to wildcamp  we were afraid someone would see us and report us but we were really deep in the woods and nobody came says ivar  when the weather allowed they paddled on the lake or went running ivar taught radka how to ropeclimb in the trees it was tough going at times too the wind and rain often forced them inside and there wasnt enough sun to replenish their solargenerated electricity on day two they ran out of cooking gas and they were washing in nearfreezing water  but they werent too worried once the twoweek confinement was over they would return to el chaltén and wait out the crisis  they could happily spend months hiking in the national parks mountains the lack of gas however forced them to drive back towards ushuaia and when they picked up a phone signal again it became obvious the crisis was deepening national parks had closed they read increasingly desperate reports from fellow nomads on facebook forums  moreover they were really afraid they would get into trouble from the police for camping in the car during lockdown we didnt know how to explain where wed been for those two weeks or where we were going says radka she messaged silvia the woman who had given her a ride in 2016 could she vouch for them or provide an address  en route back to ushuaia they hit a police checkpoint  they were filming us and the car asking where we had been where we were going we tried to tell them wed been camping but we dont speak good spanish im not sure they understood says ivar  we were so stressed we then took off in the wrong direction when we turned back we were met by two police cars with sirens  the officers werent pleased  they said they would escort us to our hostel in ushuaia they didnt realise we didnt have one  on the way radka tried silvia again and luckily she responded within the halfhour drive she had secured them a friends rental apartment and they were escorted right to the door by the police  image copyright radka and ivar  two weeks of lockdown in the apartment followed it was much like those seen elsewhere with trips to the supermarket or pharmacy allowed and little else  for the first few days we felt ok bingewatching tv series enjoying hot showers but we started to realise this was not going to be a situation for a couple of weeks and that we really couldnt afford to pay for accommodation for up to six months because even if they then opened the borders wed be out of money we were quickly getting more and more tired and depressed and i started having problems sleeping again says radka tearfully  when you are at home i imagine you find things to keep yourself busy  clean or paint or bake whatever but being in a foreign flat in a foreign country where you were not planning to stay its maybe different says radka you cant focus on doing something new you spend your day researching every desperate possibility to get out of there we were even looking at whether it was possible to sail across the ocean and when each one is a dead end it feels like such a waste of energy and motivation  ivar adds its like waiting in a bus stop when you dont know exactly when youre going to leave and its not the place you want to be  but the decision to leave wasnt straightforward it slowly crept up on them says ivar it kind of evolved from possibly going home because its going to be boring to wait to realising if we stay three of four more months our wellbeing might suffer  when radka received an sms from the embassy to say there were repatriation flights from the capital buenos aires she felt an irresistible pull homewards  i felt a bit like a failure when i started to consider going back we have friends who are staying it was like we were giving up but everybodys situation is different  radka and ivar are part of a sizeable community of people who travel and live in vehicles for months or years at a time  sometimes permanently  and are known as overlanders or vanlifers some work as they go along or stop for a while to volunteer others have already retired ask them to stayathome and well it can be a bit complicated where  you might think that as they are equipped to live offgrid they would be fine during lockdown in reality their lifestyle choice depends on the ability to move around camp and access services like water power gas and toilets with regional and national borders closed most campsites shut and wild camping banned outsiders being discouraged in many areas and bureaucratic headaches over visas and complicated vehicle permits thousands of travellers around the world are either trapped or having to abandon their homes on wheels and return home  in some ways covid19 has been like a game of musical chairs for overlanders who have found themselves in varying situations depending on where they happened to be when the music stopped  around 10000km north of ushuaia in the colombian city of medellín berliners anne and martin are living in their vw westfalia camper in the driveway of a hostel where they can use the toilets and showers that wouldnt be allowed in many places under lockdown but they happened to be staying there while fixing some mechanical issues when the crisis began the owners allowed them to stay and they decided to sit it out in their van  image copyright anne and martin image caption anne and martin when the going was good  for us there was never a question of leaving the van behind says anne  we also didnt really see the point of returning back to europe as the number of infected people was much higher than here we dont have a home as we moved out of our apartment and sold all our belongings we could stay at our parents places but in our mid30s its not really our goal  the days are getting really long and repetitive we are safe and healthy but we are stuck we miss being on the road she says  radka and ivar missed it too but they couldnt see a light at the end of the tunnel luckily the airport in ushuaia reopened and they booked a flight to buenos aires the van and their gear would have to stay behind but with strict rules in most countries including argentina about how long a foreignplated car can remain there they had just one day to work out the logistics and find a place to park it again through silvias network they managed to secure written permission from a resident who would allow the van to be parked at his house and a letter from the customs authorities enabling them to leave it behind until the crisis is over  it was a stressful day we really hope that everything is ok with the papers says ivar its incredible how it worked out although when we parked the van and left it there i was nervous about handing the keys over because we had never met the guy theres a part of us thats afraid we wont see the van again maybe well show up and theyll be like what car  image copyright radka and ivar image caption radka on the journey south in los glaciares national park  after they arrived in buenos aires their repatriation flight was refused permission to fly just before the next flight a week later they were told they hadnt made the list for nearly three weeks the couple waited in a cheap hostel room in the city feeling increasingly despondent they started to question whether they really would get out finally on 7 may they boarded a norwegian air flight to oslo costing them €1300  back in norway they had to complete 10 days of quarantine but were lucky to have access to a rural family cabin where they sat it out in peace  we have gone through all the emotions… but right now were just really happy to be back in norway says ivar  on a scale of one to 10 the disappointment is 11 says radka  the longer we stayed and the worse i felt i said ok i admit it i cant imagine spending another four months like this so im willing to spend some of our savings on going home to norway where people have a bit more freedom i was going crazy  the selfconfessed pessimist of the pair she worries about whether they can gather the funds to return to argentina and if they do whether tourists will still be welcomed under the new normal  and i feel like we have lost time if we start the trip again in say january that was a time when we were supposed to be somewhere else in our life i have a hard time letting go  a few months in norway will give them some perspective says ivar  we would have felt worse if it was something that we should have seen coming i think we did everything we could and i am at peace with that i feel like were pretty lucky compared with many other people i know we will continue the journey  our car is in tanzania we could be fined €1400  many overlanders who have abandoned their vehicles are risking penalties from fines to confiscation for failing to drive their van out of the country by the time agreed when they entered when you drive into a country you usually temporarily import the vehicle for a fixed period after which penalties begin to be imposed  image copyright armin and tanja  armin and tanja from germany were driving their 2004 mitsubishi camper through tanzania as part of a planned twoyear trip through the balkans africa and south america when the pandemic struck initially hoping to stick it out they eventually decided to take one of the last repatriation flights out  we found a place to store the car safely on private ground if we hadnt have found that place we definitely would not have left our camper behind says armin  their carnet de passage  a type of vehicle permit that has a cash deposit related to the value of the car  will expire in june attempts to arrange special dispensation with the customs authorities before they left were unsuccessful and they have so far been unable to get hold of the right people in tanzania to help them  image copyright armin and tanja  the penalty for an expired carnet in tanzania would be €1400 in our case as it is 20 of the carnet car value we are lucky that we have quite an old car but still we hope to get out of this without paying we will ask for a flexible solution says armin  the delay has caused them to cut out the south america leg of their world trip but they hope to return to africa by september  read radka and ivars blog here  you may also be interested in  image copyright gunther holtorf  how a man met a woman and they set off on a journey across six

were driving through indias winding empty highways to see their newborn child  it was the middle of april and the country was in the throes of the worlds harshest lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus almost everything was shut  at checkpoints policemen halted the couple examined their papers and asked why they were on the road  we are going to see our firstborn infant they replied  the policemen looked incredulous staring at the woman in the vehicle  what do you mean you are going to see your newborn where is the baby they would say eyes searching the insides of the suv  the couple would explain their daughter had been born more than a week ago to a surrogate mother in anand a city in the western indian state of gujarat better known as the countrys milk capital and that they were travelling from their home city of bangalore some 1600km 994 miles away in south india to take her home  still there was a lot of confusion but in the end they would check our papers and allow us to proceed rakesh name changed the father of the child told me  their child was one of dozens of surrogate babies stranded in clinics across india because of the lockdown she was among one of 28 babies born at anands akanksha hospital and research institute since late march when the lockdown was imposed more than 50 days later at least 10 babies were still waiting for their parents to arrive  image copyright getty images  surrogacy hub  india has a thriving commercial surrogacy industry and an estimated 1500 surrogate babies are born every year  the country has been often called the surrogacy hub of the world where infertile couples including many from overseas pay local women to carry their embryos through to birth  but there have been growing concerns over the unregulated business  in 2018 india unveiled a draft law which would ban commercial surrogacy infertile couples would be able to seek a surrogate who had to be a relative the law is awaiting parliamentary

had met the potential surrogate mother a thirtysomething woman with two children of her own at the gujarat clinic  she was born on 6 april a healthy 29kg baby her parents were stuck at the other end of the country they looked at the pictures and mobile phone videos of the baby girl sent by the clinic in one she is responding to sound and light in another shes being fed formula they called her a bundle of joy  it took some time to sink in and then my wife began to cry it was an emotional moment but little did we know our travails were about to begin rakesh told me  image copyright getty

more than a dozen officials to get passes many didnt quite understand the urgency  oh your wife has delivered in gujarat and you want to join them one official told them  your wife is here and someone else is pregnant why dont you ask her to come here another official wondered  yet another official asked this is a test tube baby right so whats the urgency baby can remain there right  what is the emergency here  the doctor from the gujarat clinic finally rushed an email to authorities explaining why parents needed to pick up their surrogate child urgently this is an unique situation we are not being able to hand over the babies to parents in time we are stressed dr nayna patel head of the clinic told me and there are 39 surrogate mothers pregnant at the clinic  on the evening of 14 april

the airconditioning on for 30 minutes roll down the windows and let fresh air in for an hour before switching on the air conditioning again  for the next two days and nights they drove along the sullen highways they stopped at filling stations when night fell there they would fill diesel charge their mobile phones and have dinner they had packed enough cooked food 10 litres of water and biscuits jam and bread for the journey after dinner the driver would sleep for three hours  it was getting hotter and hotter we didnt sleep at all rakesh said i lost count of the checkpoints but after

temperature checked register all our details try to answer puzzling questions on the baby and then proceed  but a couple of hours away from anand they arrived at what turned out to be the last checkpoint before entering the city  the policemen there had stopped all traffic saying he wouldnt allow them to enter the city as the number of infections in gujarat were rising rapidly and there were severe restrictions on outsiders the state has reported some 14000 covid19 cases and more than 850 deaths so far  tensions ran high commuters in half a dozen stranded cars with passes were

hospital where they lived in a room for nearly a week  on 1 may their quarantine ended and they were able to see their baby more than three weeks after she was born  rakesh and anita showered

233,dominic cummings who is boris johnsons senior adviser,image copyright reuters  dominic cummings is more than just a runofthemill adviser to prime minister boris johnson  in many ways the governments agenda has been forged by his ideas and mr johnson has relied heavily on his strategic insights into the mood of voters gathered from focus groups  it was mr cummings who devised the high risk strategy of pushing for an election last year to be fought on a get brexit done ticket focussing on winning seats in labour heartlands something no previous tory leader had managed to do in decades  it paid off in spades just as the take back control message he devised as mastermind of the 2016 vote leave campaign helped win the brexit referendum  although very different in character  mr johnson likes to be popular mr cummings seems to actively court unpopularity  the two men formed a strong bond during the referendum campaign  it still surprised some when mr cummings was brought in to the heart of government as mr johnsons chief adviser when he became pm given his past record of rubbing senior tory politicians up the wrong way  his abrasive style and uncompromising attitude towards those he regards as lazy or intellectually inferior which would include most mps have made him few friends at westminster  the team around him at downing street some of whom are vote leave veterans are fiercely loyal to mr cummings and share with him a sense that they are outsiders battling an entrenched elite  he is close to cabinet office minister michael gove for whom he served as an adviser during mr goves time as education secretary and the two are working on farreaching plans to rewire the government machine  the levelling up agenda  moving power and money out of london and the southeast  is also a cummings project as are plans in the tory manifesto to spend more on scientific research and make better use of data  for these reasons losing him as an adviser and an ally would be a severe blow to mr johnson and would help explain his determination to hold on to him amid mounting pressure to cut him loose  mr cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the conservative party for nearly two decades and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and trying to upset the established order  he has never been a member of the conservative party and has little time for what he sees as some of the timeservers and publicity addicts that populate the commons benches  he has a similarly dismissive attitude to the media or at least those whose job it is to doorstep people outside their homes  in may 2020 he came under attack  including from some conservative mps  over allegations he breached lockdown rules implemented to stop the spread of coronavirus he denied any wrongdoing and said he had not considered resigning  responding to a wave of criticism from the press as well as members of the public mr cummings denied he was looking for loopholes in the lockdown regulations to excuse his actions  i was looking to try and do the best that i could in a complex situation he added the way that i dealt with it was the least risk to everybody concerned  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption how powerful is dominic cummings  a longstanding eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the antieuro business for sterling group mr cummingss other passion is changing the way government operates  he grabbed headlines in january when he posted an advert on his personal blog for weirdos and misfits with odd skills to work in government  the career civil servants and public school bluffers in whitehall are singularly illequipped to take decisions about complex issues he has argued at great length on his blog  instead he believes mathematicians and data scientists should be given a far bigger role  and he has made an effort to educate himself in these fields  it has been reported his whatsapp profile listed his priorities as get brexit done then arpa  this is a reference to the advanced research projects agency set up by the us in 1958 that led to the creation of silicon valley  image copyright afp image caption the vote leave bus was one of its most notable campaign tactics  mr cummings is a native of durham in the northeast of england his father robert was an oil rig engineer and his mother morag a teacher and behavioural specialist  he went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at durham school he graduated from oxford university with a firstclass degree in modern history and spent some time in russia where he was involved with an illfated attempt to launch an airline among other projects  after a stint as campaign director for business for sterling he spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then conservative leader iain duncan smith  he played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native north east  in what turned out to be a dry run for the brexit campaign the north east says no team won the referendum with a mix of eyecatching stunts  including an inflatable white elephant  and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing antipolitics mood among the public  he is then said to have retreated to his fathers farm in county durham where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world  image copyright channel 4house productions image caption benedict cumberbatch was widely praised for his portrayal of dominic cummings in brexit the uncivil war  he reemerged in 2007 as a special adviser to michael gove who became education secretary from 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit the pair would rail against what they called the blob  the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers unions that sought in his opinion to frustrate his attempts at reform  he left of his own accord to set up a free school having rubbed a number of people in the ministry and in the conservative party up the wrong way  he once described brexit secretary david davis as thick as mince and as lazy as a toad and so irritated david cameron the former prime minister who called him a career psychopath  his appointment as head of the vote leave campaign  dramatised last year in channel 4 drama brexit the uncivil war  was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy  vote leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the electoral commission and mr cummings was held in contempt of parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the culture media and sport select committee  image copyright epa image caption mr cummings facing questions from the media outside his home  on the few occasions he has been scrutinised by mps there have often been rhetorical fireworks and bad blood on both sides  mr cummings who is married to spectator writer mary wakefield has since criticised the failure of mps to devise a plan for brexit and believes the government should have waited longer to trigger article 50  on becoming prime minister mr johnson hired his former vote leave colleague to be his senior adviser  a job which involved trying to get a brexit deal through parliament a deal was eventually passed in january once the prime minister secured a strong majority in the 2019 election  mr cummings has hinted in blog posts that he does not want to spend too long in his current role at no 10 but he has given no sign he is planning to leave any time soon  in may 2020 some conservative mps called for his resignation after it emerged he had travelled from london to durham with his family during the lockdown when his wife had coronavirus symptoms  he was emphatically defended by the prime minister who insisted he had acted reasonably and legally  when the criticism refused to go away mr cummings held an unprecedented press conference in downing street garden to explain the reasons why he chose to travel to his parents farm in march  at a time when he believed both he and his wife were about to be laid low with the virus  in order to guarantee his fouryearold sons safety  i dont regret what i did he told journalists the situation i was in

235,coronavirus baffling observations from the front line,when you talk to intensive care doctors across the uk exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of covid19 the phrase that emerges time after time is weve never seen anything like this before  they knew a new disease was coming and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in china at the end of last year  and as the number of cases increased doctors up and down the uk were reading firsthand accounts from colleagues in china and then in italy  in scientific journals and on social media  about the intensity of infection  it felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the dday landings says barbara miles clinical director of intensive care at glasgow royal infirmary with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing  but what arrived in the uk as winter turned into spring took even the most experienced icu specialists by surprise  most people infected with the coronavirus have only mild symptoms or sometimes none at all but in many thousands of patients who fall critically ill covid19 is a disease of alarming complexity  what follows is a summary often in their own words of what doctors have learnt about how covid19 attacks the human body and what they still need to know  more than viral pneumonia  i think most clinicians were expecting a respiratory virus that causes pneumonia says prof anthony gordon a consultant on the intensive care unit at st marys hospital paddington something similar to diseases like seasonal flu on a much bigger scale  but he says it became apparent very quickly that it was affecting far more than just peoples breathing  viral pneumonia is a nasty disease  a serious infection of the lungs which causes inflammation as the body fights against it  but the worst cases of covid19 have been something new  the volume of this is of course unprecedented in the era of modern medicine says ron daniels an intensive care consultant at hospitals in birmingham  but its also the type of illness which is so distinct and the way its really different from almost every other patient that weve ever seen before  image copyright science photo library image caption scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia  for the critically ill this is a disease of such severe inflammation and blood clotting that it attacks multiple organs and causes lifethreatening problems that cascade around the body  as a doctor it seems at times quite horrific we have had so many very very sick patients who are having these profound changes in their body en masse says beverley hunt a professor of thrombosis  the clotting of the blood  who works in intensive care at a leading london hospital  were all struggling to understand it better and its absolutely key that we get more research done so we can understand what is going on  oxygen  as the virus began to spread more rapidly in the uk throughout march patients started arriving in hospitals because they were breathless and short of oxygen but many of the most seriously ill  such as those who were admitted to intensive care  often had problems with other organs not just their lungs and their blood was acting in ways that have yet to be fully explained  we still dont really know why some patients feel ok to begin with even though they have incredibly low levels of oxygen in their blood says prof hugh montgomery a consultant in critical care at the whittington hospital in north london  doctors measure what they call oxygen saturation  the percentage of haemoglobin molecules in the blood that are carrying oxygen usually the aim with patients who are unwell is to keep it at 90 or above but in some covid19 patients the levels drop quite a lot further down to 80 and sometimes considerably lower than that  normally that is enough to set serious alarm bells ringing but a number of patients appeared to be functioning relatively well with remarkably low levels of oxygen it may be related to the inflammation which is affecting the blood vessels says anthony gordon its stopping the oxygen getting into the blood and thats whats leading to the low levels but the lungs themselves are not so affected in the early stages  image copyright getty images  it is one of the many mysteries of covid19 on which more research is urgently required and its led many doctors to question whether mechanical ventilation to help patients breathe is always the right course of action for this disease to be connected to a ventilator a patient has to be rendered unconscious and a tube has to be inserted into their main airway this process has saved many seriously ill covid19 patients  but for some the focus on the lungs may have been the wrong treatment at the wrong time  the disease appears to go through different stages notes barbara miles and so knowing more about how to use the breathing machines on these patients at different stages of the illness would be something i hope we will learn as time goes on  normally patients who are seriously ill with viral pneumonia have to be on a ventilator for about a week with covid19 a week is often not enough weve been seeing people on a ventilator for much longer than that and we dont quite understand why that is observes prof danny mcauley an icu consultant at the royal victoria hospital in belfast  it may be that there is still untreated virus continuing to cause damage or it may be that its a response to the virus with all the excessive inflammation causing multiple problems in the body and many of those problems appear to be connected to the blood  inflammation and blood clots  everyone agrees that unprecedented levels of inflammation in the lungs make this a very different disease when the lining of blood vessels gets inflamed the blood is more likely to clot and covid19 creates incredibly thick sticky blood in seriously ill patients  we find small clots in the small arteries of the lungs but also big clots in the big arteries of the lungs says hugh montgomery more than 25 of patients have significant clots and this is a real problem and the stickier the blood the bigger the problem  youre much more prone to having deep vein thrombosis explains beverley hunt which usually means a blood clot in your leg and pulmonary embolism when one of the deep vein thromboses travels around the body and blocks the blood supply to the lungs adding to the problem of the pneumonia  coronavirus in the uk  31 december  world health organisation first informed by china of pneumonia of unknown cause   world health organisation first informed by china of 31 january  first positive cases of coronavirus infection announced in the uk   of coronavirus infection announced in the 2 march  first known coronavirus death in the uk according to nhs england   first known in the uk according to nhs england 23 march  government imposes lockdown across the country   government imposes across the country 2 april  suspected covid19 hospital admissions peak in uk at more than 3400 in a single day   suspected covid19 hospital in uk at more than 3400 in a single day 10 april  980 deaths announced in the uk the highest daily figur e involving confirmed covid19 cases   980 deaths announced in the uk the e involving confirmed covid19 cases 20 may 250908 positive covid19 cases and 36042 deaths of positive cases across the uk so far  blood clots also prevent proper circulation of the blood to other organs like the heart and the brain making it far more likely that seriously ill covid19 patients could suffer a heart attack or a stroke and some of the warning signs about blood clotting have astonished doctors  the main protein in the blood which forms blood clots is called fibrinogen  normally says beverley hunt its somewhere between two and four grams per litre in your blood it goes up a bit in pregnancy but what were getting with covid is as high as 10 to 14 grams per litre ive never seen that in all my years as a doctor  another measure of the risk of clotting a blood protein known as ddimer has also been off the scale in a healthy patient levels are measured in the tens or hundreds says hugh montgomery with covid its not been at all unusual to be seeing levels of 60 70 or 80000 which is quite unheard of  immune system and other organs  in some cases such extraordinary numbers must be due to the presence of multiple clots but ddimers can also be a marker of an infection so severe that it triggers a lethal overreaction from the bodys immune system  cytokines are small molecules produced by the body as part of its defence against infection a chemical warning system they lead to inflammation and up to a certain level that is good for you it allows you to fight an infection and hopefully get rid of it  but in some patients covid19 provokes what is known as a cytokine storm  the problem says anthony gordon is that if the infection overwhelms the response you get a massive release of these inflammatory markers they then cause even more excessive inflammation which leads not just to the breathing problems weve talked about but damage to the bodys other organs  one focus of study in seriously ill patients is that the number of tcells  important blood cells in the immune system  appears to be lowered dramatically during the cytokine storm researchers hope that boosting tcell numbers will aid recovery  image copyright getty images  but all of these factors add up to covid19 being highly unpredictable  it is what specialists call a multisystem disease that makes it much harder to know how best to treat any individual patient and at the moment there is no textbook to tell doctors what to do  its not just the lungs being affected says hugh montgomery its the kidneys the heart the liver weve also seen severely inflamed muscle which is doing a lot of damage more than 2000 covid patients admitted to intensive care have suffered kidney failure  weve been giving patients dialysis machine support says barbara miles but the blood flowing through the machines clots far more readily than were used to so weve had to give them increased amounts of blood thinning medication as well  in a growing number of patients the brain has also become a serious cause for concern among senior doctors whove been exchanging information on a daily basis for weeks we now know that large numbers of patients are having significant inflammation of the brain observes hugh montgomery  the inflammation presents with everything from delirium and confusion even more than we would normally expect in icu to fits and what we call diffuse encephalitis  that means some people not waking up properly after being taken off a ventilator  it is a litany of challenges and doctors are desperate to know exactly why and how all these different parts of the body are being so badly affected  lack of oxygen and damaged blood vessels are clearly part of the equation but evidence is mounting that many organs are being attacked by the virus directly and it is striking that the most common underlying conditions involved with covid19 are not respiratory problems like asthma  instead they are vascular conditions that affect the veins and the arteries  high blood pressure diabetes and heart disease along with associated factors such as gender obesity and in particular old age  according to the intensive care national audit and research centre more than 70 of patients admitted to critical care units in england wales and northern ireland have been male and more than 70 have been overweight or obese  more than two thirds of those who have died in intensive care have been over the age of 60  some people and not others  but that still doesnt entirely explain why so many people infected with this coronavirus have only mild symptoms or even no symptoms at all while others become dangerously ill very quickly  weve yet to fully understand this condition it is baffling admits ron daniels pointing out that even in intensive care patients present in a variety of different ways we can have a patient in their 70s who has isolated respiratory failure and just needs a bit of help with a ventilator and we can have a patient in their 20s who develops multiorgan failure very quickly  in the absence of solid proof many theories are being discussed based on observation of patients and much research is being done many icu doctors think it is highly likely that genetics plays a part in some people becoming critically ill with covid19 but they cant yet say for sure  it could be partly responsible for the disproportionate effect it has had on people of african and asian origin says ron daniels it may also be responsible for the differences in the response of individuals  it is possible for example that the genetic variation that makes you more susceptible to getting high blood pressure or diabetes also makes you more susceptible to the virus  image copyright getty images  one leading theory focuses on ace2 a protein which sits on the surface of many types of cells and helps regulate blood pressure it is ace2 that the coronavirus uses to enter the body and infect healthy cells some people may be genetically predisposed to having more ace2 receptors in their body and may therefore be more likely to fall seriously ill with covid19  further evidence to support this theory can be found in the number of seriously ill patients who develop gut problems which suggests the virus can also attack the lower digestive tract where there are plenty of ace2 receptors it looks likely that ace2 is also responsible for the high incidence of kidney failure  for now though there are as many questions as answers  barbara miles says dealing with covid19 has been the steepest learning curve of her career wed like to know more about how to treat and prevent blood clots in these patients  whats the optimum treatment to try to prevent them and the optimum treatment if they occur she says  getting the right balance between different kinds of drugs is absolutely vital  trying to solve one problem can sometimes create another we dont really know exactly how much therapy to give and for how long to give it but that will hopefully come as we gain more experience of this condition  trials  similar responses emerge to a series of questions that icu consultants have been grappling with even as the number of patients in intensive care has fallen again  when is the right time to mechanically ventilate patients with covid19  what might be the best antiviral drugs to use and what might be the right dose of antiinflammatory or immunesuppressing drugs to prescribe  could the idea of using convalescent plasma  antibodies from the blood of patients who have recovered  be part of the solution  weve multiple anecdotal reports that say this works or that works says danny mcauley and really the only way to know the correct answer to this new disease is to do large clinical trials over the next few months a huge number of such trials are already taking place  there are 41 nationally prioritised studies being funded in the uk alone  as doctors prepare for the possibility of the virus returning in a second surge  there is frustration in some quarters that trials arent being approved quickly enough but the uk is a world leader in medical research and the more doctors know the better they can treat covid19  they know the failure of lungs has certainly been the biggest cause of covid deaths in intensive care but it is not the only one that means what has been done in the past may not always be the right thing to do for this particular illness  its been almost medieval says beverley hunt as she describes the challenges of the past three months the best icu doctors in the land have had to make educated guesses about a disease they have never encountered before for much of the time they have had to base their medicine on observation rather than on knowledge gained from previous experiments and existing data  and one of the greatest clinical challenges in dealing with covid19 in the future is to improve the outcome for patients admitted to intensive care  weve learnt an awful lot and the teamwork has been amazing but ive struggled says anthony gordon who has worked on intensive care wards for more than 20 years at times ive come home thinking i really dont know if what i did today was the right thing  were having to learn in a few months what weve learnt over many hundreds of years for other diseases and that has been a real challenge  additional reporting oliver

236,dominic cummings and the battle for downing street,for someone who regards himself as a disruptive outsider dominic cummings has never felt the need to please anyone and so boris johnson had his work cut out when he asked cummings to join him in downing street last july the new prime minister described it as a “hairy” mission  one friend recalls “boris was really turning the thumbscrews on dom saying ‘you’ve got to come in you’ve got to come in’”  cummings tabled what he called a series of “terrorist demands” to the incoming prime minister after judging according to one friend that his team had monumentally failed to draw up a coherent plan  the boldest demand which was at the centre of the eventual showdown with sajid javid was to be given control of the network of special advisers the political appointees who work for cabinet ministers by controlling the special advisers cummings would gain significant leverage over cabinet ministers  to his surprise the new prime minister said yes to his demands cummings therefore entered downing street with one immediate plan  to sort out the “mess” of brexit  and a longer vision to transform the workings of government  “we are going to bulldoze our way to make sure brexit happens” was the cummings view at the time “it has to happen”  in a fraught autumn for the tory party which saw the evisceration of the proeuropean wing of the party cummings deployed his own powers sometimes without mercy  relations started to sour with javid when his special adviser sonia khan was unceremoniously and highly controversially marched out of no 10 last august after falling out with cummings the sacking of khan  who was escorted out of downing street by an armed police officer  chilled the atmosphere in whitehall javid was not even aware it was happening  cummings is not the loner he is sometimes portrayed as and knows power when he sees it on the day johnson became prime minister a scruffylooking cummings made sure to frame himself in the corner of a photo taken as the cabinet secretary and the man in charge of the civil service sir mark sedwill welcomed the new pm to no 10 sedwill could well be seen as the epitome of the sort of generalist  a career flitting between the foreign office and the home office  scorned by cummings  but gisela stuart the former labour minister who chaired the vote leave campaign who knows both men well says “i remember looking at that picture and i thought sedwill and dom have a lot in common both of them are big picture people both of them are deeply strategic both of them are terribly focused i think they want the same thing”  with the fate of brexit unknown in a hung parliament cummings advised johnson to take a risky gamble by going for an early general election  cummings is widely praised for pushing for it but was blunt about the dangers at the time “this election is very risky very risky for us” he was heard to say “anyone who says they know what is going to happen or thinks we will walk it is an idiot”  the electoral gamble paid off but cummings was unhappy – feeling that his control of special advisers had failed to impose enough discipline he was highly suspicious of the team working for javid cummings had technically taken control of the network of special advisers but they were still in effect answerable to their cabinet minister and not to him  also cummings wanted to inject new characters into the machinery of government he used a blog on 2 january to call on “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to join him in delivering the large changes in policy and decisionmaking he said were required by brexit  cummings indicated that 35000 people had answered his call they must have been attracted by the job specification in which he wrote “i don’t want confident public school bluffers i want people who are much brighter than me who can work in an extreme environment if you play office politics you will be discovered and immediately binned”  but cummings faced a rebuke from a writer cited in one of his blogs william gibson mocked cummings for appearing to liken himself to the “quasi evil genius” hubertus bigend in his novel pattern recognition “the idea of people like that being made bureaucrats is quite unnerving” gibson told the bbc  a former cabinet minister accuses cummings of ruthless tactics which have involved injecting populism into the political discourse and undermining the constitution when parliament was suspended last year david gauke who stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate in the election after he was deprived of the tory whip says “you can admire the ruthless determination to pursue a strategy which very few people would do in as determined a manner as he has done but it is a strategy which is reckless and damaging for the country in the undermining of institutions”  but the former mp sir nicholas soames who lost the tory whip at the same time as gauke admires cummings soames who eventually had the whip restored says “dominic cummings is an exceptionally gifted and clever man every government needs a disruptor governments that don’t have disruptors become complacent and run out of steam the predictable pretend loathing of cummings is totally pathetic”  but cummings has made enemies in a potentially significant camp  friends of sajid javid “the handling of sajid was gratuitous” one said “is it really wise to create a prince across the water so early on”  friends of cummings are divided on what the future holds for him as he lives with the inevitable compromises of government one says he is a pragmatist  but another says that cummings’s irritation with david cameron’s vetoing of his plan to scrap gcses shows he is prepared to walk “dom is not there to please he’s there to get stuff done if the principal boris doesn’t follow that plan he will say ‘you’re not interested in taking my advice i’m out of here’”  a divisive polemicist both charming and abrasive dominic cummings is wielding immense power in the name of a prime minister with an historic mandate it is a natural meeting of minds between two idiosyncratic political beasts with eclectic interests in the classical world and beyond  johnson summoned cummings in his first hour of need when brexit and the future of the conservative party were in jeopardy cummings was the right fit for the first phase of boris johnson in no 10 it will be a cliffhanger to see how long the match lasts
237,coronavirus the bolivian orchestra stranded in a german castle,image copyright ariel laura  the sound of panpipes flutes and snare drums fills the rehearsal space of the orquesta experimental de instrumentos nativos  the breathing techniques required to play these instruments for a few hours put you in a kind of trance says miguel cordoba who plays the siku flute  but as soon as the rehearsal finishes they are all too aware of how their life has changed because they are not rehearsing back home in la paz bolivia but in the shadow of a german castle where they have been stranded for 73 days  the musicians most of whom have never left bolivia before were expecting to spend just over a fortnight this spring touring east germanys concert halls  instead they are holed up in the buildings and grounds of the sprawling estate of rheinsberg palace a moated castle which has been home to generations of german royalty and aristocracy an hour and a halfs drive northwest of berlin  image copyright getty images  as the musicians some of whom are as young as 17 touched down in germany on 10 march for their tour news broke that berlin had become the seventh german region to impose a ban on gatherings of 1000 people or more in response to the coronavirus pandemic  our bus broke down on the motorway i remember joking that this was bad luck and perhaps our concerts would be cancelled recollects carlos but never did i think it would actually happen  their three planned performances were cancelled in the days that followed and as bolivias government announced it would close its borders the orchestra scrambled to get home but failed  germanys ban on mass gatherings was swiftly followed by a full lockdown meaning the musicians are only allowed to roam as far as the forest that lines the perimeter of the estate  so their free time is spent rehearsing in the nearly 600yearold palace grounds and exploring the surrounding woodland home to 23 packs of wolves  only on monday did they get the chance to step inside the castle for the first time as tours for the public reopened  its very different to my home its very beautiful says 25yearold miguel  image copyright ariel laura image caption rehearsing in the guest house of rheinsberg palace  there are worse places to be trapped when i wake up i watch the sun rise over the forest and the lake back home i only hear the sound of traffic  but despite the picturesque natural surroundings the musicians are worried they have been forgotten  we feel abandoned says carlos whos spent several thankless hours on the phone to the bolivian embassy trying to find a way to get home  the group had only been in germany for a week when bolivias president announced the countrys border was set to close within days and all international flights had been suspended  arrangements were swiftly made by the german foreign office and bolivian embassy to reserve seats on one of the last flights out of germany to south america landing in lima peru  the group was initially relieved  when we were on the way to the airport we were all in good spirits laughing and chatting says camed martela 20  but then carlos received a call to say the flight had been cancelled as the plane was not allowed to land in peru  the mood suddenly became sombre  everyone on the bus went quiet he says  from that moment the 6000 miles 9656km between germany and bolivia seemed further than ever  tracy prado who only joined the orchestra in december remembers thinking about her daughters 11th birthday which was coming up a few weeks later  i had got my hopes up and it was devastating to think i would miss this important day she says  image copyright ariel laura  the group decided the only way to cope was to put together a strict practice schedule  three hours before lunch three hours after experimenting with a fusion of traditional andean music and more contemporary genres  indigenous music is all about the principle of community  everybody can take something from what they are and offer it to the group says carlos  you feel the same as your ancestors felt when playing these traditional instruments which is a beautiful thing adds miguel whose roots stretch back to bolivias kallawaya people known for their musical healing ceremonies  some members of the orchestra speak to their families in bolivia for others communication is near impossible as internet and telephone signals are patchy outside bolivias main cities  many of the musicians play a major role in providing for their families financially and being unable to do this at the moment is exacerbating their anxiety  in an interview with bolivias flagship station radio panamericana foreign minister karen longaric was asked for her response to the orchestras case after a distraught mother of one of the musicians called in  longaric suggested the orchestra left knowing the borders were set to soon close although bolivia had not recorded a single coronavirus case on the day they left  she also said the governments priorities were elsewhere  repatriating the most vulnerable  women children sick people and the elderly  image copyright ariel laura  carlos says there seems to be little sympathy for the orchestra back in bolivia  people back home think were in a fairytale land he says rolling his eyes ive had hundreds of messages telling me to stop complaining and that im living like a princess in a german castle  camed is disappointed they have not been able to perform as planned  wed been preparing since january so i became quite depressed as i watched everything wed prepared for get taken away like this  the orchestra helped me get back on track after the death of my dad my family were so proud of me when they heard i was flying to europe to perform my countrys music  the town of just over 8000 people also called rheinsberg has largely been welcoming towards the bolivian visitors if a little bemused by their presence  when i leave the hostel alone i do feel a little selfconscious camed says sometimes i get strange looks and people stop and stare  some go further than a raised eyebrow perhaps confused by the fact that the musicians appear to be flouting germanys social distancing rules as it may not be immediately obvious that they have been allowed to classify themselves as a family unit  image copyright ariel laura  he says on one of the occasions the bolivians played a game of football on the meadow directly in front of the castle they soon found themselves surrounded by six police officers in full riot gear just short of a helmet says timo kreuser one of three german musicians who helped facilitate the tour and are staying with them  they came from from left and right and started to encircle us and things got a little tense recalls miguel  in the end they just told us that we couldnt congregate in such a large group but it wasnt too serious  the police are used to it now so they just phone me and its always resolved says timo  timo has been keen to help the musicians partly to repay the favour of their own hospitality when he was with them in la paz in october violent protests led to the resignation of the president and carlos and the orchestra helped timo evacuate to peru  generosity and offers of help have been in plentiful supply from most people  the kitchen staff at the guest house the musicians are living in come in to work wearing masks and maintain a distance from their bolivian guests  we are so grateful for the food and the roofs over our heads says tracy who speculates shes one of only a few in the group who enjoy the local delicacies  and of course they have the woodland to explore tracy says she spotted three wolves while out walking recently  i froze in fear but they were just play fighting and moved on  it is not just wolves they look out for  one of the palaces former inhabitants was frederick the great who was given ownership of the estate by his father in 1736 before he ascended to the throne and described his time at rheinsberg as his happiest years  image copyright getty images image caption the musicians are very aware of the palaces previous inhabitants including frederick the great  a close friend of frederick reflecting on his impressions of rheinsberg wrote the evenings are dedicated to music the prince has concerts in his salon where noone is admitted unless called one of those who performed was reportedly jc bach  we all joke that fredericks ghost is following us and trying to trip us up says camed i dont usually believe in such things but it does feel as if there are ghosts on the grounds  as the seasons shifted from early spring to summer the musicians heavy clothes packed in anticipation of colder weather were too warm for their long walks around the estate  but a concerned bolivian expat in hamburg has helped out on this front  she collected mountains of clothes and sent them to us we have seven big boxes so far  perhaps too many we may need to return some or pass them onto someone else in need says carlos  but despite the generosity and good will the orchestra worries that its stay cannot be bankrolled forever  accommodation costs are mounting to more than €35000 38400 a month alone says berno odo polzer the director of maerzmusik the festival at which the orchestra were set to perform it is one of several publicly funded arts programmes which has supported the orchestras longer than expected stay  germany is allowing international flights again but bolivias borders remain shut for the foreseeable future  the bolivian embassy told the bbc it is trying to get the orchestra on a flight to bolivia in early june out of madrid  but carlos is worried about how things will be once they return too  covid is getting very political back home says carlos  the bolivian government delayed the presidential election that was due in march and later tried and failed to force through a decree limiting freedom of expression and criticisms over the handling of the coronavirus crisis  im dreaming of the day i will be at my bed in bolivia and say ok this is over but i also know that on that day i will start missing what is happening here admits carlos  all images subject to copyright
238,i left my campervan in argentina,image copyright radka and ivar  imagine breaking free you sell your possessions buy a van pack it with what you need and go for months or years you live a frugal life going wherever you want but for thousands who made this dream a reality coronavirus brought them to a sudden halt writes paula dear and left them stranded with a van and a vanload of kit on the far side of the world  for radka and ivar the plan began to form when they met in 2016 both working as personal carers for a disabled man in trondheim central norway they would cross paths as she finished the night shift and he took over for the day  we met for like five minutes to change the shift i was very charming in the morning jokes radka  and then you would stay for breakfast sometimes ivar adds  radka was the more experienced traveller she had previously hitchhiked from russia to southeast asia and was preparing to do the same from argentina to alaska but after falling in love with ivar who was in the process of retraining as a nurse she faced a dilemma  there were lots of conversations i said you have to promise me that once youre done studying youll go with me it was a dealbreaker and ivar adopted my dream very quickly she says  in the meantime radka took a sixweek trip to patagonia with a friend and at one point hitched a lift with a woman called silvia from ushuaia in argentina the worlds southernmost city they stayed in touch and three years later this would turn out to be a critical stroke of luck  radka and ivars plan slowly morphed from backpacking to travelling the americas by van and they picked up a secondhand toyota hiace with help from radkas dad they built a basic bed and kitchen in the back and storage for their gear  including climbing and freediving equipment bicycles and an inflatable canoe  we needed a van because ivar has a shedload of sports stuff says radka but also its the freedom of it when we are inside the van with gas for two months and food for several weeks we can be totally off grid we thought it would be great to have comfort and the ability to drive wherever we want  image copyright radka and ivar  ivar whod previously been a climbing instructor studied hard for his nursing degree and they worked every single job that came our way to save money says radka who would often finish a nightshift and go on to do cleaning jobs before having four hours off ahead of the next nightshift  she developed terrible sleeping problems she says i burnt out and made myself ill but i did it because i had a dream and i wanted to make it come true  in the flurry of preparations they were still making lastminute modifications to the van on the day they drove it to the port in germany for its voyage across the atlantic and through the panama canal to chile  six weeks later in early january they were in san antonio to collect it and begin their epic journey it was the height of summer and their plan was to loop down at a leisurely pace to the southern tip of argentina  the symbolic start of their onetotwo year trip  and then drive north all the way to alaska  so stopping frequently they slowly headed south enjoying hikes in the chilean island of chiloé and argentinian trekking hub of el chaltén and a trip to the 5kmwide perito moreno glacier camping out in nature soon started to smooth out radkas erratic sleeping patterns  el chaltén was absolutely amazing says radka who had long fantasised about photographing the famous fiery reds and burnt oranges and yellows of the patagonian autumn which by this time was already beginning  but the weather forecast was bad so we said lets go to ushuaia and when we come back this way its going to be even nicer colours ivar says  by this stage they were hearing reports of covid lockdowns in europe but were reassured by friends in argentina and chile that similar moves seemed unlikely there  we were discussing whether we should go to ushuaia or not because its locked in with a chilean part above it but there really wasnt any news and when we asked people they said it was just recommended to wash your hands no more so we decided to go and then it all happened really quickly and we couldnt get back out says ivar  image copyright radka and ivar  hours after they arrived on 15 march the borders unexpectedly closed trapping them on the argentinian side of tierra del fuego island which can only be exited via a chilean ferry  with people being ordered to stay at home or in hotels they decided to drive out of the city and wait out the initial 14day lockdown in their van as camping was banned they had to conceal their plans from the police when they encountered a checkpoint at the edge of ushuaia an hour north at a forest lake called laguna margarita they found a spot to wildcamp  we were afraid someone would see us and report us but we were really deep in the woods and nobody came says ivar  when the weather allowed they paddled on the lake or went running ivar taught radka how to ropeclimb in the trees it was tough going at times too the wind and rain often forced them inside and there wasnt enough sun to replenish their solargenerated electricity on day two they ran out of cooking gas and they were washing in nearfreezing water  but they werent too worried once the twoweek confinement was over they would return to el chaltén and wait out the crisis  they could happily spend months hiking in the national parks mountains the lack of gas however forced them to drive back towards ushuaia and when they picked up a phone signal again it became obvious the crisis was deepening national parks had closed they read increasingly desperate reports from fellow nomads on facebook forums  moreover they were really afraid they would get into trouble from the police for camping in the car during lockdown we didnt know how to explain where wed been for those two weeks or where we were going says radka she messaged silvia the woman who had given her a ride in 2016 could she vouch for them or provide an address  en route back to ushuaia they hit a police checkpoint  they were filming us and the car asking where we had been where we were going we tried to tell them wed been camping but we dont speak good spanish im not sure they understood says ivar  we were so stressed we then took off in the wrong direction when we turned back we were met by two police cars with sirens  the officers werent pleased  they said they would escort us to our hostel in ushuaia they didnt realise we didnt have one  on the way radka tried silvia again and luckily she responded within the halfhour drive she had secured them a friends rental apartment and they were escorted right to the door by the police  image copyright radka and ivar  two weeks of lockdown in the apartment followed it was much like those seen elsewhere with trips to the supermarket or pharmacy allowed and little else  for the first few days we felt ok bingewatching tv series enjoying hot showers but we started to realise this was not going to be a situation for a couple of weeks and that we really couldnt afford to pay for accommodation for up to six months because even if they then opened the borders wed be out of money we were quickly getting more and more tired and depressed and i started having problems sleeping again says radka tearfully  when you are at home i imagine you find things to keep yourself busy  clean or paint or bake whatever but being in a foreign flat in a foreign country where you were not planning to stay its maybe different says radka you cant focus on doing something new you spend your day researching every desperate possibility to get out of there we were even looking at whether it was possible to sail across the ocean and when each one is a dead end it feels like such a waste of energy and motivation  ivar adds its like waiting in a bus stop when you dont know exactly when youre going to leave and its not the place you want to be  but the decision to leave wasnt straightforward it slowly crept up on them says ivar it kind of evolved from possibly going home because its going to be boring to wait to realising if we stay three of four more months our wellbeing might suffer  when radka received an sms from the embassy to say there were repatriation flights from the capital buenos aires she felt an irresistible pull homewards  i felt a bit like a failure when i started to consider going back we have friends who are staying it was like we were giving up but everybodys situation is different  radka and ivar are part of a sizeable community of people who travel and live in vehicles for months or years at a time  sometimes permanently  and are known as overlanders or vanlifers some work as they go along or stop for a while to volunteer others have already retired ask them to stayathome and well it can be a bit complicated where  you might think that as they are equipped to live offgrid they would be fine during lockdown in reality their lifestyle choice depends on the ability to move around camp and access services like water power gas and toilets with regional and national borders closed most campsites shut and wild camping banned outsiders being discouraged in many areas and bureaucratic headaches over visas and complicated vehicle permits thousands of travellers around the world are either trapped or having to abandon their homes on wheels and return home  in some ways covid19 has been like a game of musical chairs for overlanders who have found themselves in varying situations depending on where they happened to be when the music stopped  around 10000km north of ushuaia in the colombian city of medellín berliners anne and martin are living in their vw westfalia camper in the driveway of a hostel where they can use the toilets and showers that wouldnt be allowed in many places under lockdown but they happened to be staying there while fixing some mechanical issues when the crisis began the owners allowed them to stay and they decided to sit it out in their van  image copyright anne and martin image caption anne and martin when the going was good  for us there was never a question of leaving the van behind says anne  we also didnt really see the point of returning back to europe as the number of infected people was much higher than here we dont have a home as we moved out of our apartment and sold all our belongings we could stay at our parents places but in our mid30s its not really our goal  the days are getting really long and repetitive we are safe and healthy but we are stuck we miss being on the road she says  radka and ivar missed it too but they couldnt see a light at the end of the tunnel luckily the airport in ushuaia reopened and they booked a flight to buenos aires the van and their gear would have to stay behind but with strict rules in most countries including argentina about how long a foreignplated car can remain there they had just one day to work out the logistics and find a place to park it again through silvias network they managed to secure written permission from a resident who would allow the van to be parked at his house and a letter from the customs authorities enabling them to leave it behind until the crisis is over  it was a stressful day we really hope that everything is ok with the papers says ivar its incredible how it worked out although when we parked the van and left it there i was nervous about handing the keys over because we had never met the guy theres a part of us thats afraid we wont see the van again maybe well show up and theyll be like what car  image copyright radka and ivar image caption radka on the journey south in los glaciares national park  after they arrived in buenos aires their repatriation flight was refused permission to fly just before the next flight a week later they were told they hadnt made the list for nearly three weeks the couple waited in a cheap hostel room in the city feeling increasingly despondent they started to question whether they really would get out finally on 7 may they boarded a norwegian air flight to oslo costing them €1300  back in norway they had to complete 10 days of quarantine but were lucky to have access to a rural family cabin where they sat it out in peace  we have gone through all the emotions… but right now were just really happy to be back in norway says ivar  on a scale of one to 10 the disappointment is 11 says radka  the longer we stayed and the worse i felt i said ok i admit it i cant imagine spending another four months like this so im willing to spend some of our savings on going home to norway where people have a bit more freedom i was going crazy  the selfconfessed pessimist of the pair she worries about whether they can gather the funds to return to argentina and if they do whether tourists will still be welcomed under the new normal  and i feel like we have lost time if we start the trip again in say january that was a time when we were supposed to be somewhere else in our life i have a hard time letting go  a few months in norway will give them some perspective says ivar  we would have felt worse if it was something that we should have seen coming i think we did everything we could and i am at peace with that i feel like were pretty lucky compared with many other people i know we will continue the journey  our car is in tanzania we could be fined €1400  many overlanders who have abandoned their vehicles are risking penalties from fines to confiscation for failing to drive their van out of the country by the time agreed when they entered when you drive into a country you usually temporarily import the vehicle for a fixed period after which penalties begin to be imposed  image copyright armin and tanja  armin and tanja from germany were driving their 2004 mitsubishi camper through tanzania as part of a planned twoyear trip through the balkans africa and south america when the pandemic struck initially hoping to stick it out they eventually decided to take one of the last repatriation flights out  we found a place to store the car safely on private ground if we hadnt have found that place we definitely would not have left our camper behind says armin  their carnet de passage  a type of vehicle permit that has a cash deposit related to the value of the car  will expire in june attempts to arrange special dispensation with the customs authorities before they left were unsuccessful and they have so far been unable to get hold of the right people in tanzania to help them  image copyright armin and tanja  the penalty for an expired carnet in tanzania would be €1400 in our case as it is 20 of the carnet car value we are lucky that we have quite an old car but still we hope to get out of this without paying we will ask for a flexible solution says armin  the delay has caused them to cut out the south america leg of their world trip but they hope

239,after the wall fell,“by any standard this is a profoundly shocking case  noone should go to work and die in 21st century britain”  daniel lemberger cooper the families’ lawyer works for imran khan  partners the firm that represented the family of the murdered black teenager stephen lawrence  he maintains the tragedy at shredmet is only a small part of a wider problem the men’s deaths he warns have implications for anyone employed in similar jobs  the industry the men were employed in  waste and recycling  is the second most dangerous in the uk between 2014 and 2018 almost eight in every 100000 workers died this rate is 17 times the national average according to a 2019 hse report  it is among the uk’s most lucrative industries worth an estimated £7bn a year to the economy in recent years it has enjoyed a boom demand has been driven by rising metal prices a shortage of landfill sites and laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in them  mr cooper says the recycling industry “exploits migrant labour for enormous profits”  daniel lemberger cooper said the mens deaths raised issues for every worker in britain daniel lemberger cooper said the mens deaths raised issues for every worker in britain  “there is a now huge demand for recycling and the industry is getting bigger and bigger and these workers will be needed more and more” he says  “the five men were honest hardworking and decent human beings  “the conditions in which these workers were employed of precarious employment zerohours contracts temporary and agency work the socalled gig economy and exploitation and issues of low pay and long hours are spreading throughout the economy” he adds  “this is an issue for every worker in britain”  leading safety experts say the standard of the uk’s health and safety enforcement has declined over the past decade  after years of cuts there are fewer inspectors carrying out fewer inspections leaving many workplaces unsafe they say  shredmet had not been inspected by the hse since the 2010 accident in which an employee injured their arm  lawrence waterman chairman of the british safety council says the hse has been underresourced since the days of the coalition government  in 2010 the government imposed 33 cuts on the hse then in 2012 the prime minister david cameron stated the uks excessive health and safety culture was costing businesses billions and he intended to kill it off for good  after the conservatives won the general election in 2015 further cuts followed in the spending review later that year  lawrence waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe lawrence waterman said more effort was needed to keep workplaces safe  “it’s not just resources that have had an impact” says mr waterman  it’s the political hangover of now two prime ministers ago who wanted to kill health and safety with a feeling that red tape ruled and we were being told how to live our lives  “well the other side of that is that five guys never came home to their families  “hanging over businesses and the government is the need to be honest and place more value on looking after people at work”  hilda palmer from the hazards campaign which promotes workplace safety says a disproportionately large number of those killed or injured at work are immigrants  “unfortunately if you look at the names of the people that are killed they are mostly foreignsounding names  eastern europeans and now west african” she says  “i also know of a case involving some peruvians it seems it’s the new wave of migrants that get drawn in  the most vulnerable”  flowers left at the site of the accident in 2016 flowers left at the site of the accident in 2016  she says legislation enforcement and trade unions have all been “attacked through the cuts”  “that creates an environment for cowboys to flourish” she added “if employers see checks being done prosecutions fines and notices being issued that reminds them to act”  the conservatives declined to comment but vince cable the former liberal democrat leader who was a member of the coalition cabinet says the global financial crisis was to blame  “austerity was going to happen whatever government came in” he says  “the cuts labour chancellor alistair darling had were the same as what the coalition did and this was as a result of the huge financial crisis and reduced revenue that the country found itself in”  laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling laws restricting the dumping of electronic equipment in landfill have fuelled demand for recycling  the dead mens families remain bewildered that three years after the accident the hse has still not decided whether or not to charge shredmet  mr waterman says the slowness of the hse investigation is due to its underfunding the hse aims to complete 80 of fatal investigations within one year but in 201819 just 65 were  “when you look at that it’s not unreasonable for the families to feel that justice is being denied” mr waterman says  “if the families of the five guys were pluggedin middleclass agitators there may have been more pressure being felt to keep the hse focused on finding out what happened”  “if immediate legislative change is not enacted there are going to be more injuries and further deaths”  the hse says the families’ demand for a speedy conclusion is “understandable” but it needs to ensure its investigation is “thorough”  “as with many complex challenging criminal investigations relating to multiple fatalities following new lines of inquiry and forensically examining evidence can mean investigations take longer than families would understandably hope” a spokesman says  “since the inquests concluded our time and energy has been fully focused on reviewing the case bringing together evidence heard by the coroner and concluding the criminal investigation  “we are working hard to resolve any delays and have endeavoured to give regular updates to the families where possible”  the families lawyer believes they are the victims of a legal system that does not treat deaths at work with the same seriousness as other fatalities  “the criminal justice system fails to treat deaths and injuries at work – unlike deaths in almost any other setting – as the possible outcome of serious crimes and this must urgently change” mr cooper says  he wants the government to legislate to prevent the exploitation of workers  “a fitting tribute and legacy to those that died would be that immediate steps are taken by government to ensure that we learn the lessons of why these men died so that noone else suffers like they have” he says  “if immediate legislative change is not enacted there are going to be more injuries and further deaths the government and employers will have blood on their hands”

241,coronavirus sports events in march caused increased suffering and death,image copyright pa media image caption more than 250000 people flocked to cheltenham for its annual horse racing festival in march  two major sporting events held in march caused increased suffering and death the scientist leading the uks largest covid19 tracking project has said  data gathered from millions of volunteers found coronavirus hotspots shortly after the cheltenham festival and liverpools champions league match against atletico madrid  professor tim spector said rates of cases locally increased severalfold  the government said many factors could influence cases in a particular area  less than three months ago sport across the uk was continuing as normal despite the impending threat of coronavirus  which had already prompted some european countries to stage such events without spectators or completely call them off  sports governing bodies in the uk were taking their cue from prime minister boris johnson who declared in early march that people should as far as possible go about business as usual  on the first weekend in march there was a full programme of football in both england and scotland five horse racing meetings and six nations rugby at twickenham between england and wales  which the prime minister himself attended  it was a different matter elsewhere a forthcoming six nations match in dublin had already been postponed along with the chinese grand prix and football matches in virusstricken northern italy  the uk governments stance remained consistent just 24 hours before cheltenham opened its gates to 250000 spectators on 10 march culture secretary oliver dowden rebuffed growing calls for a ban on mass outdoor gatherings  he told the bbc theres no reason for people not to attend such events or to cancel them at this stage  but prof spector from kings college london said people will have probably died prematurely because of the decision  image copyright european photopress agency image caption thousands of fans made the journey from spain to anfield  so did these events contribute to a surge in coronavirus cases  its impossible to say for certain but figures seen by the bbc radio 4s file on 4 programme show in the last week of march liverpool and cheltenham were among the areas with the highest number of suspected cases  the figures come from the covid19 symptom study and show an estimated 56 of the population aged 20 to 69 having symptoms in those two regions  not to be confused with the governments contacttracing app the research draws on information uploaded by more than three million volunteers around the uk who submit daily reports identifying whether they have any of the 15 symptoms associated with covid19  five things the coronavirus tracking app tells us  image copyright melanie finn image caption melanie finn left the cheltenham festival early because of concerns about coronavirus  irish journalist melanie finn recalls the stark difference in approach on either side of the irish sea as she flew in to the cheltenham festival from dublin  we had already cancelled the st patricks day celebrations and that in itself was huge for us she said  people were in shock noone could believe that was happening that was an indicator of how serious the irish government was when we flew out of dublin airport it was literally like a ghost town  melanie said that racegoers at cheltenham on the other hand believed the uk government would have cancelled the event if they had thought it was unsafe  she said people ignored basic safety rules it was like the last days of the roman empire and i think there was a little bit of a sense that if it was open by god they were going to party  she was so concerned by what she saw that she asked her employer to fly her home midway through the festival  a week later she developed the symptoms of covid19 and had to take two weeks off work  the jockey club had previously defended the decision to go ahead with the festival telling the guardian on 2 april that it had followed clear and ongoing guidance from the government and science experts  it added we promoted the latest public health advice and introduced a range of additional hygiene measures at the event including hundreds of hand sanitiser dispensers and extra wash basins  on 11 march  the second day of the festival  the world health organization declared coronavirus a pandemic  jumping all over each other  later that evening liverpool hosted atletico madrid in a champions league football match at anfield  around 3000 visiting fans were allowed to travel to merseyside and mingle in bars and restaurants despite the fact madrid was the epicentre of the outbreak in spain and at that point accounted for almost half of the countrys confirmed cases  liverpool supporter joel rookwood who has been ill for eight weeks believes he contracted covid19 that evening and recalled how when goals were scored spectators were oblivious to the risk of transmitting the virus  the celebrations were some of the most physical that ive experienced he said people were jumping all over each other  the spirit of shankly a liverpool supporters group said it raised concerns about the arrival of fans from madrid at a councilchaired safety meeting two days before the match but were told it would go ahead in accordance with government advice  but liverpool fc would not have been able to unilaterally call off the match  to decide which of the two clubs progressed to the champions league quarterfinals that decision would have had to come from one of footballs governing bodies such as the competitions organiser uefa  prof spector said i think sporting events should have been shut down at least a week earlier because theyll have caused increased suffering and death that wouldnt otherwise have occurred  in a statement the government said there are many factors that could influence the number of cases in a particular area including population density age general health and the position of an area on the pandemic curve  to hear more on this story listen to file on 4  game changer

242,the remarkable power of the prickly pear,the landscape could be one straight from a postcard of a mexican desert with strong sun almost directly overhead a green field of cacti cover the dusty surroundings of camémbaro a farming community in the state of michoacan nopal as this type of ovalleafed plant is known all over the country does not only grow in these lands also known as the prickly pear it can be found all over the mesoamerican region and it is so emblematic that it has a prime spot on mexico’s national flag it is regularly consumed as salad or in healthy shakes or in less virtuous tortillas and nacho chips the inedible waste products are normally discarded but in this town after the cactus had given all it can as a food people saw the potential of turning this waste into a new fuel source  in 2009 local businessman rogelio sosa lopez had already succeeded in the cornmade tortilla industry and partnered with miguel angel ake to found nopalimex a company that grows cacti as a cheaper alternative to corn they found that nopal crops produce between 300 and 400 tonnes of biomass per hectare in less fertile lands and up to 8001000 tonnes in richer soils nopal also requires minimum water consumption and its waste if properly processed can be turned into biofuel  “we are sowing nopal for three reasons the first one is social – it creates jobs and prevents emigration secondly from an economic perspective it reduces the cost of industrial processing of nopalbased products lastly and most importantly there is an environmental reason” says ake the hope is that biofuel from nopal can be a viable alternative to fossil fuels in the region  you might also like  ake started to explore biofuels more than 40 years ago but he began to experiment with cacti in 2007 now his company is producing enough fuel for the buildings that process all parts of the nopal plant in a sustainable way but he plans to go further he has already signed a commitment with the local government of zitacuaro in the state of michoacan to provide official vehicles from police cars to ambulances with cactusbased fuel  “with the amount of nopal we have in mexico and a productivity of over 100 tonnes of gas per acre we believe that this could eventually replace the traditional use of gas and fuel of nonrenewable sources” he says  the process is relatively simple first the cacti are cut and processed to extract flour which is used to make tortilla chips the remaining inedible scraps of the plant are mixed with cow dung in a bioprocessor a fermentation tank that heats the wasted cactus pulp then the fuel is distilled from the remaining liquid and collected via tubes and into a tank

244,why first nations communities are uninviting visitors,the idea of covid19 entering the remote first nation’s community of bella bella terrifies marilyn slett chief councillor of the heiltsuk tribal council located on british columbia’s bc central coast the water and airaccess only community of 1400 is a gateway to canada’s great bear rainforest a region the size of ireland that’s famed for its ecotourism opportunities  one of 198 distinct first nations in bc each with its own unique traditions and history the heiltsuk nation has spent years revitalising and preserving its culture the long process reached a milestone with the november 2019 opening of the community’s first big house where the heiltsuk gathered for sacred communal events to be built in 200 years and more plans are in the future but as it does in many indigenous communities the future takes its cues from the past and covid19 which is particularly dangerous to older people therefore puts the community’s future at risk  “our laws and traditions are oral” said slett “they’re passed down by our knowledge keepers” a group of elders who have learned the nation’s customs traditions and protocols “we only have 30 fluent hailhzaqvlaspeaking elders left” she added “we’ll uphold heiltsuk laws and do everything we can to protect them”  slett is referring to the emergency measures her community has put in place like many indigenous communities in coastal bc and around the world the heiltsuk nation has enacted a strict lockdown opting to go well beyond the provincial guidelines by banning all nonessential travel in or out of their territory  we only have 30 fluent hailhzaqvlaspeaking elders left  on the roads and in the public ferry terminals leading into the normally touristfriendly communities on bc’s coast checkpoints have been set up manned by guardian watchmen who typically act as friendly ambassadors and cultural interpreters out on the water these guardians are using ais automatic identification system to identify track and intercept any boat that arrives in their waters their role is to ensure the vessel should be there and turn it back if it’s not shifted to a new frontline these traditional protectors stewards and guardians of first nations lands and waters have begun rediscovering the power of protecting a nation’s greatest treasure its people  canada’s indigenous people have always been stewards of their land and culture – but what’s changed is how they now combine western science and law with cultural knowledge and traditional laws to secure their survival often the weight of this combination is directed towards things like sovereignty claims archaeology has been used to secure land claims but now communities who cherish their elders for the guidance they provide are listening to international health guidelines and then combining that knowledge with their own values in the way that protects the community best  it’s not difficult to understand why the heiltsuk have opted to manage the pandemic by following the advice of their own leaders and shutting off their community to outsiders for 14000 years they have lived in balance within a territory that spans about 15540 sq km and extends through the great bear rainforest heiltsuk historians estimate that at their cultural peak as many as 20000 people lived in 50 summer and winter villages set in ancient forests of huge sitka spruce red cedar western hemlock and douglas fir  you may also be interested in  • the communities that predicted covid19  • the littleknown uscanada border war  • japans forgotten indigenous people  european contact dating from the 1780s brought devastation “we survived smallpox we survived measles we survived government policy” slett said but the onslaught took its toll in the 1880s the remnants of the severely depleted heiltsuk communities gathered into one village near bella bella their population had been diminished to around 200 people  and then the 1918 flu came “my mom told me about my grandmother who remembered the ladies crying and talking about all of the losses there were whole households passing away – and no time for proper burials” said slett  cultural devastation wasn’t unique to the heiltsuk in many indigenous tourism offerings in canada that painful and turbulent journey is something visitors learn about “our most effective businesses are built around sharing culture and cultural revitalisation” said keith henry president and ceo of the indigenous tourism association of canada  since time immemorial guardians have had a role in managing land and water and in exerting rights  more than opportunities to see wildlife hear songs or learn how people create art or survive off the land modern indigenous tourism in canada is a 18bn industry that combines experiences with culture in a way that celebrates the warmth humour and resilience of indigenous people  “it’s not disneyfying us it’s not making us like a petting zoo it’s really just sharing who we are” said henry  located 55km north of bella bella the kitasoo  xaixais nations village of klemtu is also on lockdown chief councillor roxanne robinson says the decision to close the community to outsiders was an obvious one as “protecting the health and safety of people is the work of a leader”  the rugged landscape and wildlife which includes whales coastal wolves black bears grizzly bears and the spirit bear attracts visitors from all over the world and makes up a vital part of the local economy robinson says that closing their community in midmarch was a hard choice but it was just in time just south heiltsuk watchmen on the water reported they started turning back yachts american and canadian boaters trying to flee big cities and those who wanted to hunt or fish which is considered essential in bc but not by the coastal communities had started heading for more remote covid19­free communities  in normal times these guardian watchmen would ensure people knew to stay away from sacred sites and to follow wildlife regulations  a global concern inadequate healthcare and higher rates of chronic health conditions means indigenous communities around the world are at greater risk from covid19 argentina home to at least 35 officially recognised indigenous communities some have opted to insulate themselves from outsiders  australia some remote indigenous communities locked themselves down early they were quickly supported by the federal government which is using its biosecurity act to limit access to essential staff and services  brazil with 850000 indigenous people different groups are responding with strict isolation guarding their communities from outsiders and using traditional treatments  kenya maasai people have traditionally survived pandemics by isolating deeper into their territory during covid19 many people are currently scattered and isolated  us the navajo nation is one of the epicentres of the virus in the us and currently has the highest infection rates in the country  “they are an extension of nationhood” said claire hutton indigenous stewardship director at conservation organisation nature united “since time immemorial guardians have had a role in managing land and water and in exerting rights”  in earlier kitasoo  xaixais villages robinson said there was always one guardian watchman situated outside the village to watch for strangers while in the heiltsuk culture the guardian watchmen were informal custodians of the land and water following traditional laws to protect food sources and conserve the landscape  while the ancient tradition faded with colonisation modern guardian watchmen programmes came into being in the 1980s with programmes in haida gwaii 200km west of bella bella and in the innu territories in labrador today more than 50 different programmes in nations across canada fulfil a wide variety of different roles depending on what a community may need  hutton who coordinates a team that provides technical support to guardians across canada says the programmes are as distinct as the nations themselves but there are common themes and issues many are focused on stewardship and ensuring the protection of traditional food sources some have a strong science focus and guardians are critical for data collection and monitoring biodiversity or species at risk other programmes concentrate on tourism and the guardians act as interpreters  the goal of nature united is to support the guardians with resources that match their requirements but manning checkpoints to prevent the spread of covid19 has brought up an unexpected set of needs “offering conflict training and tactical communications webinars is new” hutton said  as the guardian watchmen shift from scientific data gathering and land preservation to guarding the frontlines they’ve encountered pushback from travellers who question their authority while british columbia’s ministry of indigenous relations and reconciliation agree that first nations have the authority to restrict travel into their communities at the same time the province like many places has begun reopening forcing indigenous communities to protect themselves  slett says while it would be better if canada and bc reinforced indigenous restrictions the communities have the knowledge they need and are ready to safeguard themselves  following traditional laws which focus on balancing the needs of the people the environment and the economy coastal nations which battled each other in ancient times have come together in an effort to keep out outsiders haida gwaii and the central and north coast including the heiltsuk and kitasoo  xaixais nations have set up a coalition they are working collectively to let visitors know that while they are valued and wanted now is not the time to visit the communities are simply too vulnerable to risk any loss  we are selfisolating at this time so that when we gather again nobody is left behind  “we know that this isn’t over and it’s going to be a few years before there’s a vaccination and it’s no longer a threat to humankind” slett said “indigenous communities cannot be left on the sidelines and on the fringes of what’s going on we need to work together as we uphold our measures”  meanwhile the heiltsuk – and other lockeddown communities that have closed their borders ­– have turned inward “we have guardian watchmen that are out there daily we also have a patrol that monitors the entry points of the community” said slett “and we’re turning to our knowledge keepers to see what we can do in terms of adapting during this period”  what the knowledge keepers are teaching is the value of selfsufficiency all along the coast communities are relying more heavily on traditional marine foods like eulachon oil smoked salmon fresh herring eggs and roasted seaweed community gardens are being started and leaders are encouraging people to find strength in the power of looking after themselves  “if you look through our histories i can’t imagine our ancestors or our leadership of 30 40 50 100 years ago having the kind of confidence to determine our future this directly” said henry while the financial implications of shutting down tourism will hurt communities he added the whole point of tourism all along has been to strengthen the culture nations making their own decisions does that  slett said that they want tourists they want visitors but later right now they need to get everyone through the pandemic safely

245,what do our dreams mean,dreams have fascinated philosophers and artists for centuries they have been seen as divine messages a way of unleashing creativity and since the advent of psychoanalysis in the 19th century the key to understanding our unconscious as so many of us have been experiencing unusually vivid dreams in recent weeks it seems an opportune moment to explore the way in which they have been understood and depicted throughout the centuries in doing so we may even find some intriguing parallels with our own experiences  more like this   the art history of masks   paintings that find light in darkness   the rainbows that swept the world  but why are we dreaming so vividly now “we’re in a new situation so there’s new emotions to process” says psychotherapist philippa perry who was inundated with replies when she recently asked her followers to send her their dreams on twitter we make up narratives to make sense of those feelings that in dream manifest themselves “not straightforwardly but in metaphors” she explains

247,planting trees doesn’t always help with climate change,suddenly we are all being told to plant trees the hope is that they will save us from the worst effects of climate change  the idea is everywhere the swedish climate activist greta thunberg has made a film arguing for extra protections for the world’s forests and for the replanting of those that have been cut down george monbiot a columnist in the uk’s guardian newspaper has founded a campaign called natural climate solutions which advocates restoring forests and other ecosystems  this is not just talk the uk government has planted millions of trees over the last decade and has pledged another million between 2020 and 2024 others have attempted far more dramatic feats in 2016 one indian state planted 50 million trees in one day while in july last year ethiopia claimed to have planted 350 million in a day even the uk’s daily mail a rightwing newspaper not known for its climate activism has just launched a campaign encouraging all its readers to plant a tree  you might also like  protecting existing forests and planting new ones are surely good things to do however scientists say we must not place too much faith in trees to save us in particular earlier this year one research group claimed we can plant a trillion extra trees and remove a quarter of the carbon dioxide currently in the air these figures have been widely criticised as overhyped and unreliable trees will definitely help us slow climate change but they won’t reverse it on their own  the underlying problem is that our society is releasing greenhouse gases especially carbon dioxide co2 that are warming the earth’s climate to levels we have never experienced before as a result the great ice sheets are melting contributing to rising seas and extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts are becoming more severe
248,why we’ve created new language for coronavirus,throughout history challenging circumstances have given rise to new ways of expressing those challenges george eliot the 19th century writer who was famously frustrated by rigid gender and lifestyle norms is credited with the first recorded use of the word ‘frustrating’ more recently brexit led to a flowering of new words including the inevitable ‘bremain’ and ‘bregret’ and a repurposing of existing words such as ‘backstop’  while brexit may be the closest parallel the speed of the linguistic change we’re seeing with covid19 is unprecedented says robert lawson a sociolinguist at birmingham city university lawson attributes this to multiple factors the dizzying pace at which the virus has spread its dominance in the media and global interconnectivity at a time when social media and remote contact are so important  many of the newly popular terms relate to the socially distanced nature of human contact these days such as ‘virtual happy hour’ ‘covideo party’ and ‘quarantine and chill’ many use ‘corona’ as a prefix whether polish speakers convert ‘coronavirus’ into a verb or english speakers wonder how ‘coronababies’ the children born or conceived during the pandemic will fare and of course there are abbreviations like the ubiquitous ‘wfh’ and the lifesaving ‘ppe’  old words in a new light  like everyone else lexicologists are scrambling to keep up with the changes the pandemic has wrought according to fiona mcpherson the senior editor of the oxford english dictionary oed back in december ‘coronavirus’ appeared only 003 times per million tokens tokens are the smallest units of language collected and tracked in the oed corpus the term ‘covid19’ was only coined in february when the who announced the official name of the virus but in april the figures for both ‘covid19’ and ‘coronavirus’ had skyrocketed to about 1750 per million tokens suggesting that the two terms are now being used at roughly the same frequency

251,dominic cummings minister douglas ross quits over senior aides lockdown actions,image copyright pa media image caption boris johnson said he regretted douglas ross decision to stand down  junior minister douglas ross has resigned after dominic cummings defence of his trip to county durham during the coronavirus lockdown  mr ross under secretary of state for scotland said the senior aides view of the government guidance was not shared by the vast majority of people  mr cummings has explained why he drove 260 miles in march from his home to his parents farm with his wife and child  no 10 said the prime minister regretted mr ross decision to stand down  in a statement announcing his resignation mr ross who remains tory mp for moray said while the intentions may have been well meaning the reaction to this news shows that mr cummings interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked  i have constituents who didnt get to say goodbye to loved ones families who could not mourn together people who didnt visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government  i cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right  a no 10 spokesman said the prime minister would like to thank douglas ross for his service to government and regrets his decision to stand down as parliamentary under secretary of state for scotland  mr cummings has faced calls to resign after it emerged he had driven his child and ill wife from london to county durham during lockdown  at a news conference in the garden of 10 downing street on monday afternoon he said he did not regret his actions and believed he acted reasonably and legally  on the subject of why he then drove his family to the town of barnard castle  15 days after he had displayed symptoms  mr cummings said he was testing his eyesight to see if he could make the trip back down to london he explained that he had experienced some eyesight problems during his illness  earlier on tuesday cabinet office minister michael gove said mr cummings account of his actions was exhaustive detailed and verifiable and people will make their own mind up  most people will understand he was under pressure and sought to put the health of his wife and son first and took care to ensure they as a family unit were not in danger of infecting other people he told the bbc  boris johnson has said he regrets the confusion and anger caused by the row but has continued to back mr cummings  douglas ross backed boris johnson to be tory leader and is not one of those in the party seen as hostile to his style of government  so this resignation is a blow  and could point to wider discontent  there is a scottish subplot  the scottish tories have been accused of hypocrisy for demanding scotlands chief medical officer resign then staying quiet about dominic cummings  but mr rosss reasons for resigning are scathing  he says he cannot tell his constituents in good faith that they were wrong to miss funerals and other family events but mr cummings was right  he says he has listened to his constituents and resigned the question now is whether other tory mps are continuing to get the same feedback  labours shadow scottish secretary ian murray said mr ross had done the decent thing by resigning  he understands that its not acceptable to have one rule for boris johnsons closest adviser another for everybody else he said  the snps westminster leader ian blackford said he respected mr ross for taking the difficult decision to resign and called for mr cummings to be removed from his post without further delay  this issue transcends politics it is about protecting trust and confidence in the public health advice he said in a tweet  opposition mps are due to meet later to discuss their next steps in deciding how to hold boris johnson and his senior aide to account  labour has criticised mr cummings for failing to apologise for his actions while other parties are calling for him to be sacked  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption cummings didnt break the guidelines says gove  following mondays press conference several government ministers posted messages of support for mr cummings on twitter  however william wragg tory mp for hazel grove said it was humiliating and degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an advisor  simon jupp is among the latest tory mps to say mr cummings should consider his position saying he has felt anger disappointment and frustration during the deeply unhelpful distraction  veteran tory mp sir roger gale has also called for mr cummings to resign telling the bbc he had sent out a very damaging and dangerous message to the public  the row overshadowed mr johnsons announcement on monday that all nonessential shops in england will be allowed to reopen from 15 june provided they meet new social distancing and hygiene measures  they follow outdoor markets and car showrooms which will be allowed to reopen from 1 june  but with online shopping booming during the lockdown there are questions over whether customers will return  latest government figures show the number of people to die with coronavirus in the uk rose by 121 to 36914 on monday  in other developments

253,scrubs a sitcom thats actually aged well,image copyright getty images  well what you were doing 20 years ago on tuesday 16 march laughs scrubs star donald faison  i dont have an answer but then in my defence i was eight years old  im on a zoom call with donald and his scrubs costar zach braff to talk about their new podcast  in fake doctors real friends they have another watch of the sitcom which made them famous and reminisce about what it was like to film  theres just one problem they barely remember a lot of it  i think its better that way smiles zach were watching it anew like an actual viewer of the show  image copyright getty images image caption donald l and zach r with the shows creator bill lawrence c  scrubs ran from 2001 to 2010 and it tells the story of a group of young doctors as they work their way up the ranks  on the face of it its a sitcom but as well as jokes the episodes are rammed full of sad moments for extra emotional punch theyre usually set to heartwrenching noughties indie by the likes of death cab for cutie  so whether youre going through grief youre facing a breakup or even if youre just struggling with work  theres an episode of scrubs to relate to  and this meant for a lot of fans like me who grew up with the show it became a sort of moral guide  we always have to give a shoutout to the man who created it all bill lawrence zach says  the show without commercials is 22 minutes long and the fact that he can steer it from a moral lesson to crazy comedy fantasies to multiple love stories is just genius writing  i cant stop thinking about that as we watch them 20 years later  theres a lot of morality in it and im glad it rubbed off on people  before the interview ive jotted zach and donald down on my notepad so i dont slip up and call them by their character names jd and turk  its harder than you might think  the pair who play best friends in the show are actually best friends in real life  and when theyre riffing back and forth off each other its easy to forget they dont in fact have any medical training  zach thinks we were best friends at first sight  im a little more realistic about it says donald  i think it was when we hit the club and our eyes met over that first shot of tequila  zach adds donald was famous already so he was already in the club  i was working as a waiter so when i got a tv show and all of a sudden i was allowed in the club he was my sensei my yoda  image copyright getty images image caption donald and zach together in 2018  however long their friendship took to get started it ended up with donald getting married in zachs back garden  and naming him godfather to his children  wed be flipping through the script and be like um this is the story we told the writers about what happened to us zach says when i ask how their relationship influenced the show  so it became a thing that sort of fed itself  you might think revisiting a 20yearold show would be a dangerous game  friends finished three years after scrubs started its now found its way onto netflix and has faced accusations that its homophobic sexist and toowhite  scrubs too is now available for a new audience to find for uk viewers all nine series were added to channel 4s streaming service all 4 earlier this month  in the usa its available on disneys streaming service hulu  image copyright getty images  some of it is way too unpc im sure for now zach admits we often cringe and go okay you definitely couldnt do that joke today  sometimes even at the time things would get censored because the creators were trying to push things as far as they could on network television  overall though both actors think the show has aged pretty well  and for donald thats down to the subject matter  with this whole pandemic going on right now we should shine a light on all of the people in the medical profession  so i definitely think scrubs still holds up for the simple fact that there are still people in the medical profession whore going through the same things  and when i speak to fans on a reddit page dedicated to the show  the consensus seems to be the same  i wont lie there are some jokes that do make me uncomfortable 19yearold clara says but i recognise that was part of the time and i dont think we should pretend otherwise  she references an early episode where a female doctor elliot reid calls out the chief of medicine for calling her sweetheart  although clara says its great the show tackled issues like this the moral of the episode turns out to be that elliot should have picked her battles better  image caption clara is one of those rare people in life who dont bat an eyelid when you ask them to take a photo of themselves with a dvd boxset  but clara thinks there are other ways that the show still comes across as quite progressive  another female character has a monologue near the beginning of the series about how even though she wears a thong shes still a good nurse  i like that they had that attitude that just because you embrace your sexuality that doesnt make you any less strong  she estimates she watches through the first eight seasons of scrubs about once a year does that make me sad she asks  again i dont have an answer  follow newsbeat on instagram facebook twitter and youtube  listen to newsbeat live at 1245 and 1745 weekdays  or listen back here

many of us  struggling to work out what someone in a supermarket or at work is saying when theyre wearing a face mask  but for people who are deaf or have hearing loss masks can prevent them understanding anything at all  you might as well be speaking in french says fizz izagaren a paediatric doctor in the uk who has been profoundly deaf since the age of two  i can hear one or two words but its random it makes no sense… when someone is wearing a face mask ive lost the ability to lip read and ive lost facial expressions  i have lost the key things that make a sentence  it is a problem she shares with the some 466 million people around the world who according to the world health organization have disabling hearing loss  standard face masks which have become widespread as countries try to stop the spread of coronavirus muffle words and obscure the mouth  but now charities and manufacturers alike are coming up with a solution  image caption fizz izagaren says she feels isolated when everyone around her is wearing a standard mask  main dans la main hand in hand an association which supports deaf and hearing impaired people in chevrières northern france is among the organisations around the world that have created a mask with a transparent window  its founder kelly morellon worked with her mother sylvie to devise a design that covers the nose but makes the mouth visible and can be washed at a high temperature to reduce infection  the basic aim of these transparent masks is to allow deaf and hearing impaired people to read the lips of someone speaking to them kelly told the bbc  but they are also very useful for autistic people people with learning difficulties and small children who might be scared of masks or need to be able to see facial expressions  in any case a transparent mask allows you to see each others smiles and at this sad time this could not be more important  image caption the clear screen in kelly morellons design can be removed so the cloth can be washed  unlike some companies around the world  in scotland the us and indonesia for instance  kelly and her mother are not able to produce their masks on a commercial basis  instead they are advising people on how to make their own and there are multiple guidelines online to help their top tip is to use a little washing up soap to stop the plastic screen fogging up  but one setting where homemade masks are not suitable  but where both ppe and communication are vital  is in hospitals  there is just one company in the us that has secured food and drug administration fda approval to make clear masks for clinical use  five hundred of these masks are being used at brigham and womens hospital in the us city of boston at the moment they are being reserved for staff to wear when they are speaking to patients with hearing loss or vice versa sign language interpreters who use facial expressions and lip movements alongside body movements to create more complex and culturally rich signs also wear them  image copyright brigham and women’s hospital image caption james wiggins an american sign language interpreter is among the staff at the brigham who have been wearing the transparent masks  when we saw the covid19 pandemic beginning… we soon realised there was going to be a challenge because of the escalated use of ppe and how that would create communication barriers said dr cheri blauwet who leads the disability task force at the brigham  weve had glowing feedback from patients and were getting broader requests from other parts of the hospital especially the paediatric floors  in the uk there are no approved manufacturers providing clear masks to hospitals and the sole us manufacturer is not taking any more orders as it deals with overwhelming demand  fizz izagaren a paediatric registrar at frimley park hospital in surrey in the uk who is also deaf says standard masks prevent her from taking patients histories verbally she also says she feels isolated at work because she is not able to speak to her colleagues  clear masks should be the norm for everyone in a healthcare setting she says  image copyright epa image caption the elderly are both more at risk from coronavirus and more likely to have hearing loss  she is now working with a product designer to try to come up with a mask that the nhs could use widely but even once a design and a manufacturer are found this could take time to roll out  in the meantime there are concerns the current ppe could stop medical staff getting the required consent from patients  an intensive care nurse working in london who is profoundly deaf told the bbc she had one experience where a patient who also had hearing loss was not able to understand her or her colleagues when they were explaining a procedure the patient could not give consent and the procedure could not go ahead  clear masks would make things a lot easier for me she said  i would be able to do my jobs properly and safely i would have more independence rather than having to rely on others  in the uk eight charities have written to nhs bosses calling for clear masks to be commissioned warning of potentially dangerous situations arising from communication problems nhs england has not yet responded to the letter or to the bbcs request for comment  the uk government says it is supporting cardmedic which provides digital flashcards and other communication aids to nhs trusts there are also apps that transcribe speech into text on a mobile phone  but deaf workers say these workarounds are not always suitable for sensitive or emergency situations  as masks become more widespread in the community  its going to get harder and harder dr izagaren says  im worried the public are going to get more and more frustrated and there will be more discrimination towards the deaf community  it is not just people with hearing loss who could benefit she says  experts suggest that other professions such as taxi drivers or even teachers may find clear masks useful as the coronavirus crisis continues  a niche product initially designed to help the deaf community could in fact make everyones lives better

262,coronavirus sports events in march caused increased suffering and death,image copyright pa media image caption more than 250000 people flocked to cheltenham for its annual horse racing festival in march  two major sporting events held in march caused increased suffering and death the scientist leading the uks largest covid19 tracking project has said  data gathered from millions of volunteers found coronavirus hotspots shortly after the cheltenham festival and liverpools champions league match against atletico madrid  professor tim spector said rates of cases locally increased severalfold  the government said many factors could influence cases in a particular area  less than three months ago sport across the uk was continuing as normal despite the impending threat of coronavirus  which had already prompted some european countries to stage such events without spectators or completely call them off  sports governing bodies in the uk were taking their cue from prime minister boris johnson who declared in early march that people should as far as possible go about business as usual  on the first weekend in march there was a full programme of football in both england and scotland five horse racing meetings and six nations rugby at twickenham between england and wales  which the prime minister himself attended  it was a different matter elsewhere a forthcoming six nations match in dublin had already been postponed along with the chinese grand prix and football matches in virusstricken northern italy  the uk governments stance remained consistent just 24 hours before cheltenham opened its gates to 250000 spectators on 10 march culture secretary oliver dowden rebuffed growing calls for a ban on mass outdoor gatherings  he told the bbc theres no reason for people not to attend such events or to cancel them at this stage  but prof spector from kings college london said people will have probably died prematurely because of the decision  image copyright european photopress agency image caption thousands of fans made the journey from spain to anfield  so did these events contribute to a surge in coronavirus cases  its impossible to say for certain but figures seen by the bbc radio 4s file on 4 programme show in the last week of march liverpool and cheltenham were among the areas with the highest number of suspected cases  the figures come from the covid19 symptom study and show an estimated 56 of the population aged 20 to 69 having symptoms in those two regions  not to be confused with the governments contacttracing app the research draws on information uploaded by more than three million volunteers around the uk who submit daily reports identifying whether they have any of the 15 symptoms associated with covid19  five things the coronavirus tracking app tells us  image copyright melanie finn image caption melanie finn left the cheltenham festival early because of concerns about coronavirus  irish journalist melanie finn recalls the stark difference in approach on either side of the irish sea as she flew in to the cheltenham festival from dublin  we had already cancelled the st patricks day celebrations and that in itself was huge for us she said  people were in shock noone could believe that was happening that was an indicator of how serious the irish government was when we flew out of dublin airport it was literally like a ghost town  melanie said that racegoers at cheltenham on the other hand believed the uk government would have cancelled the event if they had thought it was unsafe  she said people ignored basic safety rules it was like the last days of the roman empire and i think there was a little bit of a sense that if it was open by god they were going to party  she was so concerned by what she saw that she asked her employer to fly her home midway through the festival  a week later she developed the symptoms of covid19 and had to take two weeks off work  the jockey club had previously defended the decision to go ahead with the festival telling the guardian on 2 april that it had followed clear and ongoing guidance from the government and science experts  it added we promoted the latest public health advice and introduced a range of additional hygiene measures at the event including hundreds of hand sanitiser dispensers and extra wash basins  on 11 march  the second day of the festival  the world health organization declared coronavirus a pandemic  jumping all over each other  later that evening liverpool hosted atletico madrid in a champions league football match at anfield  around 3000 visiting fans were allowed to travel to merseyside and mingle in bars and restaurants despite the fact madrid was the epicentre of the outbreak in spain and at that point accounted for almost half of the countrys confirmed cases  liverpool supporter joel rookwood who has been ill for eight weeks believes he contracted covid19 that evening and recalled how when goals were scored spectators were oblivious to the risk of transmitting the virus  the celebrations were some of the most physical that ive experienced he said people were jumping all over each other  the spirit of shankly a liverpool supporters group said it raised concerns about the arrival of fans from madrid at a councilchaired safety meeting two days before the match but were told it would go ahead in accordance with government advice  but liverpool fc would not have been able to unilaterally call off the match  to decide which of the two clubs progressed to the champions league quarterfinals that decision would have had to come from one of footballs governing bodies such as the competitions organiser uefa  prof spector said i think sporting events should have been shut down at least a week earlier because theyll have caused increased suffering and death that wouldnt otherwise have occurred  in a statement the government said there are many factors that could influence the number of cases in a particular area including population density age general health and the position of an area on the pandemic curve  to hear more on this story listen to file on 4  game changer

267,how do you ease your dog out of lockdown,image copyright rebecca hall image caption ellie went into lockdown as a young puppy and her owners fear coming out of it might throw up some issues  the end of lockdown is just about visible on the horizon  but as we plan for life outside the workfromhome bubble dog owners are being urged to consider how their pets might cope with our new normal  after more than two months of staying at home working from home and staying close to home on walks the easing of restrictions could have an adverse effect on animals  a glasgowbased dog expert has issued some invaluable guidance  separation anxiety  he says easing dogs out of lockdown is much more complex than being able to go for a longer walk or leaving them in the house more and it could manifest in upsetting physical symptoms  dr chris muldoon operations manager at the charity dogs for good has many years experience of training dogs he says separation anxiety could be a real threat when owners go back to work  image copyright rebecca hall image caption samson the corgi has become used to his owners working from home every day  he believes owners will have to gradually prepare their dogs for the change and reintroduce them to old routines so they dont struggle to cope once coronavirus social distancing measures are lifted  elevated heart rate  dr muldoon said separation anxiety is triggered by the removal of something in the dogs life that is a constant part of its life at the moment and generally that is people  so if you leave the home at 0730 in the morning you grab your keys and head out of the door these can be triggers for the dog to realise that the rest of the day is going to be spent without the person they would rather be with  image copyright dogs for good image caption dr chris muldoon says dogs behaviour should be monitored coming out of lockdown  chris says the dogs reaction can manifest in physical behaviour  like becoming hyperactive for the period of time before its owner leaves home  he said even after you have left you may get complaints from the neighbour that your dog has been continually barking or you may get a destructive dog that potentially is tearing up bits of the house  and you may get reactions that are just anxietybased whining elevated heart rate respirations signs the dog is struggling  our puppy only knows this lockdown situation  image copyright rebeccca hall image caption rebecca hall and ellie  corgis samson and ellie are the pride and joy of rebecca hall and andrew mclaughlan who live in glasgow  they have no worries about samson who takes everything in his stride but ellie was a young puppy when lockdown started and she missed socialising and separation training carried out with the older dog  the dogs routine changed when their owners became confined to home  rebecca said now we are in all the time samson gets sick of us and needs his space so we have given him a safe space in a quiet corner of the room he was used to two walks a day and naps after his walks but with the allowance of one outdoor trip a day he has only had one walk and not had the peace and quiet for his naps  ellie is a puppy who now knows nothing other than having humans around 247 and now doesnt know what its like to be left alone  she has tried to prepare the dogs by leaving them alone for short periods  i think samson will adjust back to normal life quite well but with ellie its going to cause some separation anxiety and i also think she has missed out on a lot of socialisation  she hasnt met many other people other than ourselves and neighbours and she is beyond the puppy weeks that are essential for exposing them to things so we are already seeing she has some fear of new humans and especially other dogs  how can you take your dog out of lockdown  dr muldoon has some tips for getting dogs used to their owners leaving the home again  they include  pretending to go to work  wearing office clothes in the house and picking up your keys and going outside for a few minutes can get the dog used to you leaving again mix up the times you try this and extend the amount of time you spend away  image copyright getty images image caption dogs may have become used to their owners being at home more  dont make a fuss  when you come back in dont make a fuss of the dog wait until dog settles and then reward the dog for settling down  be patient and dont get negative  if the dog barks dont react the worst thing for anxiety is to create more anxiety  be responsible  coming out of lockdown people will be allowed to take longer walks and that will mean interacting with other dogs  dr muldoon said if you were a responsible dog owner before lockdown be an even more responsible dog walker now because your dog might not have interacted with another dog for months or longer so expecting it to behave as it did before is a bit unrealistic  put some boundaries on that keep your dog on a lead interactive with other dogs in a controlled environment and note any changes in your dogs behaviour  be astute about your dogs behaviour

minister douglas ross has resigned after dominic cummings defence of his trip to county durham during the coronavirus lockdown  mr ross under secretary of state for scotland said the senior aides view of the government guidance was not shared by the vast majority of people  mr cummings has explained why he drove 260 miles in march from his home to his parents farm with his wife and child  no 10 said the prime minister regretted mr ross decision to stand down  in a statement announcing his resignation mr ross who remains tory mp for moray said while the intentions may have been well meaning the reaction to this news shows that mr cummings interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked  i have constituents who didnt get to say goodbye to loved ones families who could not mourn together people who didnt visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government  i cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right  a no 10 spokesman said the prime minister would like to thank douglas ross for his service to government and regrets his decision to stand down as parliamentary under secretary of state for scotland  mr cummings has faced calls to resign after it emerged he had driven his child and ill wife from london to county durham during lockdown  at a news conference in the garden of 10 downing street on monday afternoon he said he did not regret his actions and believed he acted reasonably and legally  on the subject of why he then drove his family to the town of barnard castle  15 days after he had displayed symptoms  mr cummings said he was testing his eyesight to see if he could make the trip back down to london he explained that he had experienced some eyesight problems during his illness  earlier on tuesday cabinet office minister michael gove said mr cummings account of his actions was exhaustive detailed and verifiable and people will make their own mind up  most people will understand he was under pressure and sought to put the health of his wife and son first and took care to ensure they as a family unit were not in danger of infecting other people he told the bbc  boris johnson has said he regrets the confusion and anger caused by the row but has continued to back mr cummings  douglas ross backed boris johnson to be tory leader and is not one of those in the party seen as hostile to his style of government  so this resignation is a blow  and could point to wider discontent  there is a scottish subplot  the scottish tories have been accused of hypocrisy for demanding scotlands chief medical officer resign then staying quiet about dominic cummings  but mr rosss reasons for resigning are scathing  he says he cannot tell his constituents in good faith that they were wrong to miss funerals and other family events but mr cummings was right  he says he has listened to his constituents and resigned the question now is whether other tory mps are continuing to get the same feedback  labours shadow scottish secretary ian murray said mr ross had done the decent thing by resigning  he understands that its not acceptable to have one rule for boris johnsons closest adviser another for everybody else he said  the snps westminster leader ian blackford said he respected mr ross for taking the difficult decision to resign and called for mr cummings to be removed from his post without further delay  this issue transcends politics it is about protecting trust and confidence in the public health advice he said in a tweet  opposition mps are due to meet later to discuss their next steps in deciding how to hold boris johnson and his senior aide to account  labour has criticised mr cummings for failing to apologise for his actions while other parties are calling for him to be sacked  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption cummings didnt break the guidelines says gove  following mondays press conference several government ministers posted messages of support for mr cummings on twitter  however william wragg tory mp for hazel grove said it was humiliating and degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an advisor  simon jupp is among the latest tory mps to say mr cummings should consider his position saying he has felt anger disappointment and frustration during the deeply unhelpful distraction  veteran tory mp sir roger gale has also called for mr cummings to resign telling the bbc he had sent out a very damaging and dangerous message to the public  the row overshadowed mr johnsons announcement on monday that all nonessential shops in england will be allowed to reopen from 15 june provided they meet new social distancing and hygiene measures  they follow outdoor markets and car showrooms which will be allowed to reopen from 1 june  but with online shopping booming during the lockdown there are questions

292,coronavirus whats the future for the office,image copyright getty images  before the coronavirus pandemic the office was where millions of us spent about a third of our time  however since the lockdown almost half the uks workforce say they have been working from home  and some companies have hinted it could become the future  the notion of putting 7000 people in a building may be a thing of the past said the boss of barclays while morgan stanleys chief said the bank will have much less real estate businessman sir martin sorrell said hed rather invest the £35m he spends on expensive offices in people instead  the game is up for the office as we know it suggests bruce daisley who is the author of the joy of work  unfortunately we might get mistyeyed about it but i think the office in the form it used to be is probably now a thing of the past he told bbc radio 4s today programme i was chatting to someone who works at a major media outlet last week and he said we used to have 1400 people coming into this office every day for the last eight weeks weve had 30 people and the product hasnt changed  he said anyone who thinks things are going to go back to the way things were is bananas  image copyright getty images image caption theres no point getting too nostalgic because the game has changed says mr daisley  but declaring the end of the office is not clearcut says prof andré spicer from city universitys cass business school he predicts a radical decrease in the amount of time people spend in the office  but says office working will not be over for good one reason he suggests is that homeworkers tend not to get promoted as quickly  they tend to get overlooked  so with a recession on the way people may want to be visible  particularly in times of economic crisis people will start thinking i want to be in the workplace the boss needs to see me he adds  prof spicer also suggests offices will remain as hubs where senior managers are based with employees travelling in once or twice a week to meet with their bosses that seems to be similar to twitters plan allowing staff to work from home forever  although keeping offices open if people want to come in  homeworking is not new  its been on the up in recent decades  and many companies have already been trying to save money on rent by hiring coworking space  i think cost is a big driver says prof spicer i think a lot of companies will say we are spending all this money on rent so lets move to more homeworking that was already happening  how will it affect us  many of us have already discovered some of the perks and problems of working from home some are obvious  no commute less chance to socialise with colleagues but others go to the heart of our identity  i think we should all howl at what were losing says lucy kellaway who has written both fiction and nonfiction books about offices i think the most important thing about the office is it gives some sort of meaning to what we do most of what we do at our laptops  lets face it  is pretty much meaningless  the best way of thinking theres some point to it is having other people who are sitting all round you doing the same thing  image copyright getty images image caption prior to the 18th century most office work was done in peoples homes and coffee shops  she adds that offices keep us sane and give us a routine  and once were there we can be a different person she told today i dont know about you but im absolutely sick and tired of being the same person all day as i slouch around at home i want to have different clothes go into the office see different people who become my lifelong friends and have a complete laugh when im there  prof spicer says studies show that people who work from home are more productive and happier  especially without the commute one of the main factors that make people unhappy but among the downsides he cites one study showing homeworkers feel they are in exile and thus become needy towards their bosses  catching their bosss eye becomes their main job its that desire to be seen to be doing stuff and when youre not you become a bit worried and paranoid thats a downside for employees and employers  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption home workers discuss the problems and benefits  another disadvantage is the risk that homeworking could exacerbate inequalities says prof spicer  for example between those who have more space at home than others and between men and women  in my sector academia one big effect is journal submissions from women has massively gone down the obvious reason for that… most childcare and dealing with home tasks is still picked up by women  meanwhile younger workers will miss out on learning from their more experienced colleagues and those informal conversations that lead to good ideas will be gone adds mr daisley  unfortunately i think if were not careful a lot of companies will get rid of the magical things that made work so productive and creative he says  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption how to combat back pain while working from home  for now many office workers are staying at home and when they do go back the uk government recommends staggered shifts oneway routes packed lunches and twometre distances  but whether homeworking is temporary or here to stay the longing for office life continues for some meetings are very much maligned says ms kellaway but goodness i would love to sit around a real meeting table with some real people and a real plate of biscuits right now  how to work remotely full time  in 2015 managers at san francisco social media startup buffer decided to shut their 7000amonth office when they realised most employees were working from home now its team of 90 is scattered around the globe one worked every day while travelling the world another did so from a cruise although the patchy wifi made it far from ideal  here buffer employees andy yates and carolyn kopprasch share their advice for successful remote working  1 find space for chitchat  we do masterminds which helps partly andy says they partner you up with someone else in the company and you have a biweekly or weekly chat and we have a slack channel called water cooler for just random stuff that comes up  2 take time to loop people in  that serendipitous discovery you would get over talking to someone at lunch or in the break room has to be done really creatively and intentionally carolyn says and that takes time and effort for example one of our team mates nicole does a things you might not have known about weekly summary where she combs through all the communication of the entire company and surfaces interesting things  that takes a lot of work but thats the kind of thing it takes to make it work in a company of this many people who are all spread out and dont get to go for lunch together  group video chats are also recorded then shared with colleagues in other time zones who could not join in  3 meet in person  we do a retreat every year and then we do little summits within teams that are more workfocused andy says sadly this years retreat in greece for all buffers employees was cancelled because of coronavirus  employees in the same country or neighbouring countries will also meet up and someone goes to meet new employees in person  4 freedom within reason  the only thing we did which was truly catastrophic was experiment with having a truly flat structure carolyn says we pointed to this concept that if you give individuals freedom they will do their best work but we learned that managers really do add a lot of value and structure people really liked having someone they were accountable to someone who they talk to regularly and unblocks them with challenges  when we got rid of the concept of managers and we were remote that was kind of a disaster communication just broke down  interviews by roland hughes

294,how do you ease your dog out of lockdown,image copyright rebecca hall image caption ellie went into lockdown as a young puppy and her owners fear coming out of it might throw up some issues  the end of lockdown is just about visible on the horizon  but as we plan for life outside the workfromhome bubble dog owners are being urged to consider how their pets might cope with our new normal  after more than two months of staying at home working from home and staying close to home on walks the easing of restrictions could have an adverse effect on animals  a glasgowbased dog expert has issued some invaluable guidance  separation anxiety  he says easing dogs out of lockdown is much more complex than being able to go for a longer walk or leaving them in the house more and it could manifest in upsetting physical symptoms  dr chris muldoon operations manager at the charity dogs for good has many years experience of training dogs he says separation anxiety could be a real threat when owners go back to work  image copyright rebecca hall image caption samson the corgi has become used to his owners working from home every day  he believes owners will have to gradually prepare their dogs for the change and reintroduce them to old routines so they dont struggle to cope once coronavirus social distancing measures are lifted  elevated heart rate  dr muldoon said separation anxiety is triggered by the removal of something in the dogs life that is a constant part of its life at the moment and generally that is people  so if you leave the home at 0730 in the morning you grab your keys and head out of the door these can be triggers for the dog to realise that the rest of the day is going to be spent without the person they would rather be with  image copyright dogs for good image caption dr chris muldoon says dogs behaviour should be monitored coming out of lockdown  chris says the dogs reaction can manifest in physical behaviour  like becoming hyperactive for the period of time before its owner leaves home  he said even after you have left you may get complaints from the neighbour that your dog has been continually barking or you may get a destructive dog that potentially is tearing up bits of the house  and you may get reactions that are just anxietybased whining elevated heart rate respirations signs the dog is struggling  our puppy only knows this lockdown situation  image copyright rebeccca hall image caption rebecca hall and ellie  corgis samson and ellie are the pride and joy of rebecca hall and andrew mclaughlan who live in glasgow  they have no worries about samson who takes everything in his stride but ellie was a young puppy when lockdown started and she missed socialising and separation training carried out with the older dog  the dogs routine changed when their owners became confined to home  rebecca said now we are in all the time samson gets sick of us and needs his space so we have given him a safe space in a quiet corner of the room he was used to two walks a day and naps after his walks but with the allowance of one outdoor trip a day he has only had one walk and not had the peace and quiet for his naps  ellie is a puppy who now knows nothing other than having humans around 247 and now doesnt know what its like to be left alone  she has tried to prepare the dogs by leaving them alone for short periods  i think samson will adjust back to normal life quite well but with ellie its going to cause some separation anxiety and i also think she has missed out on a lot of socialisation  she hasnt met many other people other than ourselves and neighbours and she is beyond the puppy weeks that are essential for exposing them to things so we are already seeing she has some fear of new humans and especially other dogs  how can you take your dog out of lockdown  dr muldoon has some tips for getting dogs used to their owners leaving the home again  they include  pretending to go to work  wearing office clothes in the house and picking up your keys and going outside for a few minutes can get the dog used to you leaving again mix up the times you try this and extend the amount of time you spend away  image copyright getty images image caption dogs may have become used to their owners being at home more  dont make a fuss  when you come back in dont make a fuss of the dog wait until dog settles and then reward the dog for settling down  be patient and dont get negative  if the dog barks dont react the worst thing for anxiety is to create more anxiety  be responsible  coming out of lockdown people will be allowed to take longer walks and that will mean interacting with other dogs  dr muldoon said if you were a responsible dog owner before lockdown be an even more responsible dog walker now because your dog might not have interacted with another dog for months or longer so expecting it to behave as it did before is a bit unrealistic  put some boundaries on that keep your dog on a lead interactive with other dogs in a controlled environment and note any changes in your dogs behaviour  be astute about your dogs behaviour

296,what we can learn from conspiracy theories,in 331 bc something was wrong with rome across the city swathes of eminent men were succumbing to sickness and practically all of them were dying the losses were as baffling as they were alarming  then one day a slave approached a curule aedile – a kind of magistrate – and hinted that she might know why the girl led a team of investigators to various houses where she claimed they would find an alliance of upperclass women secretly preparing poisons they did  the accused were dragged to the central square and asked to prove their innocence since they claimed their concoctions were medicinal would they drink them  alas two of the suspects obliged – and promptly dropped dead mass arrests followed and a further 170 women were found to be involved the incident was a huge scandal in the aftermath the people of rome elected a dedicated official to perform a ritual banishment of evil a tactic which had previously only been used as a last resort after extreme civil unrest  or at least this is the version of events that was dutifully recorded by the respected historian livy who was born a few hundred years later but he wasn’t convinced that the women were really responsible and neither are modernday experts instead livy pointed to a far more rational explanation an epidemic  at the time the city was in the grip of an unknown plague – a common cause of death in the classical world mass poisonings on the other hand were unheard of the case discussed by livy was the first of its kind and the whole affair had struck roman citizens as distinctly odd  in fact the women probably really were preparing medicines – and the rest of the story was heavily embellished or entirely made up the infamous poisonings of 331 bc are thought to be a conspiracy theory to explain deaths that had an obvious cause all along  amid the current pandemic this scenario is oddly familiar since the beginning of april at least 77 phone masts and 40 engineers have been attacked in the uk after some people bought into the erroneous idea that covid19 is somehow being spread by powerful forces in the global telecommunications industry now the rumour has spread to the us where there are fears it may lead to further violence yet again reason is being cast aside in favour of a niche explanation that involves a convoluted secret plot find out why 5g is not responsible for transmitting covid19  the question is why did these alternative stories catch on

304,planting trees doesn’t always help with climate change,suddenly we are all being told to plant trees the hope is that they will save us from the worst effects of climate change  the idea is everywhere the swedish climate activist greta thunberg has made a film arguing for extra protections for the world’s forests and for the replanting of those that have been cut down george monbiot a columnist in the uk’s guardian newspaper has founded a campaign called natural climate solutions which advocates restoring forests and other ecosystems  this is not just talk the uk government has planted millions of trees over the last decade and has pledged another million between 2020 and 2024 others have attempted far more dramatic feats in 2016 one indian state planted 50 million trees in one day while in july last year ethiopia claimed to have planted 350 million in a day even the uk’s daily mail a rightwing newspaper not known for its climate activism has just launched a campaign encouraging all its readers to plant a tree  you might also like  protecting existing forests and planting new ones are surely good things to do however scientists say we must not place too much faith in trees to save us in particular earlier this year one research group claimed we can plant a trillion extra trees and remove a quarter of the carbon dioxide currently in the air these figures have been widely criticised as overhyped and unreliable trees will definitely help us slow climate change but they won’t reverse it on their own  the underlying problem is that our society is releasing greenhouse gases especially carbon dioxide co2 that are warming the earth’s climate to levels we have never experienced before as a result the great ice sheets are melting contributing to rising seas and extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts are becoming more severe
305,the ‘law’ that explains why you cant get anything done,with offices closed in nations around the world many of us are grappling with how to stay productive and on task as we work from home to help provide insight on how to manage this bbc worklife is updating some of our most popular productivity stories from our archive this article was first published on 8 november 2019  “it is a commonplace observation that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion” british naval historian and author cyril northcote parkinson wrote that opening line for an essay in the economist in 1955 but the concept known as ‘parkinson’s law’ still lives on today  i think about it every time i have a deadline how long it takes me to write a story will by and large depend on when my deadline is and how much time i have until then in his somewhat satirical essay parkinson uses the example of an elderly lady writing a postcard to her niece since she has nothing else to do with her time the otherwise simple task takes up her entire day  apparently i’m not the only one for whom the notion rings true ‘parkinson’s law’ took on a life of its own forming the basis of several more essays and a book by parkinson leading to public lectures around the world  but what fewer people know is that parkinson’s original intent was not to take aim at old lady letterwriters or journalists like me but at a different kind of inefficiency – the bureaucratisation of the british civil service in his original essay he pointed out that although the number of navy ships decreased by two thirds and personnel by a third between 1914 and 1928 the number of bureaucrats had still ballooned by almost 6 a year there were fewer people and less work to manage – but management was still expanding and parkinson argued that this was due to factors that were independent of naval operational needs
306,victory gardens a wartime hobby that’s back in fashion,it was late march when the uk lockdown was first announced around the same time i ordered a seedling tray and two packets of “cut ‘n’ come again” leafy greens arugula rucola oriental mustard pak choy and borecole nearly two months later lockdown still hasn’t been lifted but my tufty lettuce leaves have shot up for billions globally the covid19 pandemic has spelt a period of deep uncertainty and stagnation but watching green miracles occur in my vegetable patch has been reassuring i’m not alone in thinking so  the early weeks of the pandemic threw the global supply chain into disarray setting off a wave of stockpiling the us saw a spike in alternative milk sales australia lacked flour on supermarket shelves pasta was scarce in italy and eggs in britain many countries reported fears of labour shortages for perishables such as fresh vegetables according to time magazine as with any crisis people have been quick to take matters into their own hands – as highlighted by soaring seed sales  you may also be interested in  • a british feast from garden weeds  • the dish that ended the plague  • a dish born from the bomb  a recent report by the uks office for national statistics ons shows 42 of britons have taken to gardening to cope with lockdown while a third of a million searched for tips on growing garden variety crops on the royal horticultural society website – the most popular being the humble potato across the uk and beyond people are digging in their backyards potting plants on balconies or using windowsills as suntraps for seedlings  the rush to growyourown has sparked comparisons to ‘victory gardening’ dug either side of the atlantic from north america to great britain and further afield in australia these kitchen gardens became popularised in world war one and world war two when shortages reached critical levels in the allied nations in response governments coordinated domestic campaigns calling upon citizens to fuel the war effort and feed the country working the soil became a patriotic duty  in the uk most widely remembered is the “dig for victory” campaign launched by the british ministry of agriculture in 1939 it was so successful that the number of allotments grew to 17 million in just three years while private gardens with vegetable produce numbered five million  food prices are going up and fresh produce is going to be at a premium  during the same period a horticultural magazine paraphrased napoleon’s claim that the english were a nation of shopkeepers instead writing “we might with equal justice be called a nation of gardeners” the claim stuck our obsession with gardening stretches far beyond a national pastime it is rooted in the british psyche the garden is considered a private sanctuary but also a site of creative expression and personal pride as reflected in the highly competitive british annual “giant vegetable” competitions that spring up from harrogate to carmarthenshire for britons growing our own produce has the added value of bringing locals together  victory gardens were also not just about food cultivating fruit and vegetables boosted morale and built momentum growing for the greater good banded together communities and enabled those stuck at home to play a part however small perhaps this is why the gardens’ legacy can still be felt today while using the analogy of war to describe a viral pandemic is controversial it makes sense that we‘ve connected the two moments in time it is the sense of community spirit we want to revive – and a victory garden quite literally says we are in this together  beyond caring for our own families greenfingered types are sharing produce with their neighbours a survey commissioned by the british charity rsa cited that 42 of respondents feel the outbreak has made them value food more and 10 have shared supplies for the first time  i first noticed the neighbourly potential of plants three weeks after lockdown had begun when a neighbour i hardly knew knocked on the door of my house in suffolk when i answered she leapt behind the gate “alpine strawberries” she yelled “plant them in partial shade” a week later a trio of pepper seedlings appeared – another gift to say thank you i delivered fat garlicky leaves of wild ransom foraged between bluebells in a nearby woodland now we swap excited texts about her egglaying tortoise rosie since then i check what jeanie and her husband john would like from the shops why i waited for a pandemic to do this is beyond me  outside their gate a sign offers willowherb and more wild strawberries – anything surplus they don’t need “if someone likes something in your garden you can just take a cutting for them” john said “it doesn’t cost you anything”  the bristol seed swap has been promoting the circular economy of seed saving for years a few days after lockdown they advertised leftover seed packets from a previous event which the public could request free of charge by sending a selfaddressed stamped envelope diane holness a spokesperson for the nonprofit said swells of gardeners were in touch with requests “we sent seeds to around 150 people” she said “i think everyone is aware that food prices are going up and that fresh produce is going to be at a premium”  the most requested seeds were tomato adaptable and easy to grow “i think they are one crop that can fit into even the tiniest space even a balcony” she said  luckily the organisation had plenty as holness said harvesting seeds costs you nothing but goes a long way to helping someone else “if you know how you could almost save enough cabbage seeds for everyone in the city”  two hours west of bristol west dorset’s foodie capital bridport has been a hive of activity since lockdown created in response to quarantine the bridport grow your own community facebook group has played a large role in greening the town just as the 1930s dig for victory leaflets relayed growing information online groups are helping new growers by circulating plant wisdom  “as a town i think we are all at it” environmentalist and educator kim squirrel told me “people have dug up their gardens and others are growing in pots” she works a private allotment on the town’s edge shared between 10 houses that includes her neighbour rachel millson both have turned their full attention to growing with news of the lockdown squirrel’s potager garden is crammed with brassicas alongside beans french to dwarf winding up bamboo stalks that are also homegrown pear and espalier apple trees will fruit come the summer  millson’s garden exploits are equally impressive overwintering crops such as earthy beetroot onion and leeks fill up one plot another bed is an experiment in perennial vegetables such as asparagus that take less carbon from the soil  “the pandemic has cemented in my mind the need to be growing more food not just for my own family and to save money but for the wider community” millson said  she feels fortunate to have an allotment but wishes there was more recognition that growing your own food isn’t just a pastime but “real important work” millson strongly believes it has personal benefits and also aids community wellbeing preempting that food inequality is going to be at an alltime high she has purposefully grown extra vegetable crops with a mind to donate them to a local foodbank  part of the fun of growing your own produce is in sharing your hardearned bounty with family and friends but while delivering your overzealous courgette crop is practical there is something special in giving someone a plant they can cultivate themselves  we have common ground now something other than the fear around the pandemic  bruno white had just moved to ditcheat somerset when the uk went into lockdown on 23 march he wrote to his new neighbours to introduce himself and set up an informal mutual aid group one elderly gentleman he shopped for was so grateful that he left a collection of plants on white’s doorstep each with handwritten instructions shortly afterwards another thankful neighbour gifted him packets of biodynamic seeds “he taught us about three sisters its a traditional native american method you grow corn then beans to climb up it then squash to shade and stifle any weeds”  white has since been cultivating his garden and has been surprised at how easy it is – and how kind his neighbours are “we have common ground now something other than the fear around the pandemic” he said  while the early days of the covid19 pandemic were filled with panic hopefully it will be the incredible displays of neighbourly spirit that we will remember the victory garden movement of the world wars not only helped strengthen communities but also gave homebound individuals a chance to contribute to those fighting on the front line amid a pandemic the vegetable garden has similar appeal it offers a sustainable solution to food security that not only helps us but allows us to care for our neighbours too  at a time of uncertainty and confusion even planting a lettuce seed can offer a semblance of hope  neighbourly love is an uplifting

317,the remarkable power of the prickly pear,the landscape could be one straight from a postcard of a mexican desert with strong sun almost directly overhead a green field of cacti cover the dusty surroundings of camémbaro a farming community in the state of michoacan nopal as this type of ovalleafed plant is known all over the country does not only grow in these lands also known as the prickly pear it can be found all over the mesoamerican region and it is so emblematic that it has a prime spot on mexico’s national flag it is regularly consumed as salad or in healthy shakes or in less virtuous tortillas and nacho chips the inedible waste products are normally discarded but in this town after the cactus had given all it can as a food people saw the potential of turning this waste into a new fuel source  in 2009 local businessman rogelio sosa lopez had already succeeded in the cornmade tortilla industry and partnered with miguel angel ake to found nopalimex a company that grows cacti as a cheaper alternative to corn they found that nopal crops produce between 300 and 400 tonnes of biomass per hectare in less fertile lands and up to 8001000 tonnes in richer soils nopal also requires minimum water consumption and its waste if properly processed can be turned into biofuel  “we are sowing nopal for three reasons the first one is social – it creates jobs and prevents emigration secondly from an economic perspective it reduces the cost of industrial processing of nopalbased products lastly and most importantly there is an environmental reason” says ake the hope is that biofuel from nopal can be a viable alternative to fossil fuels in the region  you might also like  ake started to explore biofuels more than 40 years ago but he began to experiment with cacti in 2007 now his company is producing enough fuel for the buildings that process all parts of the nopal plant in a sustainable way but he plans to go further he has already signed a commitment with the local government of zitacuaro in the state of michoacan to provide official vehicles from police cars to ambulances with cactusbased fuel  “with the amount of nopal we have in mexico and a productivity of over 100 tonnes of gas per acre we believe that this could eventually replace the traditional use of gas and fuel of nonrenewable sources” he says  the process is relatively simple first the cacti are cut and processed to extract flour which is used to make tortilla chips the remaining inedible scraps of the plant are mixed with cow dung in a bioprocessor a fermentation tank that heats the wasted cactus pulp then the fuel is distilled from the remaining liquid and collected via tubes and into a tank
318,the wild animals at risk in lockdown,pictures of smogfree skies and videos of lions and hyenas strutting across fairways could easily lead you to believe that nature is thriving during the coronavirus pandemic for some species lockdown may indeed be good news for many other wild animals however that couldn’t be further from the truth  that’s because lockdown means many things in the cities of rich countries it means less traffic on the roads and less pollution which can give wildlife space to thrive but in rural parts of poor countries it means some people are being driven to extremes to support themselves through poaching  “what we’re seeing is an incredible impact on nature because millions of people are suddenly unemployed and they have nothing to fall back on” says joseph walston head of global conservation at the wildlife conservation society in new york city “in places like southeast asia there’s this huge urbantorural migration where people have lost their jobs in the cities overnight they’re now having to depend on poaching logging or other activities that are degrading nature because they have no other option”  you might also like  there have also been reports of a surge in bushmeat poaching in kenya and other parts of africa as well as cambodia according to the nonprofit conservation international in africa’s rural areas one driver of this surge is the challenge people are facing in finding their next meal “during lockdown people can’t go to work especially those in the informal market – who rely on going out every single day to make ends meet and come back with some food” says michael o’brienonyeka senior vicepresident of conservation international’s africa field division “for example the guy in the rural area who has to take out his motorbike taxi to go out and pick passengers to make a few bucks – he can’t do that anymore”

321,can the ‘centenarian olympics’ help you live longer,attia came up with a list of 18 things he wanted to do when he turned 100 he then chose exercises like a 30pound goblet squat to mimic those activities and called them his “centenarian olympics” attia’s ‘events’ replicate everyday tasks like carrying groceries up flights of stairs putting a suitcase in an overhead bin and getting off the floor with a single point of support – all things that attia believes will help him prepare to live the life he wants to at 100 even though the events comprise ability a young athlete might for granted they’re challenges for a centuryold body  that’s why attia wants to start practising now  ‘never too late’  of course not everyone lives for a century  “despite all the preparation and trying to prevent diseases there’s no guarantee to reach 100” says george leeson the director of the oxford institute of population ageing but he adds strength is key to staying physically independent later in life “the research would suggest that even minor improvements in muscular strength will let us maintain independence and strength and push back frailty and instability in a person”  as we age our bodies start to lose muscle mass and bone density research shows that people can lose up to 5 of their muscle mass every decade after the age of 30 lost muscle mass can be regained through training and leeson says studies have shown men tend to retain more muscle mass than women the solution is to stay active build muscle as early as possible and focus on maintaining it  “ideally from birth we should prepare to live to 100” says leeson “of course the earlier one starts to maintain muscle mass the stronger one will be later in life and the easier it will be to maintain but it’s never too late to start”  still even though the body changes are gradual there are harsh moments when people realise they can’t do things they easily did when they were younger for wilder this moment came on when she was doing one of things she loves most travelling “i was having a hard time lifting a suitcase into an overhead rack and realised that’s a disability the inability to do something i used to do” says wilder “disability sneaks up on people”

339,coronavirus can we stay safe as lockdown eases,image copyright getty images image caption the new research suggests coughs and sneezes might project liquid further than previously thought  as lockdowns are eased all over the world what are the risks of getting infected as people come into closer contact with each other  its a question that scientists have been exploring in a variety of settings including restaurants and offices  frustratingly the evidence for how the virus can be transmitted is often slim and if the answers seem vague its because the science is uncertain  it comes amid pressure from businesses such as pubs to be allowed to reopen  but the influence is also coming from people wondering if the rules are too strict  what are the key factors  the most obvious is distance  research that began in the 1930s showed that when someone coughs most of the droplets they release either evaporate or fall to the ground within about one metre  thats why the world health organization who settled on its one metre rule for social distancing  some governments have opted for a safer limit of 15m with the uk and others preferring an even more cautious 2m  the guidance essentially means that the further youre apart the safer you ought to be but its not distance alone that matters  the second key factor is timing  how long youre close to someone  image copyright reuters image caption the uk government has adopted a 2m rule for social distancing  the uk governments advice is that spending six seconds with an infected person 1m away carries the same risk as spending one minute with them if theyre 2m away  and where its not possible to keep your distance from a colleague the aim is to limit the time together to 15 minutes  but as well as timing theres another important issue ventilation  being outside carries the least risk because any virus released by someone infected will be diluted in the breeze  that doesnt mean the possibility of transmission is zero  even out of doors the uks official advice is to stay 2m apart and if youre closer try not to talk facetoface  but inside where there isnt much fresh air and where people might be close together for longer the chances of becoming infected are obviously greater  what are the risks indoors in a restaurant  a fascinating insight comes from a study in the chinese city of guangzhou which tracked how a cluster of infections occurred  sitting at tables that were one metre apart people were having a meal last january  one of the diners was infected with coronavirus but hadnt realised because they had no symptoms  but in the following days another nine people whod been in the restaurant at the time came down with covid19  including five whod been sitting at other tables several metres away  scientists investigating the infections reached a conclusion about the most likely route of transmission that droplets containing the virus  released by the infected person  were circulated by air conditioning  the key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow their study says blaming two air conditioning units mounted high on a wall  this is not proof that the virus can be spread this way but the research certainly suggests that it is a plausible route  and if confirmed it would mean that in any room with a similar system of ventilation even moving tables more than one metre apart would still not guarantee to keep people safe  what do we know about the effect of ventilation  to try to understand the risks a team from the university of oregon specialising in the study of microbes in buildings simulated different types of ventilation in a restaurant  in one scenario someone at a corner table coughs without covering their mouth and releases droplets and particles that are projected through the air  the largest droplets land on their own table  thats what youd expect with the whos one metre rule  image copyright university of oregon image caption computer modelling by the university of oregon showing the potential spread of coronavirus in a restaurant with an air conditioning unit  but smaller ones reach beyond the immediate area and are caught in a current of air coming from an air conditioning unit at the other end of the room  the result is similar to whats thought to have happened in the restaurant in guangzhou tiny droplets and particles are spread to people at other tables  as with that study this simulation doesnt prove that the coronavirus can be transmitted this way or if it did that it would make anyone ill  that depends on whether the virus is still active after being blown across the room and on whether the person receiving it gets a large enough dose  but the possibility of infection cant be ruled out  according kevin van den wymelenberg professor of architecture at the university of oregon who led the study the virus can be spread further than people might realise  what can be done to make restaurants safer  the oregon team simulated another scenario in the same restaurant in which theres an open window beside the person who coughs and an extractor vent on the opposite wall  this time the cloud of droplets and particles is not pushed around the room but instead travels in a fairly direct line from window to vent with the result that fewer people are caught in it  a flow of fresh air to dilute the virus is one of several techniques highlighted by the team as options for managing covid19  image copyright university of oregon image caption the simulations showed how fresh air from an open window could carry the virus to a vent  its really impossible to completely eliminate risk says prof van den wymelenberg but what we showed was a concept for how you could reduce transmission  the good news is that there are things you can do to make safer spaces  in addition to bringing in fresh air through windows or mechanical ventilation other options include improving the standard of filtration and also humidifying the air  moist conditions might encourage droplets to sink to the floor  what does this mean on planes  social distancing isnt likely to be possible  unless the aircraft is half empty  and by definition youll be in close contact with others for more than 15 minutes  so on the basis of those two key factors the risks may well be higher the question of ventilation is more debatable  on the one hand the air in the cabin is constantly circulated so if someone coughs even a few rows away there is a chance the infection will be spread  on the other hand modern aircraft filter the cabin air every few minutes and to a high standard  what about the risks at work  in factories and offices social distancing may be harder to follow  dr julian tang of the university of leicester has come up an easy breath test to check if youre too close to colleagues  a consultant virologist at leicester royal infirmary hes studied how the air is moved when people speak and concludes that something as simple as a conversation could pass the virus  if you can smell your friends breath  the garlic or curry or alcohol  youre inhaling what theyre breathing out  and if youre inhaling enough of that air to smell it then youre close enough to inhale any virus thats also carried in the air with it  so how can transmission take place  so far the public advice has focused on whats called the droplet route someone coughing or sneezing into the eyes nose or mouth of a person nearby which has led to the social distancing rules  its also highlighted a second route  surfaces  in which a person whos infected passes on the virus through contact either directly by shaking hands or by exhaling over surfaces like kitchen worktops  image copyright hexagonmsc image caption modelling by hexagonmsc software showing how an infected person could pass the virus to a fellow passenger on a train  others then get the contamination on their hands directly or by using the same space at work or at home  which is why handwashing is so important  but theres a third possibility as well  tiny droplets or particles being carried in the air by speech for example and that roite might be the most important according to dr tang  when youre talking to a colleague you dont touch them you dont spit on them most of the interaction is by voice and breathing  all of which

342,huawei what would happen if the uk ditched the chinese firm,image copyright getty images  huaweis future in the uk is in doubt  again  the consequences could affect how quickly improved internet access is rolled out and how much it will cost this a time when the countrys economy is already in a precarious state because of the coronavirus pandemic  the catalyst for a potential rethink is the uss move to restrict the firms ability to buy chips which was justified on national security grounds  on sunday the uks national security centre ncsc confirmed it was examining what impact this would have on the uk networks that use huaweis tech  that sounds quite vague but it potentially paves the way for a government uturn  in january the prime minister gave the green light to continued use of the firms tech in mobile and broadband networks but said its its market share must be reduced  now he might appreciate the chance for change of mind  it would help boris johnson prevent backbenchers who favour a ban from derailing his forthcoming telecoms infrastructure bill  moreover it offers him a way to defuse tensions with the white house which has said continued use of huawei will have a dramatic impact on our ability to share security information  mr johnson and president trump may meet next month at a mooted g7 summit blocking huawei could help secure a postbrexit trade deal even if it made relations with china trickier  image copyright pa media image caption boris johnson may meet donald trump at the us presidents camp david retreat at a proposed g7 summit  but the company warns there would be consequences  more suppliers means greater competition innovation and network reliability and crucially ensures consumers have access to the best possible technology victor zhang huaweis uk chief told the bbc  removing huawei would seriously delay 5g costing the british economy up to £7bn he added citing a study published last year by mobile uk a trade group that represents uk network operators  time consuming  part of the reason mobile providers are concerned is that the current version of 5g relies on new equipment being plugged into existing 4g kit from the same vendor  a lot of the 4g expansion was softwareupgradeable to do 5g when an extra mast antenna was fitted explained andrew ferguson editorinchief of the news site thinkbroadband  so he added even if a huawei ban was limited to the newer technology networks would still have to rip out and replace some of their older infrastructure as well  image copyright huawei image caption huawei has sold 5g equipment all over the world  its not only a very expensive process for the operators but its going to be a timeconsuming one as well because they need to get access to all those sites to make the changes added matthew howett from assembly the consultancy that wrote mobile uks report  and huawei has been very innovative at coming up with the smallest and lightest 5g equipment meaning the operators can sometimes just use a cherry picker to hook it onto existing mast infrastructure some of the others is heavier and bulkier which can require more in terms of getting planning consent and road closures  huaweis major 5g rivals are nokia and ericsson  two european firms  the networks claim that having three providers to choose from helps them negotiate lower prices  in many cases they want a mix of two suppliers so that if technical problems arise with one they can fall back on the other to provide a reduced service that doesnt always involve huawei  o2 for instance picked nokia and ericsson to be its primary 5g vendors despite having trialled the chinese firms kit  a study commissioned by huawei last year claimed locking it out would increase a countrys 5g investment costs by between 8 and 29 due to reduced competition  and if mobile providers have to spend more consumers can expect their bills to rise too  but one mp opposed to huaweis rollout says there are more important considerations  theres a free and fair competition element here theres a security element theres a dataprivacy element and theres a sort of geopolitics of chinese influence as well  the influence of the chinese communist party bob seely a member of the foreign affairs committee told the bbc  there shouldnt on principle be highrisk vendors in the communications network  huawei denies it uses state subsidies to undercut its rivals adding that it would never spy on chinas behalf or otherwise deliberately compromise its clients  home broadband  huawei is also a big player in fixedline broadband  it currently accounts for about 44 of the equipment used in providing superfast fullfibre connections directly to homes office and other buildings according to uk regulator ofcom  bts openreach division aims to bring that in line with a 35 government target by using more kit from nokia and the us firm adtran  but this sidesteps the fact that more properties rely on an alternative setup in which fibre only reaches roadside cabinets and the last leg is supplied by a copperbased connection the reason this is relevant is that tens of thousands of the cabinets involved are huaweis  image copyright getty images image caption many of the fibre broadband cabinets are filled with equipment sold by huawei  they connect directly to the core of the network commented mr ferguson  but replacing those is a complete nonstarter unless someones going to throw many billions of pounds at it and also all the people to do the work  while huaweis opponents would prefer it to be gone altogether they acknowledge this is impractical in the short term  but mr seely suggested that cabinets and other such products should be swapped out for alternatives when they are up for replacement  one thing practically everyone agrees on is that the matter needs to be settled once and for at a time when so much else about the economy is uncertain  these procurement decisions can take 18 months to two years to finalise and it takes time to ramp up supply to meet the demand said mr howett  so this isnt just a question of overnight deciding not to use huawei  it would take many years to do it properly
343,find out which masks off the most protection and why,image copyright uhsft image caption facemasks in use at university hospital southampton  while paper and cloth masks may help controlling the spread of covid19 amongst the general public theyre certainly not up to the mark for use in intensive care  here where the risk of infection is at its greatest medical staff need personal protective equipment of a far higher standard capable of shielding them completely from the virus  the simplest form of face covering is the surgical mask generally made of three layers of paper or cloth theyre resistant to droplets such as those caused by coughing or sneezing but give little protection against viral particles themselves which are only around 100 nanometres in size a nanometre being a billionth of a metre  a mask which goes over your nose and mouth but doesnt fit tightly to your face is really there to be a barrier for any particles that you might expel explains dr nikki mccullough head of safety for 3m one of the worlds biggest suppliers of respiratory protection the mask isnt going to prevent you from breathing in very small particles  image copyright getty images image caption medical staff working in intensive care need the highestrated masks  respirators on the other hand are designed to fit tightly to the face so that no air can leak in or out and require a rigorous fitting process  when you breathe in all the air goes through the filter media and that filter media has been tested to a performance standard says dr mccullough so you can be sure that if you get a good seal to your face the respirator is reducing the number of particles that youre going to breathe into your lungs  respirators come in various different forms the simplest being masklike filtering facepiece ffp respirators some are designed to be disposable whereas others can be disinfected and reused  more technology of business  in the us ffp respirators are classified by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh in terms of the percentage of particles they filter out thus n95 and n99 masks filter out 95 and 99 of particles respectively while n100 devices eliminate 9997  in europe respirators are classified slightly differently respirators rated ffp1 filter out at least 80 of particles ffp2s remove at least 94 and ffp3 devices correspond to n100 by filtering out at least 9997  meanwhile similar to an ffp3 mask in effectiveness but certainly not in appearance are diving helmetstyle powered air purifying respirators paprs  there you have a more comprehensive solution theres a hood face shield and a tube that would connect into a unit on the belt says brian hovey chief marketing officer for major respirator manufacturer honeywell  image copyright honeywell image caption respirators are available with a range of filtering levels  that has an engine or a motor that pumps air through a filter its part of a white suit so its a more comprehensive protective solution  at the university of southampton engineers have developed a papr that theyre supplying to university hospital southampton  1000 are already in use  its currently undergoing the official rating and approval process so its not yet in use in intensive care or triage where ffp3 respirators are required however two firms are making them and 5000 have been ordered for staff in other settings  the testing process involved both a smell test to see whether the wearer could detect outside smells as well as a physical test of whether tiny particles are indeed filtered out  we put a petri dish inside the hood and another one outside and delivered 1000 litres of air through the filter explains alex dickinson an associate professor in the universitys bioengineering science research group  we incubated them for 24 hours at 37c and then counted how many of these colonyforming units had been transmitted through the filter and hood on our first experiment we saw no units of bacterial growth inside the hood but ten formed on the control plate outside  the british standards institute is currently evaluating the device against european standards after which hopes the team it can be used more widely at southampton and elsewhere  your vision is much better and your communication is better as the patient can see your whole face your efficiency is much better as you can move from patient to patient without putting on and taking off your ppe says hospital consultant and professor in respiratory medicine paul elkington  image copyright persos image caption a mask developed by the university of southampton is under production  once we started rolling it out one of the healthcare assistants said to me ive been feeling sick with nerves about coming in but now i feel secure  until recently the market for respirators was mainly industrial  manufacturing construction and the like  if we look at six months ago with fullface respirators  ffp2s and ffp3s  demand from healthcare was very low says dr mccullough they really only used them for tuberculosis maybe a measles case but now we see that healthcare everywhere in the world is using respirators at a much much higher rate  as a result manufacturers have been working flat out to increase capacity to meet the new demand  weve made significant investment in both ramping up capacity at our existing facilities as well as new facilities most notably in the us weve just had our first products coming off the line in our smithfield rhode island facility and we hit 500000 units earlier this past week says honeywells brian hovey  similarly weve ramped up our build capacity and were starting to get product out in phoenix these new facilities are adding about 20 million units per month and were evaluating potential new facilities around the globe  image copyright honeywell image caption honeywell has boosted production of masks  dr mccullough says that 3m is also increasing production adding extra shifts and improving efficiency  we can make the same products but more quickly we are adding new lines and we are looking at some small changes to certain products looking at new headbands for example she says  so will the global supply hold up  in the immediate term probably not unfortunately  the uptick weve seen has been unprecedented and depending on how people are thinking of them as a consumer product demand far outstrips global supply says mr hovey  but he adds were having a good dialogue with governments around preparing for the future and we make sure that strategic stockpiles are adequately supplied  if  god forbid  another situation like this occurs collectively well be able to respond quickly and effectively

350,coronavirus not just any retail recession,image copyright pa media  where theres a crisis theres an opportunity to drive reform ms is used to being in crisis and the new mantra is never the same again its a road others can be expected to take  there are high costs to managing garment stocks but dont be surprised to see this years spring ranges return next year  the retailers boss is making permanent moves to more flexible staffing accelerating store closures and pushing for lower rent while lockdown has shown him he can delegate while stripping out head office jobs  never miss the opportunity of a big crisis goes the advice marks  spencer starts with a big advantage  its already very used to being in crisis  with its annual results its boss has seized on the opportunity to push further and faster than he was already doing  its a ploy you can expect other business leaders to adopt so it may be of interest to see how steve rowe is going about it  the striking thing about this onetime flagship of british retail is that it has survived being in crisis for so long thats partly because the ms food business has done at least ok in navigating changes to the grocery market  it has invested for instance in smaller outlets at locations with a big foodtogo footfall  notably at railway stations thats causing it some pain at the moment with so few rail travellers  food has helped support it through a perpetual state of crisis with its clothing and home ranges criticised for being too frumpy it has chopped and changed its design teams its store design its buying strategy its marketing and even when it got things right it didnt order enough stock  chief executive steve rowe says the turnaround strategy was on track a 2 drop in revenue in the year to march isnt bad by ms standards even though pretax profits are down 21  never the same again  but clearly the garment trade is now in a horrible mess holding stock for summer that it cant sell with an appetite for online sales sharply down and no clarity about when it can get back to normal business  the scottish retail consortium figures for april are out and they make predictably dire reading inflation is down to only 08 and at risk of heading into deflation which would be a bigger nightmare for retailers if consumers have an expectation that prices will keep falling then they hold off purchases  mr rowes message to investors and staff is to take £1bn of actions for the short term including £100m less late summer stock on order £50m down on marketing £40m saved by freezing recruitment and pay £40m less on technology £60m through ordering less stock £50m saved by furloughing staff and £140m less capital spend  some £400m of stock is not seasonal so it stays on the shelves £200m of spring stock will be put in warehouses for next year extra costs for changes in stocking £145m  image copyright getty images  note that a lot of that is bad news for the supply chain in this country and for overseas garment workers its better news if youre renting warehouse space  beyond the short term ms has a new mantra never the same again steve rowe says it is learning lessons of a smaller nimbler top team delegated decisions with working groups and committees disbanded  staff have improvised and learned to multitask instore and in support roles microsoft teams software is a key relationship buying policy is focussed on stocking more of less from fewer core suppliers  it seems all that is going to remain in place that saves cost and costs mean jobs central support costs and headcount will be examined at all levels  lending conditions  transformation plans get accelerated and that means changes to supply chains decisions are made closer to the supplier which is often overseas while more will be nearsourced for online seasonal products that need quick turnaround  ms wants to vacate older underperforming store locations and is joining other retailers in a hardbargaining drive to lower rent levels  commercial landlords wont be at all surprised intu a shopping mall giant which owns braehead shopping centre in southwest glasgow told its creditors this week to brace for their lending conditions to be broken as rents simply arent paid the implicit message if you collapse this business good luck finding another one that can work the asset any better  says steve rowe at ms whilst some customer habits will return to normal others have changed forever the trend towards digital has been accelerated and changes to the shape of the high street brought forward  most importantly working habits have been transformed and we have discovered we can work in a faster leaner more effective way i am determined to act now to capture this and deliver a renewed more agile business in a world that will never be the same again  going concern or gone  talking of business strategy one of the most awkward decisions facing company directors and auditors in the next few months is going to be signing off on accounts the going concern statement is meant to reassure creditors and investors that the business will still be around in 12 months  without a going concern signature the red light starts flashing at your bank branch so its definitely preferable to have one  in current circumstances and for many companies getting from here to this time next year is not at all certain  so the institute of chartered accountants in scotland is today offering updated guidelines you might hope it would offer some reassurance  instead its chief executive bruce cartwright says directors should consider the specific facts and circumstances of their company in determining the extent of the procedures to be undertaken when forming the going concern assessment whilst being cognisant of wider macroeconomic conditions  reassured by that no me neither what does it mean well with no specialist qualification in such matters my interpretation is ca canny dont just hope for the best and this is

352,climate change scientists fear car surge will see co2 rebound,image copyright pa media  daily global emissions of co2 fell by 17 at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to covid19 say scientists  the most comprehensive account yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys  but the authors are worried that as people return to work car use will soar again  they fear co2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis  they are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real durable changes on transport and personal mobility  in the uk transport secretary grant shapps has pledged £250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure other countries are also looking at similar plans  the lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to covid19 have had a significant impact on the carbonproducing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do  road transport has declined hugely as has aviation  however now that the uk is beginning to return to work mr shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport should walking or cycling not be an option  if you cant walk or cycle but you do have access to a car please use it rather than travelling by bus train or tram he said  industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed  now in detailed analysis researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of co2  theyve calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97 of global emissions  during the peak of the crisis in early april daily emissions dropped by 17 compared to the previous year meaning around 17 million tonnes less co2 were emitted every day  the key to the fall has been cars surface transport emissions have declined by 43 the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined  while the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact it only accounts for 10 of the decrease during the pandemic  china has been responsible for the biggest drop followed by the us europe and india  if some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year then global emissions will likely drop by 7  if prepandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by midjune the annual fall would be around 4  but the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound especially on the roads could see a carbon surge  analysis  roger harrabin environment analyst  lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants too one of the uks leading experts prof frank kelly from kings college london said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised  fully two years before us authorities exposed the scandal  he told radio 4s the life scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road  prof kelly said he reported it to the department for environment food and rural affairs defra but they didnt publish his findings he said work undertaken subsequently in the us led to legal action against car makers that had installed defeat devices to fool regulators  the government didnt deny the account a spokesperson said we are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our clean air strategy has been commended by the world health organization as an example for the rest of the world to follow  meanwhile on the covid19 crisis he said levels of the pollutant no2 had fallen by up to 60 in london since the fall in traffic under lockdown  levels of another pollutant sooty particles remained at harmful concentrations  a big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before once everybody goes back said prof corinne le quéré from the university of east anglia who led the analysis  the researchers say that fundamental systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change  when it comes to transportation there are huge opportunities according to prof le quéré  she says that after the global financial crisis in 2008 some governments like china us and germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables  image copyright getty images image caption airlines have been hit hard economically but the slowdown in flying hasnt hugely impacted emissions  here now in 2020 were very close to the same situation in electric mobility she told bbc news  battery prices have come down we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies  so if these two things can align then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow  grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change  a letter signed by 155 major companies representing 24 trillion £196 trillion in market capitalisation calls for a netzero emissions response to the covid crisis  corporations including carlsberg iberdrola edf and coca cola europe say they want governments to prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy  image copyright getty images image caption electric cars may be the best way forward for transportation scientists believe  the authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action they point to the fact that while emissions of co2 may be temporarily reduced all the while co2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere warming the planet  it will take a a dramatic shift to change that  i think very much that we are at a crossroads and at this point like the uk prime minister boris johnson said it could go either way  he was talking about his own health but here were talking about the health of the planet  it could go either way  the study

355,coronavirus can india replace china as worlds factory,image copyright getty images image caption india feels chinas weakened global position could be a blessing in disguise  with covid19 infecting millions across the world china is facing an unprecedented global backlash that could destabilise its reign as the worlds factory of choice  its neighbour india has sensed an opportunity and is keen to make inroads to a space it hopes china will vacate sooner rather than later  chinas weakened global position is a blessing in disguise for india to attract more investment transport minister nitin gadkari said in a recent interview the northern state of uttar pradesh which has a population the size of brazil is already forming an economic task force to attract firms keen to ditch china  india is also readying a pool of land twice the size of luxembourg to offer companies that want to move manufacturing out of china and has reached out to 1000 american multinationals bloomberg reported  this outreach has been an ongoing process deepak bagla chief executive of invest india the governments national investment promotion agency told the bbc covid will only accelerate the process of derisking from china for many of these companies  the usindia business council usibc a powerful lobby group that works to enhance investment flows between india and the us also said that india has significantly stepped up its pitch  we are seeing india prioritise efforts to attract supply chains both at central and state government level nisha biswal president of usibc and the former assistant secretary of state for south and central asian affairs in the us department of state told the bbc  companies that already have some manufacturing in india may be earlier movers in reducing output in plants in china and scaling up in production in india  image copyright getty images image caption indian government agencies are trying to woo multinationals from the us  but things are still at an evaluation stage and decisions are unlikely to be made in a hurry she added  in an environment where global balance sheets are fractured relocating entire supply chains is easier said than done  many of these companies are facing severe cash and capital constraints because of the pandemic and will therefore be very cautious before making quick moves independent economist rupa subramanya said  according to rahul jacob a longtime china watcher and former financial times bureau chief in hong kong the indian government putting together land banks is a step in the right direction but large companies are unlikely to move their operations just because land is made available  production lines and supply chains are far more sticky than most people seem to understand it is very difficult to pull them apart overnight he said  china offers integrated infrastructure like large ports and highways top quality labour and sophisticated logistics all of which are critical factors to meet strict deadlines that international companies operate on  image copyright getty images image caption can india match chinas integrated infrastructure capabilities  another reason india might not be the obvious choice for global multinationals is because it isnt well integrated with major global supply chains  last year delhi pulled out of a crucial multilateral trade agreement with 12 other asian countries collectively known as the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep despite seven years of negotiations decisions like these make it difficult for indian exporters to benefit from tarifffree access to destination markets or offer reciprocity to its trading partners  why would i make something that i want to sell to singapore in india being connected in trade agreements institutionally is as important as offering competitive prices parag khanna author of the future is asian told the bbc  regional integration is particularly crucial he believes as global trade begins to follow the sell where you make model where companies socalled nearsource rather than outsource production and bring it closer to demand  indias volatile relationship with foreign direct investment fdi and uneven regulation is also something that continues to bother global companies  from prohibiting ecommerce companies to sell nonessential items and tweaking fdi rules to disallow easier capital flows from neighbouring countries the fear is that india has used the pandemic to build protectionist walls around itself  in a recent address to the nation indian prime minister narendra modi made be vocal for local his rallying cry new stimulus proposals meanwhile have increased thresholds for foreign companies bidding for indian contracts  the more that india can improve regulatory stability the better its chances of persuading more global businesses to establish hubs in india says mr biswal  so then who if not india  as things stand vietnam bangladesh south korea and taiwan seem to be favourites to benefit from the backlash against china the latter two at the hightech end of the spectrum and vietnam and bangladesh at the lower end according to mr jacob  image copyright getty images image caption president trump has blamed china for not doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus  multinationals began moving production out of china into these countries nearly a decade ago due to rising labour and environmental costs the slow exodus has only gathered pace as uschina trade tensions have increased in recent years  since june 2018 a month before the trade war began us goods imports from vietnam have soared by more than 50 and those from taiwan by 30 according to calculations made by the south china morning post newspaper  india is seen to have lost out because it failed to create conditions allowing multinationals to supply not only the local market but also to use the country as a production base to export to the world  in recent weeks several states have begun making moves to address some concerns around the ease of doing business  prime among them being making contentious changes to indias archaic labour laws put in place to reduce exploitation  uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh states for instance have suspended significant labour protections exempting factories from even maintaining basic requirements like cleanliness ventilation lighting and toilets  image copyright getty images image caption some indian states have stripped away laws that gave labourers basic protections  the intention is to improve the investment climate and attract global capital  but such decisions could become counterproductive and hurt rather than help says mr jacob international companies would be very wary about this they have strict codes of conduct on labour environment and safety standards for suppliers  the 2013 collapse of the rana plaza garment factory in bangladesh that supplied retailers like walmart was a turning point it forced bangladesh to significantly improve factory infrastructure and safety to clinch more investment he cautions  india has to follow better standards these are white board ideas drafted on powerpoint by bureaucrats who are completely divorced from the reality of global trade  but with the us weighing punitive action against china japan paying its corporations to move out of the country and uk lawmakers coming under pressure to reconsider their decision to allow chinese telecoms giant huawei a role in building the countrys new 5g data network global antichina sentiment is increasing  the time is ripe say experts for india to undertake broadbased structural reforms and use these sweeping geopolitical shifts to modify its trading relationship with the world

the coronavirus lockdown is a significant problem  with everyone except key workers being asked to stay at home from 23 march greencore suddenly saw a vast drop in customer numbers  supplying ownbrand sandwiches to all the major supermarkets and staff canteens  overnight there was hardly anybody in the uks offices and other workplaces to pop out in their lunchbreak and buy a blt or egg mayo  as a result greencore says its main food to go division which usually sells 700 million sandwiches per year plus salads and sushi saw sales slump by 70 over the following month and a half  image copyright

of unprecedented uncertainty and in an interview with irish broadcaster rte he said it made previous worries about brexit seem very trivial  in response to coronavirus greencore has shut three of its 16 uk facilities and furloughed 4000 of its 11500 employees patrick and his fellow board members have cut their own pay by 30  he says he is proud of the staff that have remained in work making sandwiches that include the thousands given for free to nhs workers across 20 uk hospitals  our people have been working around the clock to ensure that we can continue to provide high quality fresh prepared food to both consumers and frontline workers during the pandemic  born in the republic of ireland in 1971 the 49yearold is from a celebrated irish family that is sometimes referred to as the

spending a decade at management consultants mckinsey before he joined greencore in 2005 as chief financial officer  greencore had been set up in 1991 following the privatisation of the former stateowned irish sugar it moved into convenience foods in 2001 before completely exiting the sugar business in 2006 in 2011 it switched its primary listing from the irish stock exchange to london  while making sandwiches is the bulk of its business it also produces a range of chilled prepared meals  everything from curries to quiches and soups the company says sales of these in first six weeks of the lockdown were higher than last year as people did more cooking at home however the rise was only as much as 5  image copyright marc haydon image caption greencore also makes everything from quiches to yorkshire puddings  although coronavirus is a challenge for greencore it is not the first major problem patrick has had to deal with at the company in 2008 only three months after he was promoted to chief executive a £15m fraud was discovered at the companys scottish water subsidiary campsie  patrick sacked three senior managers over the scandal it was he says the most challenging moment of his professional life and that it made him stronger and more determined as person and as a leader  retail analyst nick widdowson founder of shopper first says that looking forward a major issue facing greencore and other makers of convenience food is how to reduce or remove the plastic packaging  providing ethically fresh authentic locally sourced product together with sustainable packaging will be key to any producer of convenience foods seeking to meet their consumers changing expectations he says  image copyright brian pickering image caption the firm has temporarily closed

391,coronavirus can we stay safe as lockdown eases,image copyright getty images image caption the new research suggests coughs and sneezes might project liquid further than previously thought  as lockdowns are eased all over the world what are the risks of getting infected as people come into closer contact with each other  its a question that scientists have been exploring in a variety of settings including restaurants and offices  frustratingly the evidence for how the virus can be transmitted is often slim and if the answers seem vague its because the science is uncertain  it comes amid pressure from businesses such as pubs to be allowed to reopen  but the influence is also coming from people wondering if the rules are too strict  what are the key factors  the most obvious is distance  research that began in the 1930s showed that when someone coughs most of the droplets they release either evaporate or fall to the ground within about one metre  thats why the world health organization who settled on its one metre rule for social distancing  some governments have opted for a safer limit of 15m with the uk and others preferring an even more cautious 2m  the guidance essentially means that the further youre apart the safer you ought to be but its not distance alone that matters  the second key factor is timing  how long youre close to someone  image copyright reuters image caption the uk government has adopted a 2m rule for social distancing  the uk governments advice is that spending six seconds with an infected person 1m away carries the same risk as spending one minute with them if theyre 2m away  and where its not possible to keep your distance from a colleague the aim is to limit the time together to 15 minutes  but as well as timing theres another important issue ventilation  being outside carries the least risk because any virus released by someone infected will be diluted in the breeze  that doesnt mean the possibility of transmission is zero  even out of doors the uks official advice is to stay 2m apart and if youre closer try not to talk facetoface  but inside where there isnt much fresh air and where people might be close together for longer the chances of becoming infected are obviously greater  what are the risks indoors in a restaurant  a fascinating insight comes from a study in the chinese city of guangzhou which tracked how a cluster of infections occurred  sitting at tables that were one metre apart people were having a meal last january  one of the diners was infected with coronavirus but hadnt realised because they had no symptoms  but in the following days another nine people whod been in the restaurant at the time came down with covid19  including five whod been sitting at other tables several metres away  scientists investigating the infections reached a conclusion about the most likely route of transmission that droplets containing the virus  released by the infected person  were circulated by air conditioning  the key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow their study says blaming two air conditioning units mounted high on a wall  this is not proof that the virus can be spread this way but the research certainly suggests that it is a plausible route  and if confirmed it would mean that in any room with a similar system of ventilation even moving tables more than one metre apart would still not guarantee to keep people safe  what do we know about the effect of ventilation  to try to understand the risks a team from the university of oregon specialising in the study of microbes in buildings simulated different types of ventilation in a restaurant  in one scenario someone at a corner table coughs without covering their mouth and releases droplets and particles that are projected through the air  the largest droplets land on their own table  thats what youd expect with the whos one metre rule  image copyright university of oregon image caption computer modelling by the university of oregon showing the potential spread of coronavirus in a restaurant with an air conditioning unit  but smaller ones reach beyond the immediate area and are caught in a current of air coming from an air conditioning unit at the other end of the room  the result is similar to whats thought to have happened in the restaurant in guangzhou tiny droplets and particles are spread to people at other tables  as with that study this simulation doesnt prove that the coronavirus can be transmitted this way or if it did that it would make anyone ill  that depends on whether the virus is still active after being blown across the room and on whether the person receiving it gets a large enough dose  but the possibility of infection cant be ruled out  according kevin van den wymelenberg professor of architecture at the university of oregon who led the study the virus can be spread further than people might realise  what can be done to make restaurants safer  the oregon team simulated another scenario in the same restaurant in which theres an open window beside the person who coughs and an extractor vent on the opposite wall  this time the cloud of droplets and particles is not pushed around the room but instead travels in a fairly direct line from window to vent with the result that fewer people are caught in it  a flow of fresh air to dilute the virus is one of several techniques highlighted by the team as options for managing covid19  image copyright university of oregon image caption the simulations showed how fresh air from an open window could carry the virus to a vent  its really impossible to completely eliminate risk says prof van den wymelenberg but what we showed was a concept for how you could reduce transmission  the good news is that there are things you can do to make safer spaces  in addition to bringing in fresh air through windows or mechanical ventilation other options include improving the standard of filtration and also humidifying the air  moist conditions might encourage droplets to sink to the floor  what does this mean on planes  social distancing isnt likely to be possible  unless the aircraft is half empty  and by definition youll be in close contact with others for more than 15 minutes  so on the basis of those two key factors the risks may well be higher the question of ventilation is more debatable  on the one hand the air in the cabin is constantly circulated so if someone coughs even a few rows away there is a chance the infection will be spread  on the other hand modern aircraft filter the cabin air every few minutes and to a high standard  what about the risks at work  in factories and offices social distancing may be harder to follow  dr julian tang of the university of leicester has come up an easy breath test to check if youre too close to colleagues  a consultant virologist at leicester royal infirmary hes studied how the air is moved when people speak and concludes that something as simple as a conversation could pass the virus  if you can smell your friends breath  the garlic or curry or alcohol  youre inhaling what theyre breathing out  and if youre inhaling enough of that air to smell it then youre close enough to inhale any virus thats also carried in the air with it  so how can transmission take place  so far the public advice has focused on whats called the droplet route someone coughing or sneezing into the eyes nose or mouth of a person nearby which has led to the social distancing rules  its also highlighted a second route  surfaces  in which a person whos infected passes on the virus through contact either directly by shaking hands or by exhaling over surfaces like kitchen worktops  image copyright hexagonmsc image caption modelling by hexagonmsc software showing how an infected person could pass the virus to a fellow passenger on a train  others then get the contamination on their hands directly or by using the same space at work or at home  which is why handwashing is so important  but theres a third possibility as well  tiny droplets or particles being carried in the air by speech for example and that route might be the most important according to dr tang  when youre talking to a colleague you dont touch them you dont spit on them most of the interaction is by voice and breathing  all of which reinforces the idea that there isnt one way to stay safe it involves social distancing and keeping any close contacts brief and checking for healthy ventilation  follow david on twitter

393,huawei what would happen if the uk ditched the chinese firm,image copyright getty images  huaweis future in the uk is in doubt  again  the consequences could affect how quickly improved internet access is rolled out and how much it will cost this a time when the countrys economy is already in a precarious state because of the coronavirus pandemic  the catalyst for a potential rethink is the uss move to restrict the firms ability to buy chips which was justified on national security grounds  on sunday the uks national security centre ncsc confirmed it was examining what impact this would have on the uk networks that use huaweis tech  that sounds quite vague but it potentially paves the way for a government uturn  in january the prime minister gave the green light to continued use of the firms tech in mobile and broadband networks but said its its market share must be reduced  now he might appreciate the chance for change of mind  it would help boris johnson prevent backbenchers who favour a ban from derailing his forthcoming telecoms infrastructure bill  moreover it offers him a way to defuse tensions with the white house which has said continued use of huawei will have a dramatic impact on our ability to share security information  mr johnson and president trump may meet next month at a mooted g7 summit blocking huawei could help secure a postbrexit trade deal even if it made relations with china trickier  image copyright pa media image caption boris johnson may meet donald trump at the us presidents camp david retreat at a proposed g7 summit  but the company warns there would be consequences  more suppliers means greater competition innovation and network reliability and crucially ensures consumers have access to the best possible technology victor zhang huaweis uk chief told the bbc  removing huawei would seriously delay 5g costing the british economy up to £7bn he added citing a study published last year by mobile uk a trade group that represents uk network operators  time consuming  part of the reason mobile providers are concerned is that the current version of 5g relies on new equipment being plugged into existing 4g kit from the same vendor  a lot of the 4g expansion was softwareupgradeable to do 5g when an extra mast antenna was fitted explained andrew ferguson editorinchief of the news site thinkbroadband  so he added even if a huawei ban was limited to the newer technology networks would still have to rip out and replace some of their older infrastructure as well  image copyright huawei image caption huawei has sold 5g equipment all over the world  its not only a very expensive process for the operators but its going to be a timeconsuming one as well because they need to get access to all those sites to make the changes added matthew howett from assembly the consultancy that wrote mobile uks report  and huawei has been very innovative at coming up with the smallest and lightest 5g equipment meaning the operators can sometimes just use a cherry picker to hook it onto existing mast infrastructure some of the others is heavier and bulkier which can require more in terms of getting planning consent and road closures  huaweis major 5g rivals are nokia and ericsson  two european firms  the networks claim that having three providers to choose from helps them negotiate lower prices  in many cases they want a mix of two suppliers so that if technical problems arise with one they can fall back on the other to provide a reduced service that doesnt always involve huawei  o2 for instance picked nokia and ericsson to be its primary 5g vendors despite having trialled the chinese firms kit  a study commissioned by huawei last year claimed locking it out would increase a countrys 5g investment costs by between 8 and 29 due to reduced competition  and if mobile providers have to spend more consumers can expect their bills to rise too  but one mp opposed to huaweis rollout says there are more important considerations  theres a free and fair competition element here theres a security element theres a dataprivacy element and theres a sort of geopolitics of chinese influence as well  the influence of the chinese communist party bob seely a member of the foreign affairs committee told the bbc  there shouldnt on principle be highrisk vendors in the communications network  huawei denies it uses state subsidies to undercut its rivals adding that it would never spy on chinas behalf or otherwise deliberately compromise its clients  home broadband  huawei is also a big player in fixedline broadband  it currently accounts for about 44 of the equipment used in providing superfast fullfibre connections directly to homes office and other buildings according to uk regulator ofcom  bts openreach division aims to bring that in line with a 35 government target by using more kit from nokia and the us firm adtran  but this sidesteps the fact that more properties rely on an alternative setup in which fibre only reaches roadside cabinets and the last leg is supplied by a copperbased connection the reason this is relevant is that tens of thousands of the cabinets involved are huaweis  image copyright getty images image caption many of the fibre broadband cabinets are filled with equipment sold by huawei  they connect directly to the core of the network commented mr ferguson  but replacing those is a complete nonstarter unless someones going to throw many billions of pounds at it and also all the people to do the work  while huaweis opponents would prefer it to be gone altogether they acknowledge this is impractical in the short term  but mr seely suggested that cabinets and other such products should be swapped out for alternatives when they are up for replacement  one thing practically everyone agrees on is that the matter needs to be settled once and for at a time when so much else about the economy is uncertain  these procurement decisions can take 18 months to two years to finalise and it takes time to ramp up supply to meet the demand said mr howett  so this isnt just a question of overnight deciding not to use huawei  it would take many years to do it properly

452,a political gale worlds press on dominic cummings selfdefence,world media have reacted with disbelief to dominic cummings’ defence of his trip to durham saying that what the “machiavellian” adviser saw as reasonable behaviour did not appear so to many and risked damaging not just boris johnson’s government but democracy  “no regrets no excuses no resignations … il ne regrette rien” said libération telling the story of “an extraordinary press conference during which dominic cummings confirmed that he had rewritten for himself the rules of the lockdown laid down by the government for which he works”  only once did the prime minister’s chief adviser appear confused the french paper said “almost taken aback by the question why no he had not ‘offered his resignation or even thought of offering it’ because he had absolutely no idea why he should have over and over again he repeated ‘i acted reasonably’”  of cummings’ easter jaunt to barnard castle undertaken – by his account – to check that his eyesight was up to the journey back to london libération remarked “to many driving 30 miles with blurred vision and a fouryearold in the back might not be considered entirely reasonable but not apparently to dominic cummings”  le monde was equally astonished “usually special advisers remain in the shadows” it said “at worst when things go wrong they quit they never speak in public  but for more than an hour cummings delivered his version of the facts assuring all that he had ‘acted reasonably’ without breaking the rules”  there was “no question of apologising at most he conceded one or two minor errors … but will the operation have been successful it will in any case have shown how deeply cummings wants to keep his job and how deeply boris johnson cares about this very special special adviser”  spain’s el país said cummings was meant to be “the breath of fresh irreverent air that was going to help boris johnson design a new country after brexit” but the adviser’s “refusal to express any remorse for breaking the lockdown rules has caused a political gale that may irreparably damage the prime minister’s political credibility”  johnson’s “machiavellian henchman is asking for a display of understanding and empathy that at another time and for another person might have seemed humane and reasonable” the paper said  “but cummings has left a trail of political enemies along the way and the patience of british public opinion is at breaking point the adviser so famously capable of scenting the mood of the people has not grasped that sometimes a resignation is not fair or unfair but necessary to protect a superior”  in germany die welt described a “bizarre” event at which “the second most powerful man in westminster after boris johnson … refused to step down or even apologise despite massive criticism of his trip to relatives during the coronavirus crisis cummings could have irreparably damaged confidence in the government”  the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said cummings had “gone down in history as the first adviser to give a live press conference in downing street” usually the paper said “political advisers work for the government in cummings’ case it is ministers who work for the adviser one after another has been sent out to defend him”  whether the adviser’s trip broke the rules “remains a matter of interpretation” the paper said but there was no denying the extent of “the outrage that has shaken the country in the past few days not just politicians and commentators but academics and churchmen – all echoing the chorus of citizens demanding cummings go”  in the netherlands nrc handelsblad said johnson was now stuck with “a growing problem firing cummings even temporarily would remove his right hand – and johnson’s most important ministers were appointed because of their views on brexit not their expert special knowledge or leadership experience”  but keeping him “is equally dangerous” the paper said “it will show the british public that they do not need to observe the lockdown rules so strictly and in that case the authority of the johnson government will crumble yet further”  cummings is the real boss worlds press pours scorn on boris johnson read more  beyond europe australia’s the age said cummings’ press conference had “compounded his difficulties in a manner reminiscent of prince andrew’s catastrophic bbc interview in november”  of the trip to barnard castle “to test whether his eyes were working properly” it asked “after setting himself up as examiner and examinee what were other drivers on the open road to do if he failed his own assessment”  in a crisis such as the coronavirus the paper said “those who wield power − especially when they do so largely behind the scenes − cannot be exempted from accountability for their actions in arguing as cummings has that his is an exceptional case he has given the impression he is beyond reproach that is not a healthy position for anyone in a democracy to occupy”
453,francogerman plan for european recovery will face compromises,macronmerkel plan to borrow on behalf of eu to help worsthit countries is already being challenged by ‘frugal four’  when france and germany announced a plan to raise €500bn £448bn on financial markets to fund a european coronavirus recovery plan leaders sought to underscore the magnitude of the moment  the french president emmanuel macron hailed “a real change of philosophy” with the plan for the european commission to borrow money on behalf of the entire eu and issue grants to the most stricken industries and regions angela merkel the german chancellor declared “the nation state has no future standing alone” and the german finance minister olaf scholz evoked the legacy of the us founding father alexander hamilton who helped to transform the us into a true political unit with his scheme for the national government to take on debts accrued by individual states  the head of the commission ursula von der leyen will on wednesday seek to turn what was billed as a revolution and longoverdue constitutional moment for the eu into a detailed plan that commands the support of 25 other member states her paper is expected to fall into two parts a revamped eu budget for 202127 that fills the €10bnayear brexit hole as well as a recovery plan to pull europe’s economies out of what is forecast to be the worst collapse since the 1930s great depression spending will be heavily tilted to the european green deal the precoronavirus plan to tackle the climate emergency as well as boosting digital technology and research  dalia grybauskaitė the president of lithuania between 2009 and 2019 said the merkelmacron plan was an “unavoidable step” for the eu given the scale of the economic shock “we are going closer to fiscal union and that means deeper european integration” she told the guardian  while alexander stubb a former prime minister of finland isn’t wholly convinced by comparisons with hamilton – “i have a feeling that some people are basing their view a little bit too much on the play and not on the reality” – he described the francogerman plan as “a very significant initiative” and “symbolically very important to portray solidarity”  the joint statement by merkel and macron came as a surprise in germany even to the chancellor’s party colleagues many of whom had eyed von der leyen’s initial proposal for a corona recovery fund with suspicion  but merkel has had three domestic factors playing in her favour her government’s handling of the pandemic has led to popularity ratings for her and her government rising to historic highs while the party most vocally opposed to any form of paneuropean burdensharing the farright afd has been riven by infighting  finally the chances of resistance to the francogerman proposal from within her own cdu party have been considerably reduced by delegates not being able to meet in person cdu meetings were held online during the lockdown minimising room for plotting in dark corners  not all merkel watchers believe that the recovery fund amounts to a policy uturn and within her party merkel’s allies have been quick to emphasise to fiscal conservatives that the recovery fund would retain a characteristically cdu signature with bonds that are timelimited and tied to specific projects  jana puglierin who heads the berlin offices of the european council on foreign relations said that if there was a moment that would have changed merkel’s mind about accepting more burdensharing it would have been 5 may when germany’s constitutional court in karlsruhe questioned the legality of the european central bank’s bondbuying programme  “the german government has form when it comes to tolerating policies it rhetorically opposes” said puglierin “the karlsruhe ruling made something impossible for germany that it had long tolerated … there was a sudden pressure to come up with an alternative”  facebook

taccagetty images  germany’s conversion to joint european debt means the eu’s four largest nations are now united on a core economic principle italy’s prime minister giuseppe conte however facing a steep 95 drop in output this year has complained that the amount falls short of what is needed to keep the european economy afloat spain’s prime minister pedro sánchez who has previously called for a €15tn recovery plan described it cautiously as “a positive step in the right direction”  luis garicano an economics professor who represents the spanish centrist ciudadanos party in the european parliament says ﻿he worries that the merkelmacron plan will become “hopelessly damaged” in the long hours of negotiations between eu leaders “that is the risk as it goes through all the negotiations that this clear recognisable plan becomes this messy christmas tree construction”  the shock of coronavirus could split europe – unless nations share the burden  moritz schularick and adam tooze read more  merkel and macron had barely left their respective podiums before a warning shot was fired by the eu’s selfstyled “frugal four” nations via austria’s chancellor sebastian kurz austria denmark the netherlands and sweden revealed their own plan at the weekend calling for a recovery fund based on loans “not leading to any mutualisation of debt”  meanwhile there are worries among beneficiaries of eu funds that money will be redirected south rather than east the czech prime minister andrej babiš told national media it would be “unfair to be penalised for being successful” referring to the low number of coronavirus cases in his country  these opening gambits raise the prospect of another euro stalemate yet grybauskaitė a veteran of eu crisis summits is confident there will be a compromise she said there had been an important change since february when leaders had failed to agree a sevenyear budget “germany agreed to pay a large amount of money to save the european economy that’s as simple as it is … how can you block it”  stubb who served as his country’s finance minister during many bailout meetings also expects a compromise that neither fully satisfies north south or east nor matches the original francogerman proposal for him it’s a classic european story following the arc of crisis chaos and ending in “suboptimal solutions” – another messy end for a union that is neither the utopia of its admirers nor the dystopia of critics  “this will be a good solution but of course it will be suboptimal because by definition that is what european decisions are”

deepens the crisis engulfing the government with more than 20 backbench mps calling on boris johnson to sack his chief aide and considerable anger among some ministers about cummings’ actions  another tory mp simon jupp went public on tuesday saying he felt “anger disappointment and frustration” at cummings’ actions and that the adviser should resign  the mp for east devon wrote on his facebook page “we are all making significant sacrifices and coping with situations we couldn’t imagine just a few months ago many of us including myself have lost people in our lives and haven’t been able to see family and friends it’s been incredibly tough for everyone …  “although i believe his cummings’ actions were motivated by a father’s desire to do what he felt was necessary to protect his family in exceptional circumstances if placed in the same situation i wouldn’t have made the same decisions and would have since considered my position”  and jupp’s tory colleague william wragg who chairs parliament’s public administration and constitutional affairs select committee tweeted “we cannot throw away valuable public and political good will any longer it’s humiliating and degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an adviser this is a time of national emergency and our focus must be unrelenting we owe it to the nation”  however johnson has rallied behind his senior aide – a key architect of brexit and the prime minister’s election victory – and marshalled top cabinet ministers including rishi sunak and matt hancock to do the same  michael gove a cabinet office minister insisted on tuesday that “fairminded people” would have to make up their own minds  the longtime ally of cummings was sent out to defend him in broadcast interviews the day after the aide gave a statement explaining why he drove 264 miles from london to durham during the lockdown and risked spreading coronavirus  play video 236 cummings i dont regret what i did reasonable people may disagree – video  police medics and scientists continued to say that cummings’ actions risked undermining the lockdown and public health advice  sir peter fahy the former chief constable of greater manchester police said officers were frustrated by the case which made it difficult to see the future role of the police in controlling lockdown  he told bbc radio 4’s today programme “there’s a lot of confusion and it feels like there’s quite a gap between the public narrative and narrative of ministers about the lockdown and what’s happening on the street  “i think it’s quite hard to see the role the police have in the future – the rules about the reasons for travel are now very confused when you see the crowds on bournemouth and southend beaches and other places yesterday it’s hard to see what role the police have in trying to control that”  niall dickson the chief executive of the nhs confederation which represents nhs organisations told the same programme “because of the way this story has unfolded there is certainly concern among our members health leaders that it could damage staff and public confidence in official guidance  “you can’t say too often that the guidance has actually saved thousands of lives and i think if we look forward over the next few weeks following guidance is going to be as vital as ever and actually it’s going to be more complex because as lockdown eases the advice is frankly less binary and people have to exercise more discretion”  key contradictions about cummings’ story remain with gove pressed to explain how the government can continue to claim that the adviser acted within the rules  in a round of broadcast interviews gove was asked  • why cummings went back to work in no 10 after suspecting that his wife could have contracted coronavirus risking spreading the virus further among colleagues gove said she was unwell but did not have official coronavirus symptoms of a cough or fever at that time  • why the aide decided that same night to drive 264 miles to durham to stay on his parents’ estate because of concerns that he and his wife had coronavirus despite government instructions to selfisolate at home gove said he had been acting out of concern that they would be unable to care for their child despite neither of them having classic coronavirus symptoms at that point  • whether it was acceptable for them to have risked spreading coronavirus from the hotspot of london to rural durham where there were few cases given their son later needed hospital treatment in the northeast gove said his actions had been appropriate  • why people should accept his explanation that he needed to make a 60mile round trip to a beauty spot with his family to test his eyesight before travelling back to london gove said it was safe for him to have driven and that cummings had been “preparing for work”  • why the aide needed to seek help with possible backup childcare in the northeast when longtime friends in london could have helped including gove himself gove said he would not have expected cummings to have turned to him instead of close family  play video 222 why not go to specsavers

461,tracing patient zero why americas first coronavirus death may for ever go unmarked,experts are investigating how the coronavirus spread through the us – but pinpointing its arrival is nearly impossible  the us is nearing the bleak milestone of 100000 confirmed coronavirus deaths but in all likelihood the nation’s coronavirus death toll actually hit the figure days before and despite scientists’ best efforts that date will forever go unmarked  coronavirus was probably spreading through the us before the trump administration restricted travel from china before the us had a reliable supply of diagnostic tests and before the disease caused by the virus was even named models of the covid19 outbreak estimate that the virus was making its way through america’s major cities undetected weeks before a california woman in early february became the first american known to have died of related causes  researchers are now doing detective work revisiting autopsies from early this year and studying how the virus has subtly evolved to try to trace when covid19 may have first sickened and killed people in the us infectious disease experts caution however that finding a “patient zero” or even figuring out exactly how many americans were infected and died before testing was available will be nearly impossible  the first ‘first case’  the first report of coronavirus in the us came on 21 january when a man in washington state who had traveled to wuhan china tested positive the seattle area soon became a hotspot with cases soaring after an outbreak at a nursing home outside the city on 29 february washington state reported what at the time was believed to be the nation’s first death from covid19  coronavirus cases were also identified in california in late january initially among those who had recently travelled to wuhan by late february california’s governor gavin newsom said officials were monitoring more than 8400 patients – but the state had only 200 testing kits  facebook twitter pinterest medical officials work at the california department of public health in late february photograph justin sullivangetty images  tests were difficult to come by across the nation after the centers for disease control and prevention cdc had botched the rollout of diagnostic kits and delayed allowing private and academic labs to develop their own initially only the most severely ill patients were being tested and those who had recently travelled were prioritized  it was only by looking back that california officials realized that the virus may have been spreading through the state and killing residents earlier than they had thought large hospitals and academic medical centers routinely preserve and store tissue samples from autopsies for six months to a year in april an analysis of samples from the autopsy of a 57yearold santa clara woman who died suddenly in her home on 6 february revealed that she succumbed to the disease the woman probably contracted the virus at least a week or two before she died the fact that she had not travelled outside the country means that coronavirus was spreading within the community by midtolate january  as we do more testing i think it would be quite likely that we will find cases that go back several months in north america andrew badley mayo clinic  recently washington officials have been looking into the cases of two patients with symptoms typical of covid19 in late december after they recently tested positive for antibodies to the virus these patients could have suffered from a severe flu or other respiratory illness and contracted the coronavirus later – but more research and widespread serological tests could help clear up whether some severe cases in late december or january that appeared to be cold or flu were in fact covid19  “absolutely there’s a chance that there were more infections that resulted in death at a time when we didn’t know about this novel coronavirus” said andrew badley chair of the mayo clinic’s covid19 research task force “as we do more testing i think it would be quite likely that we will find cases that go back several months in north america”  ‘we’re not going to exhume bodies’  but much about these early cases is – and will remain – unclear  newsom the california governor ordered coroners in the state to review autopsies back to december and the mayo clinic is one of many academic medical centers giving cases of pneumonia and flulike illness a second look but because only a fraction of deaths at a given medical center are autopsied and because of the small number of coronavirus infections even widespread reviews of preserved tissues would not fill in the full picture  “i mean we’re not going to exhume bodies and test them” said george rutherford an epidemiologist at the university of california san francisco  facebook twitter pinterest a man wears a protective mask while waiting for a train in san francisco in late february as california monitored travelers for signs of the virus photograph david paul morrisgetty images  at stanford university researchers who tested batches of samples collected before midfebruary found that only two of nearly 3000 people with respiratory disease symptoms were infected with coronavirus while researchers know that there were sporadic cases early on more research is needed to figure out how widely the virus was circulating in january and february according to stanford’s benjamin pinsky who led the testing effort  that the us saw a late severe flu season makes it even trickier to tease apart whether it was the flu or coronavirus that was making people sick in january and february said rutherford he wouldn’t be surprised if more early cases turned up but he said it was unclear why if the virus was circulating early patients were not overwhelming hospitals early on “the big mystery is why don’t we have even more cases now if it was spreading before we had shelter in place and all that” he said  elsewhere researchers are hoping to learn more by studying the virus’s genetic makeup “all viruses have the ability to mutate and change a little bit over time” said badley by tracing different strains of the virus and working out the rate at which the virus tends to change researchers can estimate when each strain was introduced to a region bradley explained but the process is tricky and requires that the older strains of the virus still be around – either preserved in tissue samples or spreading through the population  a genetic analysis found at least eight lineages of the coronavirus circulating in northern california suggesting that the virus was introduced to the region several times from different sources that research has yet to be peerreviewed and published in a scientific journal but these early findings support what many epidemiologists believe that there wasn’t a single “patient zero” who sparked the outbreak in the us  facebook twitter pinterest a solano county california resident who had an early us case of the coronavirus was held in isolation at the uc davis medical center in late february photograph justin sullivangetty images  definitely interesting but useful  “i see this fascination with finding who the patient zero was both in the us or even globally” pinsky said with a chuckle “but i’m not sure how much we’d gain by actually finding that out”  researchers are more interested in grappling with the present and future of the pandemic ramping up testing and preparing for a potential seasonal surge in the fall pinsky said “looking for the first case or death is an interesting but not so useful exercise”  i see this fascination with finding who patient zero was but im not sure wed gain by finding out benjamin pinsky stanford university  if previous epidemics are to be a guide there were multiple patient zeros said stephen morse an epidemiologist at the columbia university medical center focused on developing early disease warning systems “there was probably more than one introduction of the virus from wuhan to the us and then other introductions from europe” morse said “even if we eventually figure it out and are able to trace the route the virus took it’ll be information that’s more of intellectual interest than scientific interest”  a better understanding of the path the virus took early on in the us could help states better prepare for a potential second surge of cases in the fall and it could help smaller countries that have yet to be significantly impacted by the pandemic to protect themselves  the real lesson here experts said is that the us government should have paid attention to early warning signs when they initially cropped up “i’m heartbroken and disheartened” morse said “i’ve worked for the past 30 years trying to prevent the sort of catastrophe we’re seeing right now”  the us could have begun testing for coronavirus soon after it started to spread in wuhan especially given the amount of travel between the us and china morse noted countries could have better coordinated their responses and worked together to track and trace early cases  “of course my hope is that as we trace back this pandemic we’ll learn something” morse said “but this time we didn’t learn from past outbreaks and my suspicion is that by the time another one comes around years from now nobody remembers the lessons”
462,explainer what do we now know about covid19 – and can you get it twice,explainer what do we now know about covid19 – and can you get it twice  can you catch the coronavirus a second time  that remains unclear a key question is whether antibodies produced by the body following an infection with the coronavirus provide some level of immunity and if so for how long  but we do have some clues “we know from ‘normal’ coronavirus studies done in the past you can infect people after about a year following an initial infection” said dr ben killingley consultant in acute medicine and infectious diseases at university college london hospital  dr joshua schiffer an expert in infectious diseases at fred hutchinson cancer research center in the us added that any signs of reinfection would require detailed scrutiny  “i have yet to see a definitive case of reinfection reported in the scientific literature to date to truly prove reinfection and discriminate from prolonged viral shedding related to the first infection would require sequencing of both the first and second viruses and demonstration that the two viruses are genetically different” he said adding it will also be important to look at symptoms and how long reinfection lasts  “it is also important to recognise that documentation of one or a handful of reinfections does not prove that this is a common epidemiologically important event”  what happened in south korea where patients tested positive after having recovered from covid19  this initially caused concerns as experts feared the results might suggest patients had been reinfected however the world health organization has since said the results were actually false positives a result of the test picking up particles of the virus within dead lung cells – but this is not active virus that’s because the pcr or “haveyougotit” test is based on detecting genetic material from the virus – on its own it does not reveal whether that virus is active and infectious or not  why do some people have longlasting symptoms  some people with covid19 experience complications following an initial infection  “in some persons they begin to feel well again and signs and symptoms including fever decrease but some then go on to develop respiratory distress and must be provided oxygen in hospital” said david heymann professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine “it appears to be a delayed immune response that is more serious in some persons and that reacts to remaining virus in various organs”  even some people who have had a mild experience of covid19 have reported experiencing symptoms for several weeks or even months although experts say only time and testing will tell what the longterm implications are and how common this is  lingering and painful the long and unclear road to coronavirus recovery read more  killingley said it was unclear what was behind such ongoing symptoms but there are a range of possibilities – including inflammation caused by the virus – although the mechanisms and risks are as yet unclear  immunology professor daniel altmann of imperial college london said such cases are important to study  “we are at the beginning of describing what may be a complex picture of chronic disease that may ensue from the initial infection – coming and going in relapsing waves sometimes almost like a kind of chronic fatigue syndrome” he said “these cases may reflect examples of virus not fully cleared or alternatively some kind of damaging posthoc disturbance to immune or inflammatory function” he said  schiffer agreed such cases are cause for concern “in the case of sars cov2 my colleagues and i are particularly worried about the possibility of prolonged periods of lung inflammation andor scarring” he said  could the coronavirus lie dormant in the body and then reactivate  experts say it is unlikely “i know some have discussed ‘reactivation’ of virus but this seems unhelpful and unsupported to me” said altmann “it’s a term that’s borrowed from other viruses especially the herpes virus family that can hide in the body in a latent state to reactivate years later there is no evidence of that at all for coronaviruses”  how long are people with covid19 infectious for  a recent study of 60 coronavirus patients in china showed 10 patients tested positive for covid19 after discharge from hospital however once again experts say this could be down to the test picking up genetic material from inactive virus with other studies including work in south korea suggesting those who test positive with covid19 after recovering from the disease are not infectious  “it’s not uncommon to find virus in the nose or throat for up to four weeks after initial infection but tests to establish whether this is live infectious virus – as opposed to just genetic material detection – are not normally positive for much longer than a week” said killingley adding “i haven’t come across relapse cases whereby the initial infection acquired weeks ago reignites itself into an infectious case”  schiffer had doubts “in my view the presence of sars cov2 rna many weeks after initial infection may represent ongoing viral replication in cells which also implies the persistence of small amounts of “active” virus” he said “however quantities are tiny and may represent the dying embers of infection in the body”  altmann said that asymptomatic cases aside infectiousness correlates strongly with acute symptoms which typically last for up to 12 days with a tailout to 28 days “my sense is that in the people who are feeling unwell long after this it may not be virus but some kind of immune or inflammatory perturbation” he said
463,world health leaders urge green recovery from coronavirus crisis,doctors and medical professionals from around the globe have called on world leaders to ensure a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis that takes account of air pollution and climate breakdown  more than 200 organisations representing at least 40 million health workers – making up about half of the global medical workforce – have signed an open letter to the g20 leaders and their chief medical advisers pointing to the 7 million premature deaths to which air pollution contributes each year around the world  chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers must be directly involved in designing the stimulus packages now under way the letter urges in order to ensure they include considerations of public health and environmental concerns they say public health systems should be strengthened and they warn of how environmental degradation could help to unleash future diseases  the signatories also want reforms to fossil fuel subsidies with public support shifted towards renewable energy which they say would make for cleaner air cut greenhouse gas emissions and help to spur economic growth of nearly 100tn in the next three decades  in the letter the health professionals link air pollution and fragile public health systems with the impacts of the virus saying air pollution “was already weakening our bodies” exacerbating the impact of the disease  “we have witnessed firsthand how fragile communities can be when their health food security and freedom to work are interrupted by a common threat the layers of this ongoing tragedy are many and magnified by inequality and underinvestment in public health systems we have witnessed death disease and mental distress at levels not seen for decades” they write  better preparation could have reduced the impacts from the covid19 pandemic according to the letter “we must learn from these mistakes and come back stronger healthier and more resilient” they write  studies have suggested that air pollution may play a role in worsening covid19 symptoms or increasing mortality though scientists also say it is too early to draw hard conclusions about the full impacts the clearing skies that have accompanied lockdown in many countries are under threat however as industrial activity resumes without new safeguards  last week a comprehensive study found daily carbon dioxide emissions around the world had fallen by about 17 as a result of the lockdowns and that if normal activity resumed there would be only about a 4 fall for the full year compared with last year such a fall would make little difference in the climate crisis  some countries are considering a green recovery from the crisis by attaching stern conditions to any bailouts for fossil fueldependent industries such as aviation and by pumping money into infrastructure that reduces greenhouse gases from broadband for remote working to better cycle lanes and electric vehicle charging points a recent study from oxford university found this would yield more jobs and a better return on public investment than returning to business as usual  “health professionals are at the frontlines of this emergency and we are seeing the immense loss of lives because of acting too late” said miguel jorge the president of the world medical association “we know now more than ever that healthy lives depend on a healthy planet as we walk on the road to recovery we need to build a system that will protect us from further damage we need a healthy and green recovery”  health professionals are concerned that the world will resume its unhealthy practices as the immediate impacts of the coronavirus fade without learning the lessons needed to put us on a healthier path that would reduce the likelihood of such devastating pandemics in future as well as reducing illness from other causes and staving off climate breakdown  “covid19 has forced the world to pause and take stock providing us with a unique opportunity to make changes that will benefit the planet and all the people on it” said annette kennedy president of the international council of nurses “climate change poses an imminent and serious threat to the health of the world’s population we are calling on governments to make sure that pollution levels do not return to previous levels so that our children and grandchildren will be able to grow up healthily in a liveable and sustainable climate only by investing in both healthcare and the environment can we create a sustainable future”

464,irish taoiseach leo varadkar denies picnic with friends was covid19 rule breach,spokesperson says pm broke no laws or regulations during meeting with friends in a dublin park despite guidance against picnics  leo varadkar ireland’s taoiseach has defended having a picnic with friends in a dublin park in defiance of a recommendation from a senior government official  a spokesperson for varadkar issued a statement on monday night saying he “broke no laws breached no regulations and observed public health guidance” while picnicking in the phoenix park on sunday  the comment came after images appeared on social media showing the taoiseach with his partner matthew barrett and two friends near the park’s wellington monument varadkar was in shorts and shirtless  the outing appeared to contradict advice given in a media briefing last week by liz canavan assistant secretary of the department of the taoiseach she said “if you’re visiting a public amenity try not to stay too long at the site or have picnics please do your exercise and then go home”  johnson reckless in easing lockdown before varadkar expert says read more  some commentators accused the taoiseach of being cavalier with lockdown rules and setting a bad example similar to dominic cummings  the statement from varadkar’s office on monday night said phase one of ireland’s lifting of lockdown restrictions allowed a group of four people to meet outdoors as long as they were within five kilometres three miles of home and maintaining physical distance  “government guidelines allow people to spend time in the outdoors within 5km of their home while continuing to observe social distancing and good hygiene there are no specific government guidelines on eating outdoors or picnics”  during the coronavirus pandemic varadkar has lived at the stateowned farmleigh estate which is on the other side of the phoenix park and within five kilometres of the wellington monument  the chief medical officer tony holohan said the images of the picnic appeared to show respect for the rules “i didn’t see any pictures that are in violation of that involving the taoiseach”  holohan was speaking at a media briefing on monday that showed no reported deaths from covid19 for the first time since 21 march the total reported death toll is 1606 there were 59 new cases bringing the total of confirmed cases to 24698  “the number of new cases and reported deaths over the past week indicates that we have suppressed covid19 as a country” said holohan  varadkar called it a day of hope
465,experts sound alarm over lack of covid19 test kits in africa,public health experts have warned about the risks of low supplies of coronavirus test kits as lockdowns in african countries begin to ease and urban populations become more mobile  different countries on the continent have adopted a range of testing strategies but international competition for test kits and a lack of global coordination of resources have meant many african countries are testing with significantly limited reach  more than half of african countries are experiencing community transmission as lockdown measures relax  kate dooley the director for west africa at the tony blair institute said “most governments are currently rationing their use of test kits given limited supplies we are aware of some cases where african governments who placed orders in early march are still yet to receive the supply six to eight weeks later”  testing capacity logistics and staffing challenges posed structural constraints to the ability of many countries to increase testing even when supplies became available she said some countries such as nigeria had been waiting months for deliveries of test kits  there are 112000 confirmed cases of covid19 in africa and 3000 people are confirmed to have died from the virus  total infections are lower than in most other continents owing in part to the effectiveness of lockdown and control measures adopted early by several countries when cases were in their low dozens  according to the world health organization 15m covid19 tests have been conducted in africaover the last 6 weeks south africa and ghana account for half of the tests and just eight african countries have administered more than 3000 tests per million people  the africa centre for disease control and prevention has set up a digital purchasing platform being piloted this week to let african governments bulk order test supplies and protective equipment it is hoped the platform will improve the continent’s negotiating position when bidding for supplies  the acdc director dr john nkengasong said last month that “a collapse of global cooperation and a failure of international solidarity have shoved africa out of the diagnostics market”  “african countries have funds to pay for reagents but cannot buy them” he added  according to dr iruka okeke the editor of the african journal of laboratory medicine gains made by african countries in the early stages of the outbreak could be at risk from a lack of test supplies  “unless we can vastly ramp up testing we risk entering a stage where it spreads through communities where there isn’t the capability to test them” she said  the prevalence of virus response measures and detection systems in countries that have already experienced deadly viruses has been vital according to okeke  “responses to ebola hiv and lassa fever have improved the level of molecular biology in africa which countries have leveraged well  “the problem is countries were preparing for an epidemic not a pandemic so now african countries are competing for the same consumable resources as the other countries”  parts of ghana’s virus response have emerged as a model in the region with a population of 29 million the country has tested almost 200000 people one of the highest rates in africa the country has registered 6800 infections with over 2000 recoveries while 32 people have died  ghana has just five laboratories that can test for covid19 but has innovated to improve test levels running laboratories for 24 hours using drones to deliver samples from rural areas and testing multiple samples at the same time  improving the level of testing in africa’s most populous country has been difficult nigeria has 7800 confirmed infections with a third recovered and 226 deaths  but according to dr casmir ifeanyi the president of the association of medical and laboratory scientists of nigeria a medical union confirmed cases were “an underestimation of covid19 mobility  “we have conducted fewer than 40000 tests for a country of 200 million where we have community transmission across the country that is not the sample size to make any deduction about the spread of the virus” mass deaths in kano have put pressure on authorities to increase testing  there are now 25 laboratories that can test for covid19 up from five before the first confirmed case in february but despite a capacity for 2500 tests a day nigeria often administers less than half hampered by personnel and logistical constraints particularly in rural and insecure areas  “we’re in a very severe situation especially now the government is talking about further easing the lockdown” ifeanyi said “without testing this will create problems”

467,the guardian view on europe and covid19 time for true solidarity  editorial,in 1790 following the american war of independence alexander hamilton proposed that federal government should take on the huge debts incurred during the struggle by individual states it had long been hamilton’s view that this move would be a key moment in the forging of a true united states of america “a national debt” he had written “if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing it will be a powerful cement of our union”  until now this kind of thinking has never gained a foothold in the european union despite periodic calls for deeper fiscal union richer eu states have balked at the notion of pooling debt with weaker neighbours after the crash of 2008 when greece hovered on the edge of bankruptcy and a sovereign debt crisis threatened to engulf italy the eu went no further than the provision of emergency loans and cheap credit the bailout money came with painful strings attached as countries were obliged to launch deeply resented austerity programmes in order to manage their growing debt mountain the alternative – writing off debts in hamiltonian fashion – was dismissed out of hand by germany’s finance minister at the time wolfgang schäuble  that was then on wednesday angela merkel and emmanuel macron are expected to present plans for a €500bn £448bn eu recovery fund which would distribute nonrefundable grants to the countries that have suffered most during the coronavirus pandemic crucially the money would be borrowed by the european commission on behalf of all member states and sit within the eu budget to be agreed for 202127 germany would be liable for about €135bn £120bn    this could be a watershed moment since the adoption of the euro there has been fierce argument over whether a common currency should entail at least some degree of common debt the countries of the prosperous north led by germany have resisted such talk governments have been wary of seeing their borrowing costs rise and conscious that such a move would be domestically unpopular but covid19 is challenging old taboos  deprived of tourism revenue and facing the sharpest economic downturn in modern times southern europe fears a regional meltdown loan packages already agreed via the european stability mechanism while welcome will contribute to unprecedented levels of sovereign debt in these dire circumstances both mr macron and ms merkel have recognised that unless the burden of reconstruction is seen to be genuinely shared there will be existential implications for the future of the eu  last week ms merkel said the devastation wrought by the pandemic was of a magnitude such that it could “endanger the european union’s cohesion” mr macron has suggested the “european idea” itself will be in danger unless there is a stepchange in solidarity between the stronger and weaker eurozone states they are both right  the negotiations that begin on wednesday will not be easy at the weekend the first signs of organised opposition to the francogerman proposals emerged led by the socalled “frugal four” of the netherlands denmark sweden and austria eastern european countries which have had far lower infection and death rates during the pandemic have also balked at the idea of a jointly financed recovery fund it is vital that the substance of the merkelmacron plan survives intact hamilton was right in thinking that debt assumption by washington would consolidate the status of the emerging united states the eu needs to act in the same spirit in these similarly dramatic times
468,the guardian view on dominic cummings time to go  editorial,the prime minister’s chief adviser broke the lockdown and shows no regret in doing so he should not stay on advising a government that needs the public to abide by the rules  the prime minister’s chief adviser should be leaving downing street for good not be giving press conferences from its rose garden unlike millions of britons who stayed at home for the sake of collective safety of the country dominic cummings broke the lockdown in march while the rest of the uk was inconvenienced suffered hardship and lost loved ones without saying goodbye mr cummings drove 260 miles to his parents’ farm in durham after his wife fell sick  he had been forced to explain his actions after the guardian and mirror revealed his excursion last week yet mr cummings on monday blamed the media for spreading inaccurate stories while confirming the essence and detail of the reporting his defence was laughable he admitted driving 30 miles with his family to a beauty spot to “test his eyesight” this farrago of nonsense was made worse because mr cummings did not evince any substantial measure of regret he sought to defend his actions saying what he did was not a mistake but rather that they could be considered reasonable acts of a concerned father and husband  mr cummings and his wife had not been tested for coronavirus neither of them appear to have been seriously incapacitated at the same time they had one small child who needed looking after these were unfortunate circumstances not exceptional ones many many people dealt with far worse what mr cummings cannot seem to fathom is that if everyone considers their circumstances to be unusual and decides that they can move around the country in search of childcare then the virus will spread across households and across communities and the pandemic will grow and many lives will be lost as a result  the message in this health emergency to the public was clear “stay at home” for mr cummings the message appeared to be to “read the small print” and find a reasonable excuse not to the lack of selfawareness is galling the exemption that mr cummings rests his argument on was developed for people at risk of domestic abuse legal experts suggest that mr cummings’ defence would not stand up in a court of law let alone that of public opinion it is a stretch to think that the lockdown would allow people with what appeared to be coronavirus symptoms to leave their home and drive to another part of the country or to allow them to end up in a hospital hundreds of miles away from their house  mr cummings’ actions have the government in crisis but the country is in the grip of a coronavirus pandemic what has been asked of people is to make sacrifices for the collective wellbeing this requires a high level of cooperation and trust most people understood that they had to stay inside during the lockdown and believed that others would do the same they might not have done so if people like mr cummings had been given official backing to cheat these reciprocal arrangements  there is a long way to go in the coming weeks the british public is likely be asked to endure more restrictions for the greater good it is hoped that they will ignore mr cummings’ example and not bend or stretch the rules but carry on obeying them both in letter and in spirit because this is about protecting the lives of one’s family and one’s community the virus is being spread by people who think like mr cummings that the rules do not apply to them this is why he ought not to remain at the heart of the government
469,cummings’ contempt for lockdown rules makes the public feel like fools  fintan o’toole,it is not news that boris johnson and dominic cummings treat rules with contempt but there is one rule even they might be expected to obey because it is crucial to the maintenance of power never ever make the people who place their faith in you feel like fools  or to put it another way never let the people who think they are making a sacrifice realise that in fact they are the sacrifice before breaking this rule so flagrantly johnson and his consigliere would have done well to consider the fate of what used to be one of the most powerful institutions on these islands the irish catholic church  watching the cummings road movie made me think disturbingly enough of my mother she was for almost all of her life a devout catholic – and it’s the “almost” that is most interesting she was a kind and compassionate woman and she did not judge other people but she followed the rules there was one rule in particular she found awfully hard the church’s ban on contraception but she believed in the authority of the church she made the sacrifices and did what she was told  i will never forget her rage and disgust when in her late 70s and early 80s she discovered that the same church she loved and obeyed had been covering up the sexual abuse of children for decades she was revolted by those crimes of course but she also felt that the bishops had made a mockery of her faith they made her feel gullible her belief that she and the people she looked up to were together in this thing that they had shared a tough commitment and the pain it involved had turned out to be a charade  she was not alone and there was no going back from this moment of betrayal the authority of the church melted away in the heat of this anger for while people forgive their leaders a great deal – often far too much – there is no forgiveness for that terrible moment when you realise that the anguish you have endured for the greater good was to those in authority just a mark of your credulousness and inferiority  if cummings were half as smart as he is supposed to be he would have shown in his press conference some glimmer of understanding that this kind of betrayal is of a completely different order to the one he and johnson engage in so routinely the ordinary treachery of saying one thing and doing another – there will be £350m extra every week for the nhs there will never be a border in the irish sea – is mother’s milk to them perhaps because it is so habitual or because they are so used to getting away with it their sense of how it works has become dulled they missed the crucial fact that this time it’s different this time it’s personal  the mundane duplicity that is cummings’ and johnson’s stock in trade comes with a knowing smirk you didn’t really think we meant that literally did you it is part of an elaborate highly performative game but the rules for collective survival in a pandemic are not ironic they are intimate they are embodied they are the detailed texture of the lives we live every day like the rule that said catholics must not use contraceptives they inhabit people’s most private selves you mock those selves at your peril  if we were all coolly rational creatures the reasons why cummings should not be anywhere near the levers of power in a selfrespecting democracy would already have been abundantly clear his contempt for law and order was obvious from vote leave’s flouting of funding rules in the 2016 brexit referendum his scorn for the very idea that he might be held to ordinary standards of public accountability was amply demonstrated by his literal contempt for a parliamentary committee looking into that abuse but he got away with that stuff  so why does his odyssey during lockdown produce a whole different kind of emotion because it reaches into the innermost experiences of millions of people it cuts right through to the pain of a loved one dying alone of grandchildren growing distant of precious human bonds being forcibly severed it grabs hold of that torment and it squeezes the meaning out of it  we endure these things individually because we understand ourselves to be also enduring them collectively cummings’ actions – and even more johnson’s valorisation of them – strip away the second part the big communal and institutional structure that gives a value to the millions of individual sacrifices has been kicked away – in johnson’s defence of cummings the only value is the individual “instinct” of the members of the ruling caste to use the blitz analogy that england apparently cannot escape it’s fine to leave your lights on during the blackout if you’re an important person with documents to read  as the catholic church found in ireland people don’t forgive this violation of the sense of meaning that gives dignity to their own sufferings they don’t forgive because they can’t forget this kind of betrayal is not just an event out there in the public world of media and politics and power it is an experience that happens to every citizen individually and privately it is not possible for people to think about it without thinking of love and loss of the grief they have felt and the intimacies they have foregone to do so is to hear as the soundtrack to the images stored from these months in the mind and the heart an unpardonable snigger of elite condescension  • fintan o’toole is a columnist with the irish times    
470,the cummings debacle has exposed boris johnsons weakness and dependency  polly toynbee,out of the dark side emerged the power behind the throne can the supreme disrupter do humility can he grovel an apology in front of those he most despises  no regrets not sorry but he tried a kind of plea for pity the cummings family plainly had a bad time but his words may fall on stony hearts among other families who had also the virus but obeyed the stayathome order without travelling 260 miles the vast majority didn’t seek out loopholes but kept the “stay at home” rule in word and spirit did the cummings have no friend in london who would take a 30mile drive to a beauty spot risking wife and child as an eye test  everyone wants to interpret the orders their own way but as someone who sits on the science advisory group sage and as no 10 director of strategy he makes the rules never were these so crystal clear as when lockdown slammed the shutters  behind front doors people suffered in solitary confinement the single mother with the disabled child the cancer patient barred from their children aged grandparents in care homes who never saw families again most heartrending was the 13yearold boy dying all alone because his parents obeyed the rules to stay away  everywhere lonely deaths and lonely funerals are seared deep in everyone’s thoughts alongside tales of heroic health and care staff sacrificing their lives and local groups helping others everyone is touched by this national calamity which will yet leave more pain in its economic wake with so many jobless with careers blighted hopes dashed  just as well this thursday will be last the clapforcarers as the public mood risks turning angry clap the heroes but beat your saucepans at scoundrels who tell us to do what they say not what they do the prime minister’s defence of dominic cummings’ ruleflouting is no westminster bubble brouhaha but it drives right to the heart of voters’ lived experience typhoid dom and mary escaped london at peak infection within talking distance of parents while others pined for family  by clinging on both cummings and his leader expose an alienation from public sentiment after nine weary weeks of isolation with so much grief and ruin but they have opted to take on a flock of bishops police medics scientists and a flotilla of tory mps whose inboxes overflow with public indignation any minister would have been rapidly expelled this is no mere storm in a westminster bubble illegally shutting down parliament and lying to the queen did boris johnson no harm in the election because few voters felt personally prorogued but this is personal  for as long as cummings stays johnson is damaged burning through political credit when he has very little to spare sliding in polls that show 52 of voters calling for cummings to go only 28 to stay we know johnson to be a man without loyalty – not to friend lover or family faithful only to himself so why is cummings indispensable  this exposes the weakness and dependency of a prime minister who is only an empty frontman entirely unfit and unwilling to shoulder the job’s heavy lifting relying dangerously on a svengali who has persuaded him of his genius but as long as johnson cleaves to him he looks the servant not the master  look what else looms as a flurry of devastating analyses of johnson’s mishandling of the epidemic emerges even from his tory press as infections doubled every three days there were “38 days when britain sleepwalked into disaster” the sunday times found excoriating a lockdown delay that “cost thousands of lives” blithely johnson ordered “business a usual” boasting in true trumpian style on 2 march that britain was “very very well prepared” with “fantastic testing systems” and “amazing surveillance of the spread of the disease” radio 4’s more or less has just demolished the daily lies on testing it has never been anywhere near 100000 people a day – in fact barely half that once duplicate tests and nontests are deducted  cummings doesn’t matter what really matters is the damage done to trust in future official coronavirus messages this week johnson will relax the rules further partly bowing to pressure from the impatient right wing of his party persuading people to stick to more complicated rules will be hard while gradually easing out of lockdown  i talked to an experienced contact tracer now working on the covid19 trackandtrace scheme she describes the chaos of its overcentralised nonfunctioning computerised system which will certainly not be up and running by next monday let alone fulfil johnson’s fatuous promise of a “worldbeating” system  but here’s what worries her most she will be coldcalling people with no symptoms to order them to strictly homeisolate for 14 days just as everyone else is easing up if cummings couldn’t obey this even with florid infection in his family how much harder will it be to convince others not infected  explain apologise move on what johnson should have said about dominic cummings  simon jenkins read more  “we know there are mountain ranges of surges ahead of us each time there’s an easing of rules we expect rises at the end of june and the end of july and just hope there’s no second wave in the autumn or winter” she says freedom from lockdown means chasing down every new covid19 case commanding rigid obedience from all they’ve contacted even those who can barely remember meeting the infected person by defending cummings johnson has demolished a sense of moral obligation undermining the public spirit that says “i will if you will” he has allowed us all to follow our “instinct” not the contact tracers’ instructions  in a cry of despair prof stephen reicher of the sage behavioural insights subcommittee says “boris johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control covid19”  a government with a majority of 80 is rock solid but a tory prime minister is never safe leaders in this ruthless party last only so long as they remain winners after the outrage over her poll tax even margaret thatcher fell under their undying lust for power it’s an impulse that keeps conservatives in office most of the time – and one which labour often lacks  the tens of thousands of lives needlessly lost during johnson’s cavalier handling of the epidemic will weigh heavily on his premiership from now on indulging one of his own to disobey rules that everyone else followed may linger long in public memories too they will hope this blows away but i suspect it will leave behind political scars – yet another signal that we are never “all in this together”  • polly toynbee is a guardian columnist
471,dominic cummings has shown its one rule for the establishment another for everyone else,i  f the british establishment has one signature ethos it is “one rule for us and another for everybody else” it is this that caused national rage during the politicians’ expenses scandal when millions saw mps making absurd and frivolous claims – for duck islands second homes swimming pool boilers – at the taxpayers’ expense knowing that they on far smaller salaries would be sacked for gross misconduct for far less opulent claims at work it is this too which fuels anger over tax avoidance when the welltodo defy the spirit rather than the letter of the law in ways that are impermissible except for the gilded few  dominic cummings has applied this same establishment mantra but in the midst of a national emergency which has killed tens of thousands and restricted the movements of millions more many have had to endure sacrifices greater than they have ever faced  he needed to drive 30 minutes to a beauty spot to test his eyesight which he coincidentally did on his wife’s birthday  here is just one sacrifice a woman from the northeast of england tells me of how she decided to stay locked down in london missing the last two weeks of her father’s life when she attended her beloved dad’s funeral just miles from where cummings was staying – limited numbers two metres’ social distancing no physical comforting – the family were told that police would be on standby at the crematorium “and would act if we breached the guidelines” as she puts it “let’s not forget most ‘normal’ people do not get a press conference they get a fine”  cummings made his mark as the man who invented the now infamous “get brexit done” and reportedly applied this same comms ingenuity to the government’s initial clear and striking instruction “stay home” tonight his media strategy struck a different path first blame the media for misleading the public he repeatedly claimed that it was understandable for the public to be angry if they had relied on media reports but these were outright wrong here was brazen crybullying from a man whose chief political enterprises – vote leave and the conservative election campaign – relied on the zealous support of the rightwing press which had no qualms in monstering his opponents second bog down his critics in convoluted details to muddy the water and hope boredom sets in as each claim is dissected and contested  the claims themselves are indeed contradictory and full of bizarre logical leaps cummings said his wife was ill and showing signs of covid19 and his decision to seek childcare was motivated by the fact he might catch it so it’s not clear how driving across the country with a potentially infectious person fits with the rules  the fact his child was hospitalised in durham during their stay underlines why the rules are there in the first place their son tested negative but they did not know this when he was admitted at the time infections were much lower there than in london if potentially infected people from the hotspot of the pandemic travel across the country they risk seeding the virus in hospitals and allowing a deadly illness to spread to vulnerable patients  the rest of cummings’ contortions were a straightforward insult to sense reason and public intelligence he needed to drive about 30 minutes to a beauty spot to test his eyesight to make sure it was safe to drive back to london – which he coincidentally did on his wife’s birthday with both her and their little child in the car  the explanation why his wife wrote an article for the spectator detailing their life in lockdown to which he said he contributed “just a few lines” while failing to mention details of their sojourn makes little sense he claimed that revealing his whereabouts would risk his parents’ safety as his islington home in london was already being targeted due to media misinformation about his role in implementing lockdown if he believed he had been placed at risk because of his public profile and because personal details are in the public domain then why write such an article at all and why if all of this was above board the refusal to answer questions posed by journalists about his whereabouts for weeks  this isn’t about breaking the law and – except in some strikingly egregious examples – neither was the expenses scandal it is that when millions of people are making unprecedented sacrifices when many of their lives are already stressful and difficult as it is they expect those rules to be followed by everybody after all they are enduring this pain for the common good  and above all else they expect those in power who are responsible for implementing and enforcing the necessarily punitive rules to abide by them too a parent being stricken with coronavirus with a child to care for is not exceptional in a pandemic – indeed there are lone carers in that situation who have it far tougher many of those have stuck by the rules and undoubtedly struggled to care for their family as they did so but they did it all we have learned from cummings’ performance is he broke the rules and believes that his exceptional circumstances – particularly his important role in government – excuse this one rule for him one rule for everyone else  cummings’ defenders make ludicrous and selfdiscrediting claims that this is akin to a witchhunt any attempt to preserve one of the most influential figures in the country from scrutiny by bestowing victimhood on him must be resisted cummings broke his own rules everything else is noise and a public health strategy that exists to preserve human life has been undermined  the reasons for the government’s current panic are obvious boris johnson does not believe he can survive without cummings not least as the collective sense of loyalty in a crisis wears off and scrutiny intensifies over how a delayed lockdown and a failure of testing and lack of personal protective equipment led to europe’s worst death toll but a government that stirred the pot of a populist culture war claiming to be on the side of the little guy against an outoftouch contemptuous islington elite now has to face facts this elite now has a face and it is that of dominic cummings  • owen jones is a guardian columnist

to space”  according to the planetary society nasa has invested 62bn in ccp since 2010 making it the lowestcost human spaceflight development effort in almost 60 years the money has been mostly split two ways to spacex and its rival boeing whose uncrewed test flight of the starliner humanrated capsule ended in partial failure in december pushing back its next launch attempts to 2021  spacex which has been ferrying cargo to the iss since 2012 under a separate freight contract with nasa has had to overcome challenges of its own a crew dragon capsule was destroyed in a ground test explosion at cape canaveral in april 2019 and in 2015 a falcon rocket carrying supplies to the iss exploded 139 seconds into flight  “spaceflight is not easy they’ve had hiccups along the way and they’ve overcome them” said dr henry hertzfeld director of the space policy institute at george washington university’s elliott school of international affairs  “they’ve done quite well they’ve been in existence 20 years so not quite your startup at this point they have a younger more energetic workforce along with hiring some very good experienced people most having cut their teeth on government programs be it nasa or defense programs  “but the test is yet to come one hopes it is significant in the sense that the government put its money elsewhere to me it hasn’t been the capability of getting to space that we’ve been lacking it’s the extra money that human spaceflight requires even before the shuttle was retired there were other programs that we never completed that were government programs with human spaceflight in mind”  the cancellation of the workhorse shuttle program in 2011 after 30 years of flight and punctuated by two disasters that cost 14 astronauts their lives and lost the orbiters challenger and columbia marked dark days for the space industry more than 10000 jobs were lost and the economy around the florida space center tanked despite nasa’s continuing robotic exploratory

the foundation of the space force as the sixth branch of the us military and an ambitious order to nasa to make the first crewed moon landing since 1972 within the next four years will attend

set up a website launch america to enhance the experience  “this is a moment when we can all look and be inspired” bridenstine said “we have a moment in time when we don’t just have to reflect on how difficult things are right now we can talk about how bright things are going to be in the future”

475,brexit talks risk stalemate if no progress on key issues,eu sources say union needs to see movement from britain in terms of fair competition  brexit talks risk reaching a stalemate if there is no progress in the next round of negotiations between the european union and the british government eu sources have said  the two sides are due to resume talks next week the final round scheduled before a “highlevel conference” in june to assess progress before the endofyear deadline  after the chief negotiators michel barnier and david frost exchanged testy letters last week a senior eu official said there was a risk of stalemate if the eu did not see progress on its vital interests including how to ensure fair competition or a level play field between british and eu companies under a freetrade deal  “that is a crucial round” the official said “if there is no parallel progress – level playing field protection of fundamental rights and governance – then we risk going into july with a major problem the stalemate barnier warned about”  earlier this month the eu’s chief negotiator said “parallelism is a condition for progress” meaning that talks had to advance in all areas including priorities for the eu such as the level playing field and an agreement on fishing rights  frost argues the uk has set out a “comprehensive set of proposals” to prevent unfair competitive advantages but multiple eu sources say the british ideas are inadequate  in a setback for frost eu diplomats have rejected calls for the union to change its approach to the negotiations  one of several diplomats who spoke to the guardian and were opposed to the idea of rewriting the negotiating mandate said “a large majority of member states maybe all of us think that we have to stick to the mandate at this point of time and i don’t see a lot of movement … there are not many lights in the tunnel”  in a further blow to the uk diplomats also backed barnier’s accusation that the british were trying to “cherrypick” benefits from the eu single market that were not available to other countries with a freetrade agreement such as canada and japan  “the demands of the uk government at the moment are very unilateral” said a second eu diplomat “they want to keep the things that are suiting them but give away things in our interest”  the diplomat referred to british interest in an agreement on professional services such as law and auditing that goes beyond what the eu has done with other trade partners “to have british lawyers providing services around the eu i am not sure that is of interest to our lawyers especially when you the uk don’t want to be in the common ecosystem of common controls and rules”  eu diplomats are tired of the repeated reminders from frost’s team about the importance of uk sovereignty pointing out that their governments are also sovereign “the eu accepts that the uk is sovereign but that is not the issue” said the eu official “the issue is what you as a country are going to commit to to get access to our market that is the real question”  a uk government spokesperson said it was to be “expected at this stage in a very difficult negotiation that both sides are making their case robustly and ensuring it is understood we will continue to approach negotiations constructively but our position hasn’t changed – we won’t agree to any eu demands for us to give up our rights as an independent state  “and we’ve never asked for anything special bespoke or unique – we’re looking for a freetrade agreement based on precedent and similar to those the eu has already got with other countries like canada”  adding to pressure on barnier not to concede on fishing rights on monday night the european parliament’s fisheries committee threatened to veto any deal with the uk that did not include a “balanced” agreement on fish quotas allowing eu fleets continue access to british waters  “no fisheries agreement means no postbrexit agreement” said françoisxavier bellamy the french centreright mep – and member of barnier’s les républicains party – who drew up a report that was adopted with near unanimity by the committee
476,greece fears border standoff with turkey over migrants return,greece fears a fresh standoff on its border with turkey after the turkish foreign minister suggested migrants and refugees would shortly return to the frontier as the two countries emerge from coronavirus lockdowns  speaking to a local television station in antalya mevlüt çavuşoğlu said “due to the pandemic the movement of migrants has slowed down but they will definitely want to leave after the outbreak is over”  the statement set off alarm bells in athens where analysts are increasingly voicing fears of an iteration of the crisis that erupted earlier this year when the turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan declared the doors to europe were open and migrants free to cross into greece  after a hiatus of almost three months greek authorities reported several boats of men women and children landing on the shores of lesbos last week  some 37000 asylum seekers remain on the outposts in vastly overcrowded conditions that have been deplored by human rights groups  as a precautionary measure against coronavirus turkey sealed its northwestern land frontier demarcated by the evros river in midmarch but only after weeks of chaos and high drama in which thousands attempted to cross the border amid a hail of rubber bullets and teargas fired by elite forces on either side  in recent days there has been renewed tension over moves by athens to extend a 125kmlong razor wire fence along the frontier in land disputed by ankara  “as the region gradually emerges from coronavirus lockdown we are seeing a rise in tensions on all fronts” said angelos syrigos professor of international law at panteion university and an mp in the governing new democracy party “it is clear turkey wants to continue weaponising migrants and refugees to extract european support for its geopolitical goals my worry is that very soon we could see a new border crisis”  athens’ centre right government rallying eu support earlier this year deployed riot police and military patrols to the land border while dispatching gunships and coastguard vessels to conduct aroundtheclock patrols off the turkish coast  but frontex the eu border agency that is participating in the patrols has reportedly also predicted that the easing of coronavirus restrictions in turkey will likely result in thousands of migrants and refugees attempting once again to cross into greece internal documents seen by the german newspaper die welt suggested a mass movement of people towards the greekturkish border and shores opposite outlying aegean islands once internal containment measures are lifted the document dated 5 may indicated that 262 officers had been seconded to bolster the evros border region  in march the turkish interior minister süleyman soylu also warned that europebound migrants would be able to return to the greekturkish land border once the pandemic receded “when this epidemic is over we would not prevent whoever wants to leave” he said after ordering the evacuation of men women and children from the region  as home to more than 4 million refugees – more than anywhere else in the world – turkey has repeatedly threatened to open the gates to europe arguing that brussels has failed to provide adequate funding to host such numbers the vast majority are displaced syrians  ankara’s deteriorating economy and pressure on erdoğan himself has underpinned crisis fears hostility has risen noticeably in the aegean and eastern mediterranean where belligerent rhetoric from turkey has been backed by brazen overflights over greek isles and alleged harassment of patrol boats  bilateral tensions come against a backdrop of disquieting reports of greek authorities forcibly sending refugees back to turkey allegations of expulsions have mounted in recent months with human rights activists accusing the government of exploiting the pandemic to engage in extrajudicial deportation of asylum seekers  “we are concerned about recent reports that have reached unhcr of informal forced returns at greece’s borders over land and sea” said boris cheshirkov the agency’s spokesperson in athens describing the allegations as credible  coronavirus cases among refugees on lesbos spark fresh calls for evacuation read more  “we have received reports of testimonies … and have approached authorities to express our concern and ask them to investigate and correct these practices if they are confirmed”  human rights groups claim conditions in island camps have also worsened as a result of restrictive measures to stem the spread of the virus although lockdown policies have gradually been lifted across greece they are still enforced in holding centres with night curfews still in place  “we have seen a noticeable rise in all sorts of violence from tent violence to sexual violence because people are forced to spend much more time in camps” said apostolos veizis the medical director of médecins sans frontières in greece “these people are not treated as human but numbers the situation for them is utterly inhumane”

looked up at his feverish face she gasped she made him run out and grab his shoes then ordered him to bed  paul spent the first day in his parents’ bed filling in roy rogers colouring books but even as his fever soared and aching pains blossomed in his limbs the family doctor advised his parents not to take him to hospital it was clear that he had polio but there were just too many patients there the doctor said paul had a better chance of recovering at home  over the next few days the boy’s condition worsened five days after he had walked into the kitchen barefoot paul could no longer hold a

performed an emergency tracheotomy to suction out the congestion in his lungs that his paralysed body couldn’t shift  three days later paul woke up his body was encased in a machine that wheezed and sighed he couldn’t move he couldn’t speak he couldn’t cough he couldn’t see through the fogged windows of the steam tent – a vinyl hood that kept the air around his head moist and the mucus in his lungs loose he thought he was dead  when the tent was eventually removed all he could see were the heads of other children their bodies encased in metal canisters nurses in starched white uniforms and caps floating between them “as far as you can see rows and rows of iron lungs full of children” he recalled recently  facebook twitter pinterest children in iron lungs during a polio outbreak in the us in the 1950s photograph science history imagesalamy stock photo  the next 18 months were torture although he couldn’t talk because of the tracheotomy he could hear the cries of other children in pain he lay for hours in his own waste because he couldn’t tell the staff he needed to be cleaned he nearly drowned in his own mucus his parents visited almost every day but his existence was unrelentingly boring he and the other children tried to communicate making faces at each other but paul said “every time i’d make a friend they’d die”  paul recovered from the initial infection but polio left him almost completely paralysed from the neck down what his diaphragm could no longer do for him the iron lung did paul lay flat on his back his head resting on a pillow and his body encased in the metal cylinder from the neck down air was sucked out of the cylinder by a set of leather bellows powered by a motor the negative pressure created by the vacuum forced his lungs to expand when the air was pumped back in the change in pressure gently deflated his lungs this was the regular hiss and sigh that kept paul alive he could not leave the lung when medical staff opened it to wash him or manage his bodily functions he had to hold his breath  what paul remembers most vividly about the ward is hearing the doctors talk about him when they walked through on their rounds “he’s going to die today” they said “he shouldn’t be alive” it made him furious it made him want to live  in 1954 when paul was eight his mother got a call from a physical therapist who worked with the march of dimes a us charity dedicated to eradicating polio paul’s months on the polio ward had left him with a fear of doctors and nurses but his mother reassured him and so the therapist mrs sullivan began visiting twice a week  paul told the therapist about the times he had been forced by doctors to try to breathe without the lung how he had turned blue and passed out he also told her about the time he had gulped and “swallowed” some air almost like breathing the technique had a technical name “glossopharyngeal breathing” you trap air in your mouth and throat cavity by flattening the tongue and opening the throat as if you’re saying “ahh” for the doctor with your mouth closed the throat muscle pushes the air down past the vocal cords and into the lungs paul called it “frogbreathing”  facebook twitter pinterest paul alexander in his iron lung photograph allison smiththe guardian  sullivan made a deal with her patient if he could frogbreathe without the iron lung for three minutes she’d give him a puppy it took paul a year to learn to do it but he got his puppy he called her ginger and though he had to think about every breath he got better at it once he could breathe reliably for long enough he could get out of the lung for short periods of time first out on the porch and then into the yard  although he still needed to sleep in the iron lung every night – he couldn’t breathe when he was unconscious – paul didn’t stop at the yard at 21 he became the first person to graduate from a dallas high school without physically attending a class he got into southern methodist university in dallas after repeated rejections by the university administration then into law school at the university of texas at austin for decades paul was a lawyer in dallas and fort worth representing clients in court in a threepiece suit and a modified wheelchair that held his paralysed body upright  at a time when disabled people were less often seen in public – the americans with disabilities act which banned discrimination wouldn’t be passed until 1990 – paul was visible over the course of his life he has been on planes and to strip clubs seen the ocean prayed in church fallen in love lived alone and staged a sitin for disability rights he is charming friendly talkative quick to anger and quick to make a joke  at 74 he is once again confined to the lung fulltime only one other person in the us still uses one the last person to use an iron lung in the uk died in december 2017 at the age of 75 no one expected someone who needed an iron lung to live this long and after surviving one deadly epidemic paul did not expect to find himself threatened by another  poliomyelitis kills by suffocation – not by damaging the lungs as covid19 does but by attacking motor neurons in the spinal cord weakening or severing communication between the central nervous system and the muscles the ensuing paralysis means that the muscles that make it possible to breathe no longer work  polio existed in isolated outbreaks around the world for millennia but it didn’t become epidemic until the 20th century – helped ironically by improvements in sanitation poliovirus enters the body through the mouth via food or water or unwashed hands contaminated with infected faecal matter until the 19th century almost all children would have come in contact with poliovirus before the age of one while they still enjoyed protection from maternal antibodies transferred from mother to baby during pregnancy however as sanitation improved children were less likely to come into contact with poliovirus as babies when they encountered it as older children their immune systems were unprepared  in the us from 1916 onwards each summer brought an epidemic of polio in some part of the nation at its peak in the 40s and 50s the virus was responsible for more than 15000 cases of paralysis in the us each year during this same period it killed or paralysed at least 600000 people annually worldwide the year paul contracted the virus 1952 saw the largest single outbreak of polio in us history almost 58000 cases across the nation of those more than 21000 people – mostly children – were left with varying degrees of disability and 3145 died  facebook twitter pinterest a caregiver adjusts paul’s head rest photograph allison smiththe guardian  though polio was not the most lethal of epidemic diseases it transformed everywhere it touched “it was like the plague it drove everybody mad” paul told me when i first spoke to him last year in places where outbreaks occurred families sheltered in fear at home with the windows shut all kinds of public gathering places closed human interactions were laced with uncertainty according to the historian david oshinsky some people refused to talk on the phone out of concern that the virus could be transmitted down the line during the first major outbreak in new york in 1916 72000 cats and 8000 dogs were killed in one month after a rumour went around that animals transmitted the disease they don’t by the 40s parents had their children perform “polio tests” every day during the summer – touch their toes tuck their chin to their chests checking for pain or weakness – while insurance companies sold “polio insurance” to parents of new babies  before the arrival of a vaccine in 1955 what made polio so terrifying was that there was no way of predicting who would walk away from an infection with a headache and who would never walk again in most cases the disease had no discernible effect of the 30 or so who showed symptoms most experienced only minor illness but a small proportion 45 exhibited serious symptoms including extreme muscular pain high fever and delirium as the virus hacked its way through the neural tissue of the spinal cord a few of those infected were paralysed this progression of the virus was known as paralytic polio roughly 510 of patients who caught paralytic polio died although this number was far higher in the days before widespread use of the iron lung  if we had forgotten the terror of epidemics we are now being forcibly reminded the last time i spoke to paul in april it was over skype from our respective lockdowns – him in his iron lung in an apartment in dallas with a rotating staff of fulltime carers and an amazon echo next to his head and me in my house in surrey england  like polio covid19 can be transmitted by silent carriers who don’t know they have it like polio it has put normal life on hold and just as with polio we are pinning our hopes on a vaccine there is even talk of bringing back the iron lung – a ukbased initiative is trying to bring a new negativepressure ventilator called exovent to hospitals for covid19 patients unlike positivepressure ventilators this smaller iron lung would fit over the patient’s chest allowing them to remain conscious speak eat and take medication orally as a machine breathes for them  “it’s exactly the way it was it’s almost freaky to me” paul said of the parallels between polio and covid19 “it scares me”  though this virus if he gets it will likely kill him life hasn’t changed dramatically for paul since the start of the pandemic he hasn’t been able to venture outside of his lung for more than five minutes in years as one of his friends told me “it’s not a strain for him it’s his life this is mr shelterinplace” i asked paul if he is worried about covid19 “sure sure” he said then he added “well – i don’t sit around and worry about it i’m dying a lot it doesn’t make any difference”  paul’s health has always been precarious but it has declined in the past few years when i first met him in may 2019 he was a longterm inpatient at clements hospital in north dallas more than four months earlier he had developed a persistent respiratory infection which had sent him to hospital he also suffers pain in his legs every time he is moved he had hoped the doctors could help him manage that pain but he told me “it’s not about to go away” looking up from a pillow on a wide board attached to one end of the lung his voice is slow raspy and sometimes punctuated by gasps hearing paul over the machine’s constant sighs requires the listener to focus on him and tune out the lung accordingly he is used to being listened to  next to paul’s head was a clear plastic stick flat and about a foot long with a pen attached to the end of it his father crafted a stick like this when paul was a child and he has been using versions of it since he clamps the end of the stick in his mouth and manipulates the pen to write type and push buttons on the phone he used it to sign the hospital’s waiver allowing him to talk to me although he bristled at having to sign anything at all to tell me his own story “that is the most ridiculous thing” he grumbled paul’s teeth are flattened and worn from years of using the stick though his body inside the lung is scarcely larger than it was when he was a child and his muscles atrophied his neck measures 18 inches around and his jaw muscles bulge  paul’s iron lung – his faithful “old iron horse” as he calls it – is the butteryellow colour of 50s kitchen appliances its metal legs ending in black rubber wheels raise it to a height that suits a caregiver while windows at the top allow them to see inside and four portholes on the sides let them reach in to open the machine which weighs almost 300kg carers must release the seals at the head and slide the user out on the interior bed the portholes the pressure valves the cylindrical shape and the colour all give the impression of a sturdy miniature submarine  facebook twitter pinterest paul inside his iron lung as a child photograph courtesy of paul alexander  iron lungs were built to last even if no one thought the people in them would the device was invented in 1928 by philip drinker a medical engineer and louis shaw a physiologist at harvard drinker had visited boston children’s hospital to investigate a malfunctioning air conditioner in the ward for premature babies but he came away haunted what he saw in the polio ward – “the small blue faces the terrible gasping for air” as his sister and biographer catherine drinker bowen later wrote his invention was a simple mechanism doing the job of depleted muscles and it meant that thousands of children who would have died didn’t the iron lung was intended to be used for two weeks at most to give the body a chance to recover  over time the claustrophobic iron lung became emblematic of the devastating effects of polio only the sickest patients ended up in one if they made it out a lifetime of disability was likely to follow but once the vaccine was administered to children across the us from 1955 incidence of the disease plummeted those who needed shortterm breathing assistance were treated by more invasive but much smaller positivepressure ventilators invented in 1952 by an anaesthetist during a polio outbreak in copenhagen these push air directly into and out of the lungs either through the mouth via a tube that is snaked down the throat while the patient is sedated or through a hole made in the trachea these like the iron lung were only intended for shortterm use those few people who needed help breathing for the rest of their lives saw a hole in their throat as an acceptable price to pay for the increased mobility that positive pressure offered the last iron lungs were manufactured in the late 60s  by the time positivepressure ventilators were in widespread use however paul was used to living in his lung and he had already learned to breathe part of the time without it he also never wanted a hole in his throat again so he kept his iron lung  with the decline of the disease and the visual reminders of it hidden away in a handful of homes and care facilities across much of the western world the terror of polio faded from collective memory “you can’t believe how many people walked into my law office” paul said “and saw my iron lung and said ‘what is that’ and i’d tell them ‘it’s an iron lung’ ‘what does it do’ ‘breathe for me’ ‘why’ ‘i got polio when i was little’ ‘what’s polio’ uh oh” david oshinsky the author of polio an american story believes that the success of vaccines in eradicating so many deadly diseases is precisely why the antivaxx movement has gained ground in recent years “these vaccines have done away with the evidence of how frightening these diseases were” he told me  when i visited him at clements hospital paul seemed like a kind of medical celebrity – none of the hospital staff had ever seen an iron lung before as we talked two women in nurses’ scrubs came in they were from another unit but they just wanted to meet the man in the iron lung they said paul told them that he was in the middle of an interview “that’s all right sir” the older nurse said “we’ll just listen for a bit” after they left paul told me this happens all the time “that’s the way it is – like living in a zoo” he said  people often come away from meeting paul humbled norman brown a retired nurse who has been good friends with paul since 1971 said “the guy is such an impressive character … most people are in awe when they first meet him” paul doesn’t mind answering people’s questions “i’m a lawyer i’m paid to talk” he likes talking about polio and the lung and about his life because what terrifies him even more than the possibility of covid19 is that the world will forget what polio was like and what he achieved in spite of it  on christmas eve 1953 a year and a half after paul was admitted to parkland hospital his parents rented a portable generator and a truck to bring him and his iron lung home it was a short nervewracking drive “any minute it looked like that old generator would go off” his father gus later told a texas newspaper “it kept popping i didn’t know if we would make it home or not” part of the reason paul was cleared to leave the hospital was that no one expected him to live much longer  but paul didn’t die he gained weight the day he got home his older brother made him a plate of bacon – the best he’d ever tasted he said his parents slept in the same groundfloor living room with him always halfawake in case the swishswish of the machine stopped it did during power cuts – even today texan storms and tornadoes sometimes knock down power lines – and his parents had to pump the machine by hand calling neighbours in to help  after three years paul could leave his lung for a few hours at a time his frogbreathing had become muscle memory – like riding a bicycle he told me his education had been left to founder during his 18 months on the ward one day his mother walked in with a pile of books borrowed from the local elementary school she was going to teach him to read  paul as a young man outside his iron lung photograph courtesy of paul alexander  “i had all these ambitions i was going to be president” he said but it took his parents along with the parents of several other disabled children more than a year to convince the dallas school system to allow him to take classes from home in 1959 when he was 13 paul was one of the first students to enrol in the district’s new programme for children at home “i knew if i was going to do anything with my life it was going to have to be a mental thing i wasn’t going to be a basketball player” he told me  most days he would leave the lung around the time other children got out of school and sit out front in his wheelchair friends would push him around the streets later as they got older the same friends took him to diners and cinemas then restaurants and bars  and he went to church the pentecostal church to which the alexanders belong is a denomination characterised by a personal passionate experience of god at the end of each service congregants are invited to come to the front of the church and pray “my dad would take me down there sometimes to pray with him and he would let all of his emotions out then” paul’s younger brother phil told me “he’d just cry and cry”  paul dealt with his emotions in a different way polio had robbed him of his independence “he let his anger out a lot he had a mouth” phil recalled “i completely understand it he would yell and scream and curse and get it all out and my parents would just let it happen because obviously paul would need a release … he was normal” it hurts paul to think about it now “there were frustrating times times i’d get really mad scream but mom and dad were so tolerant they seemed to just understand” he said as he spoke tears trickled down his temple to the pillow  in 1967 paul now 21 graduated from high school with almost straight as his one b was in biology because he was unable to dissect a rat “i was so mad” he said he still is he applied to southern methodist university in dallas but despite his academic record he was rejected “i was too crippled” he said bitterly “broke my heart i fought for two years repeatedly called them “‘well wait a minute’ i’d say ‘i want you to reconsider think about this i’m coming over i want to talk to you’” his high school teachers backed him eventually the dean of admissions relented on two conditions that he find someone to help him get to his classes and that he get the polio vaccine  facebook twitter pinterest paul reflected in a mirror attached to his iron lung photograph allison smiththe guardian  paul was “scared to death” rolling into his first class “you have to understand back then there were no cripples there was none on campus i was the only one wherever i went i was the only one restaurant movie theatre – i thought ‘wow there’s nobody else out here i’ll just pave the way’” he said “i kind of thought of myself as representing a group i fought for that reason ‘what do you mean i can’t go back there i want to go back there’ … ‘you can’t do that’ ‘oh yes i can’ i was always fighting”  paul met a woman claire and fell in love they got engaged but one day when he called her mother – who had long objected to the relationship – answered refused to let him talk to her and told him never to speak to her daughter again “took years to heal from that” he said he transferred to the university of texas at austin at southern methodist university he’d been living at home but now he was on his own his parents were terrified  at ut the caregiver paul had hired never turned up so for a month the guys in his dorm took care of him – even “the most intimate things” he said – until he was able to hire a new one paul graduated in 1978 and later began studying for a postgraduate degree in law he again made headlines in november 1980 “ironwilled man leaves iron lung to vote” declared an article in the austin american statesman newspaper  paul struggled with trying to pay for a fulltime carer and his education at the same time but in 1984 he graduated from the university of austin with a degree in law and found a job teaching legal terminology to court stenographers at an austin trade school when a newspaper reporter asked if his students found it uncomfortable to be in his class he responded “i don’t allow people to feel uncomfortable for very long”  he passed his bar exams and on 19 may 1986 he slightly raised his right thumb as he took the oath promising to conduct himself with integrity as a lawyer in front of the chief justice of the supreme court of texas he was 40 years old wearing a natty threepiece suit living on his own and able to spend most of his day outside the machine that still kept him alive  the story of how paul taught himself to breathe is central to how he thinks about himself it represents the determination that made everything else – getting into university the law degree the life of relative independence – possible it even inspired the title of the memoir three minutes for a dog that he selfpublished in april it took him more than eight years to write it using the plastic stick and a pen to tap out his story on the keyboard or dictating the words to his friend former nurse norman brown  but the title of the book was kathy gaines’s idea kathy 62 has been alexander’s caregiver since he graduated from law school and moved to the dallasfort worth area although neither can remember precisely when she found his advert in the paper and became his “arms and legs”  kathy is a type1 diabetic and as a consequence of the disease has been legally blind for years so she can’t drive during paul’s fivemonth stay in hospital last year she took the bus or got a lift there every day she taught the nursing staff how to manage the machine and to some degree paul while we talked kathy brought us foam cups of hospital coffee and a plastic bendy straw for paul she left it close enough for him to reach with his tongue and mouth but not so close as to be in the way kathy knows how to shave paul’s face change his clothes and sheets trim his hair and his nails hand him his toothbrush do his paperwork make his appointments do his grocery shopping and that when he says “biscuit” he usually means “english muffin” sometimes if she sees his head in a position that she thinks will be uncomfortable for him she’ll move it without asking he doesn’t always appreciate that  kathy knows everything about him paul says “kathy and i grew together … she stretched herself over as many things as i needed” he said for most of their relationship kathy has either lived with paul or nearly next door they’ve moved a lot his legal career was not lucrative and he has struggled financially today kathy lives upstairs in their communal apartment building she sees him every day whether she’s working or not  though kathy and paul have never been romantically involved his brother phil describes their relationship like a marriage “paul has always been aggressive about things that he wants and needs around other people” he said “he’s pretty demanding but kathy is more demanding than he is they’ve had their moments but they always work it out”  paul has always craved independence but his life depends on his caregivers showing up for work on his iron lung not blowing a gasket on the electricity staying on “he’s been 100 depending on the kindness of others since he was six years old – 100 and he’s done it by virtue of his voice and his demeanour and his ability to communicate” said norman brown “i would do things for him that i wouldn’t do for people for example he got evicted from an apartment and he says ‘i want to egg that manager’s door’ and when he says ‘i want to do something’ he means you’re going to do it so we got a bunch of eggs and drove over to that manager’s apartment” brown said laughing  what paul hates is being invisible he remembers going to restaurants where the server asked his companion “what will he be having” his voice shook with anger at the memory “i think it’s why i fight so hard because there’s people standing there with the gall to tell me what i’m going to do with my life … you have no right to tell me what to do” he said “you should get down on your knees and thank god it wasn’t you”  paul has now outlived both his parents and his older brother nick he has outlived his old friends he has even outlived his original iron lung in 2015 the seals were failing and it was leaking air not surprisingly spare parts for iron lungs and mechanics who know what they’re looking at are difficult to find but after a friend posted a video of paul on youtube asking for help a local dallas engineer fixed him up with a refurbished one  paul still has big plans – he has hopes that his memoir is “going to smack across the world” – but covid19 is a new danger paul is phil said “probably the most vulnerable you can get” to a virus like this one “he’s staying positive but we’ve also had conversations that this is probably going to do it it’s very likely”  paul has always thought that polio the “demon” that tried to destroy him was going to come back “i can see hospitals inundated by polio victims again an epidemic i can see it so easily i tell the doctors it’s going to happen they don’t believe me” he told me when he was in hospital last year  the past six weeks have been unlike anything i’ve known a gp on how the pandemic has changed his work read more  it is only thanks to concerted vaccination efforts that there hasn’t been a new case of polio in the us since 1979 or in the uk since 1984 by 2000 the world health organization had declared all of the americas and the western pacific region poliofree india which had seen 200000 cases of polio a year through the 1990s was declared poliofree in 2014 after a series of aggressive vaccination campaigns the virus is now only endemic to three countries in the world – afghanistan nigeria and pakistan – and cases of polio number in the dozens  but paul was right that most people have largely forgotten about the terror of polio just as we have forgotten the terror of other diseases we now routinely vaccinate against – diphtheria typhus measles and mumps and that could be fertile ground for their return if we do not remain vigilant it’s hard to imagine in the middle of this pandemic that we’ll forget covid19 too but we might it’s hard to remember our nightmares the day after the lesson of polio – and of every time we are confronted by our own terrible fragility and survive – is that sometimes we need to remember    • follow the long read on twitter at gdnlongread and sign up to the long read weekly email

would be to leave syria’s rebelheld idlib province for an exotic holiday abroad  instead in march the 22yearold signed up with turkish military recruiters and travelled over the border to turkey from there he took his first ever plane journey to libya where he is now fighting on a dangerous frontline in someone else’s war  “they told me i would be in the support line or medical units working for good money but the fighting here is worse than anything i experienced in syria it’s all close combat in narrow streets” he said  “some syrians are here for money some say they support the libyans against tyranny but personally i don’t really know why turkey asked the syrian opposition to fight in libya i didn’t know anything about this country except the revolution against col muammar gaddafi”

gaddafi’s mould he is supported by the uae and russian paramilitary organisation the wagner group along with egypt saudi arabia jordan france and a ragtag collection of sudanese and more recently

gaddafi in 2011  gen khalifa haftar photograph lnaafpgetty  by the end of 2019 realising that lna forces were on the verge of seizing the capital tripoli the turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan took the bold step of declaring overt support for the gna signing new agreements on both maritime boundaries and military cooperation which neatly countered turkey’s strategic enemies across the mediterranean  “the gna was short on military and diplomatic support but it’s definitely not short of oil money yet” said anas el gomati the director of the tripolibased sadeq institute thinktank “this was a smart move on ankara’s part by propping up tripoli turkey is looking to recoup billions of dollars in unfinished construction contracts signed under gaddafi and get in first when it comes

485,stephin merritt of the magnetic fields i used to live in a commune where music was forbidden,stephin merritt has just spent six weeks confined to his manhattan apartment after contracting coronavirus he was ill for 10 days then recovered he’s usually a crazily prolific songwriter – two of his band’s most celebrated albums 50 song memoir and 69 love songs obviously contain 119 songs between them – but he hasn’t come up with any new numbers for magnetic fields since he got ill the problem is that he can only write songs in bars and not just any bar – it needs to be “onethird full of cranky old gay men gossiping over thumping disco music” plus he needs a glass of cognac to be slowly sipped and a corner with a light so he can see his notebook  fortunately before the outbreak he was able to find a place that fulfilled these conditions and the result is the magnetic fields’ latest album like most of merritt’s records there’s a concept – on this one titled quickies all the songs but one are two minutes 15 seconds or less however that’s not an unusual length for a magnetic fields tune – as merritt points out over the phone onethird of the songs on 69 love songs would qualify  is it ingrained in him that this is the perfect length for a pop song “it’s ingrained in everyone in gen x or earlier” he says “it used to be that seveninch singles were 2 mins 50 in length maximum – this is before bohemian rhapsody and such epics were considered singles” it’s much more rare for him to write a song that lasts around five minutes “that’s long to me yes both in my tastes and musical output i like bubblegum and experimental music so i’m comfortable with two minutes and i’m comfortable with six hours”  this is a relatively loquacious answer for merritt whose laconic baritone has had many interviewers tearing their hair out when i mention his longstanding interest in brevity – he cowrote a book 101 twoletter words with the new yorker cartoonist roz chast inspired by the shortest words you can use in scrabble – his entire answer is “hm”  facebook twitter pinterest merritt performing with the magnetic fields in barcelona 2012 photograph jordi vidalredferns via getty images  he’s hilarious if you don’t mind protracted awkward silences – a man of passionately held if quietly expressed views don’t get him started on bonus tracks “i’ve always hated bonus tracks the whole idea bugs me either it’s an album or it’s not an album it gets my asperger’s up to even think about it” does he really have asperger’s “i don’t know i refuse to ask for a diagnosis but my various friends with asperger’s swear i do yes”  as well as brevity it’s merritt’s way with a lyric that makes the songs on quickies extraordinary it’s hard to imagine anyone else writing tracks called you’ve got a friend in beelzebub i wish i were a prostitute again and the biggest tits in history merritt says that i wish i were a prostitute again is something a couple of his friends have regularly lamented “they both harp on it a lot i have heard a whole lot of the lyrics to this song verbatim but clearly it’s an exaggeration of what they actually do” the song includes dressing up as king tut betty boop and the turin shroud and selling one’s “urine” and “poop”  it would be illegal for me to express my actual political opinions in probably any country in the world  then there’s the song the day the politicians died which describes global revelry breaking out in response to the event of the title a bit extreme “it’s a little less extreme than what i think about politicians” merritt counters “it would be illegal for me to express my actual political opinions in probably any country in the world and i definitely wouldn’t be allowed to travel”  he pauses – again – and then elaborates “in reaction to donald trump’s suggestion that people ingest disinfectants howard stern suggested that there should be a trump rally in which his supporters drink disinfectants and quote all drop dead unquote i admire howard stern for being able to say these things and keep his job i also completely endorse that sentiment”  magnetic fields fans know more about merritt than we usually would about a musician his previous album 50 song memoir had a lyric about each year in his life he’s now 55 and detailed everything from his eccentric mother – who gave away all her money and joined newage cults dragging her son with her around the us – to the many odd illnesses he has been plagued with the most debilitating is hyperacusis an acute sensitivity to certain sounds which would make it impossible for merritt to play with an amplified rock band – magnetic fields gigs are much quieter affairs  merritt believes he all but destroyed his hearing watching the industrial band einstürzende neubauten play a gig in new york in the early 80s when i interviewed him 16 years ago for the cult gay magazine butt a publication for which he also posed naked he told me “i was standing too close to the circular saw being scraped across corrugated metal and listening to the incredible sounds in my own ear of what i now realise was my hearing being damaged”  though quickies is mainly fiction – one song is called i wish i had fangs and a tail – merritt’s life has still informed it i note that there are two songs about the sinful allure of dancing evil rhythm and the price you pay and suggest that dancing is a theme on the record “and all other popular music yes” comes the reply  merritt takes pity on me and elaborates “when i was young i lived against my will on a tibetan buddhist commune in vermont where music was forbidden music distracts you from enlightenment or something but i was – also against my will – made to grow up in boston for a while which had a long history of puritanism where all sorts of things have been banned one of those being music another being theatre and i am heir to all sorts of puritanical impulses also my mother was a radical feminist acolyte of mary daly who i have relentlessly satirised in a number of songs including kill a man a week” – another song on quickies “that’s really not an exaggeration of mary daly’s actual opinion it’s only a reductio ad absurdum but not actually an exaggeration”  facebook twitter pinterest merritt around the time of 69 love songs photograph circus records  the magnetic fields’ first single came out in 1991 by the late 90s merritt’s songwriting was already revered in the music press before 69 love songs released in the us in 1999 showcased the range of merritt’s talents to a wider public ranging from songs about horny puppies to sharp attempts to fathom the nature of love itself it’s still a monumental record that is destined to overshadow the rest of merritt’s work – which he doesn’t mind since that was the intention like all his records it ranged stylistically from folk to jangly postpunk to fleetwood macinspired aor and even ace of basestyle swedish reggae though some genres – particularly rock – are always offlimits  quickies of course is being released in the teeth of the pandemic and merritt is brutal about the implications for his career “we’ve already postponed our us tour from june to january and i don’t know if january’s realistic at this point so it may have simply ended my concert career we don’t know”  what would happen if you couldn’t play live “well i would probably have to get a job but i would actually be relieved that i didn’t have to perform any more because i’ve never been a big fan of performing” like most musicians merritt won’t be able to get by on streams and record sales alone “the money in the music industry is mainly in concerts at this point”  it all spells trouble for gigging musicians “mediumsize mass gatherings will be the last thing to come back” he predicts “i see no reason why there can’t be big outdoor festivals but we really really don’t do big outdoor festivals – we have a cello although i guess we could just have the cellist switch to bass guitar”  and then you could rock out i joke – since if the choice was between making rock music and surviving or staying pop and perishing merritt would choose the latter every time  “i don’t begin to know where to go with that” he replies  • quickies is out now the vinyl version on five seveninch eps is out on 29 may as is the cd
486,britt ekland i was put through emotional and psychological warfare,two days after their first date – which was also their first meeting – the comedian peter sellers gave britt ekland a dachshund puppy called pepper  ekland had just arrived in london from sweden to be 20th century fox’s next big star she was 21 years old and living at the dorchester hotel a dog was a ridiculous gift she says so was sellers’ previous largesse – every bloom in the hotel’s flower shop “that was the way he wooed me”  just 10 days after their first date ekland and sellers – 17 years her senior – were married and the puppy was lost in the whirlwind “all these years i always wondered what happened to pepper” says ekland now 77 two weeks ago she found out a woman wrote to ekland’s agent saying she had taken pepper and that he lived a “long and happy life” ekland sighs audibly relieved  although she lives mostly in sweden and los angeles ekland was in the uk touring in the play the cat and the canary when the coronavirus hit she is coping well in lockdown in london walking her dog and cleaning but as a “totally nonessential worker” life has slowed dramatically  ekland’s career began when she was a teenager appearing in chewing gum adverts and doing modelling jobs she would go on to become one of the mostphotographed women of the 1970s as sellers’ young bride roger moore’s bond girl in the man with the golden gun and in highprofile relationships with the record exec lou adler and rock stars rod stewart phil lewis and slim jim phantom  that she remains so prolific today – a fixture of reality television talkshows and the panto circuit – is down to her work ethic “if you want publicity you’ve got to do something to deserve publicity” she says even since lockdown began she has appeared in bbc one’s the real marigold hotel where a group of older celebrities live out a retirement fantasy in india and in the bbc two documentary peter sellers a state of comic ecstasy about the comedian’s mental health problems and his alcohol and substance misuse that ekland is still best known as sellers’ former wife is testament to the star power – and infamous intensity – of their pairing  they met in january 1964 after sellers saw ekland’s photograph in the newspaper and sent his valet round to her room as he put it once “i thought that i would like to meet what i saw”  ekland with peter sellers photograph allan grantthe life images collection via getty images  ekland knew his name only from gossip magazines as a beauty pageant judge who had reportedly tried it on with miss sweden she wore “a lot” of clothes to go to his suite she says wryly she thought sellers worldly and suave but she “didn’t have a clue” about his career when sellers realised he suggested a trip to the cinema – to see the pink panther in which he played inspector clouseau “this wasn’t about you telling him about yourself” says ekland “this was about him telling you”  his marriage proposal if you can call it that was similarly brazen about a week after they met ekland left for new york sellers called her “he said ‘i’ve told the press we’re getting married is that ok with you’ i didn’t know what to say even to this day i don’t know what i said”  ekland says she wasn’t the type to look for red flags she describes herself as wilful and “extremely impulsive … i’m like a steamroller – i just go forward i don’t have that stopper in me … someone falls down in front of me then i fall in love with him” as a teenager in stockholm she “fell in love every five seconds” once writing in her diary in blood while playing tchaikovsky’s swan lake “you had a bit of a snog then it was over so you wrote in blood” ekland says pragmatically when i bring it up  her father was delighted when she married sellers despite the age gap “fame overcomes a lot of things” she says drily not that he could have stopped her she was “deliriously happy” “madly in love” and soon to be a big star  then she says “it all came crashing down” days after their wedding sellers flew to los angeles for a film and sent her a threepage letter obsessing that she might leave him or be unfaithful and saying he wanted to have “violent” sex with her it was signed with 25 kisses  sellers urged ekland to join him for easter waving away her commitments to shoot the film guns at batasi she acquiesced within days of her arrival in los angeles he had the first of a series of heart attacks “by the following sunday he was on life support” ekland’s parents flew out to join her and she learned to drive between sellers’ mansion and the hospital “i prayed to god a lot even though i’m not a religious person … just hoping and believing that he would pull through” he did and their daughter victoria was born in january 1965  by then ekland had been fired by fox for breach of contract for leaving guns at batasi and knew about sellers’ dark side in company he was “the joker the fabulous comedian” she says sarcastically “he kept the table going for hours … everyone loved him ‘such a fun evening’” the question she has been asked most in her life is “how fun was peter sellers at home”  ekland with rod stewart in 1975 photograph keystonegetty images  in truth he was “very possessive and very very moody” he would threaten ekland with divorce then just as capriciously make up and fly into jealous rages the abuse was never physical – if it had been ekland says she “might have left sooner … i know that sounds horrible but i’m just being practical” did she see the relationship as abusive at all she hesitates “well i realised it wasn’t right – someone putting me through emotional and psychological warfare”  once hugh hefner told sellers he had nude pictures of ekland as a ploy to get sellers a keen photographer to supply some himself ekland who was always “very prudish” knew it was a bluff “i never purposely posed halfnaked” even shooting films she would cover herself up with black camera tape – “however painful it was to take off” she scoffs to hear herself described as a sex symbol “i don’t know what a ‘sex symbol’ is”    sure enough hefner’s smoking gun showed ekland with scarcely a bare shoulder but sellers had not believed her “it was just horrifying that he should accuse me of something that was so very far from who i was”  no fight was too petty says ekland “if i spoke to my mother in swedish that would be a huge rant for hours like this …” she mimics an unintelligible screeching tirade “he never took a pause” ekland confided in the actor nanette newman and her husband the director bryan forbes – the couple’s closest friends in hollywood “one night i just got in the car and drove to them to seek shelter … this continued throughout my marriage”  it all ended as abruptly as it began after dinner at the excelsior hotel in rome ekland permitted the paparazzi to take their photograph enraging sellers in their room his “highpitched waffling” went on all night prompting noise complaints  with sellers in the 1965 film after the fox photograph mondadori portfoliomondadori via getty images  “eventually at 5am i’d been so traumatised i couldn’t take any more” says ekland some accounts say she took a valium “and he suddenly just said ‘that’s it you’re out of here’” sellers called the couple’s agent who took ekland to another hotel nearby “where i hid until i got the flight to sweden” there she was reunited with victoria then about five who had been in the uk with her nanny  sellers made several efforts to reconcile but says ekland “i knew that this was it – i’d had enough” only someone “mentally superstrong” could have withstood four years she adds they divorced in december 1968  sellers died of a heart attack in 1980 although he was never diagnosed ekland believes him to have had bipolar disorder though she has disputed accounts of sellers’ alcohol and cocaine dependency she told the recent bbc two documentary that he was unable to get help for his mental health problems “because he was such a valuable asset”  i’m the proudest bond girl there is because there are not a lot of us left  ekland has only ever sought help for her mental health once – in the 80s after her mother died of alzheimer’s aged 78 although she disliked her father she and her mother were very close “wherever i worked she always came” ekland was prescribed antidepressants after her loss but stopped taking them after three days  she is used to getting on with things “i am so used to taking care of myself i don’t need anyone to do anything for me” her most recent marriage to the stray cats drummer slim jim phantom ended after eight years in 1992 after three children by three partners ekland was preaching “selfpartnership” long before emma watson back when there really was a stigma  “i’ve always been a modern woman and i still am” says ekland now that said she is scathing of some modern women – specifically social media influencers without naming names she says she pities “those poor plasticine models … throwing themselves explicitly over their instagrams all that effort for such little payback”    even bond girls do not make the same impact today says ekland “i’m the proudest bond girl there is because there are not a lot of us left and there won’t be any in future” she has said modern bond girls have it harder than she did there now being “so many demands” – she believes imposed by political correctness    “the bond girl has to look good in a bikini that was her role … the bond girl of my era exists no more because they’re not presented that way you wouldn’t see her in a bikini next to daniel craig in a suit today – the pr department would make sure that didn’t happen”  ekland in a publicity shot for the man with the golden gun photograph united artistsallstar  ekland also brushes off beauty standards as a factor in her historical embrace of cosmetic surgery once outspoken in her praise of it for over40s “i think it’s wonderful” it is now among her biggest regrets thanks to a botched lip procedure in 1994 “excruciatingly painful” corrective attempts “to try to melt the stuff” injected into her lips have not been quite successful – as is “constantly” pointed out on social media says ekland exasperatedly “to all the people who say ‘she’s destroyed her face’ – yes i didn’t do that purposely i don’t want to look like this but i have no choice i’ve learned to live with it so you’d better learn to live with it”  until “a few years ago” ekland observes ironically “i was always striving to look older” she credits her youthful appearance with keeping her from the predation in hollywood exposed by metoo “i knew that was going on but i was never in the inner circles where it was gossiped about … men were a little bit intimidated by the naivety of me i think they’d just look at me and say ‘she’s so young – we can’t touch her’”  today ekland is grandmother to sevenyearold cash and threeyearold lucas – born to her second child nic adler in los angeles months after he was born lucas was found to have adrenoleukodystrophy an untreatable genetic condition that causes progressive degeneration of the brain in boys and is often terminal lucas’s early diagnosis from routine newborn screening in california allowed for early interventions ekland has since become a patron for the uk leukodystrophy charity alex tlc to campaign for the condition to be added to the birth screen in the uk “so that all these boys have a future”    when she will next be able to see her family in person is a concern – but as ever ekland takes a pragmatic view “i’m very much a person who lives for the day today i feel good nothing is really horrible … so i find that i’m lucky” for now her plans are only to write back to the woman who took in her dog 56 years ago “and find out exactly what happened” but says ekland emphatically “the only thing i care about is that pepper had a wonderful life”
487,one giant leap meet the new generation of male ballet stars,‘it’s a golden era of male ballet dancers” so says emma cahusac the commissioning editor behind a new documentary men at the barre part of bbc four’s dance season it’s not just hyperbole the young men rising up at the royal ballet are some of the most exciting in dance right now principals matthew ball and marcelino sambé first soloists cesar corrales and william bracewell and first artist joseph sissens all feature in men at the barre with the majority of them british or uktrained it’s a giant leap from the grumblings of a decade ago about the lack of local dancers making it to the top  i spoke to ball corrales and sambé by phone all staying resolutely positive during this enforced break from their intensive dancing lives but all desperate to get back to work with colleagues they’re certain are something special “i see so much beauty and so much strength and power in that company” says sambé “there has been a surge in this younger generation” says ball  why this wealth of talent has arrived right now isn’t easy to pinpoint but they definitely spur each other on there’s healthy competition – ballet boys can’t resist a pirouetteoff corrales’ record is “at least 15” – but they all talk about how secure they feel because each dancer is very different  facebook twitter pinterest cesar corrales in mayerling at the royal opera house london photograph tristram kentonthe guardian  liverpoolborn ball 26 who trained at the royal ballet school from the age of 11 is the tall athletepoet with a flair for drama he took leave from the royal ballet to make a dazzlingly seductive turn in matthew bourne’s swan lake and his interests lie in character and storytelling “he’s almost dancing with his brain” says sambé “there’s always something so intense going on he’s bubbling bubbling bubbling”  ball and sambé have been friends since the latter joined the royal ballet upper school at 16 “marcelino is so full of energy and vivacity and life” says ball “that’s his personality and his dancing matches that when you see him move it’s like a fish to water it just makes sense” sambé’s joy as he springs and bounds has made him an outright audience favourite although he admits his beaming smile was originally a mechanism for coping with nerves “the one thing that made me feel comfortable was a big smile to connect with the audience” he says  all those negative comments the bullying gave me the power and explosiveness to become who i am today cesar corrales  corrales at 23 is the virtuoso prodigy the son of cuban ballet dancers raised in canada he joined english national ballet aged 17 was a principal at 20 and moved to the royal two years ago “he’s a real firecracker” says ball “he certainly pushes us to achieve one more centimetre higher or an extra turn people often talk about british dancers being controlled or mannered and that’s something i personally don’t want to buy into”  a notable line in men at the barre comes from ballet master christopher carr who was a dancer in the royal ballet in the era of rudolf nureyev he says that if nureyev was around now he wouldn’t be such a big star “there are now better dancers” corrales takes issue with that “nureyev was on another planet” he says but it’s true that while nureyev was ahead of his time and had blazing power and charisma there are technically better dancers with every generation the expectations on young dancers now are much greater than their predecessors everything is bigger faster higher training draws on hitech sports science and they must master not only the exactitudes of classical technique but be versatile enough to perform the most contortive contemporary moves they don’t just follow directions either but help develop movement with choreographers “it’s very different to other generations” says corrales “you need to have that skill of contributing bringing ideas to the table”  facebook twitter pinterest matthew ball the conductor marcelino sambé the instrument and lauren cuthbertson the cellist in the cellist by cathy marston at the royal opera house photograph tristram kentonthe guardian  with two ballet dancers for parents corrales had the genes and the setup for a smooth career path in cuba dancers are revered with footballerlike status but growing up in canada he experienced bullying “especially since i was the smallest in the class” he says he could laugh because “they just had no clue” about dance but at the same time he thinks that spurred him on to literally jump higher “all those negative comments the bullying in school from a young age gave me that power and explosiveness to become who i am today”  the teasing corrales experienced probably chimes with most people’s expectations about the lingering stigma attached to boys who do ballet – mocking comments made by us television presenter lara spencer about prince george doing ballet feature in men at the barre but it’s not everyone’s experience ball whose mother is a dance teacher remembers “leaving school halfway through the day to go and audition in london and all the lads giving me high fives and wishing me good luck i was actually quite supported which some people might be surprised by especially in liverpool which is such a football city”  unlike ball and corrales sambé doesn’t come from a dancing background from a poor family in lisbon his constructionworker father died when he was eight and he was fostered by another family with a daughter at the lisbon conservatory where sambé studied his earliest dance experience was in african dance and he first saw ballet on youtube he wouldn’t have found his calling without it he says especially seeing black dancers such as carlos acosta “an incredible moment thinking yeah of course you can do this”  facebook twitter pinterest from left marcelino sambé francesca hayward cesar corrales mayara magri and matthew ball at the royal opera house in january photograph dave m benettgetty images  the internet has inevitably had a huge impact on this generation of dancers and on the reach of an art form previously confined to the stage having a social media profile is part of the job for dancers now and the combination of gorgeous bodies and photogenic grit and strength has turned out to be catnip for brands looking for ambassadors and influencers the dancers’ instagram accounts reveal superhuman tricks and offstage candour sambé has an account dedicated to his beautiful backstage shots of colleagues you can check out how they’ve all been spending lockdown corrales and principal dancer girlfriend francesca hayward giddily laughing their way through multiple pirouettes ball and his partner fellow dancer mayara magri filming their plyometric fitness routine in the park when we speak ball has just taken delivery of a shoulder rig for his camera using the time off to explore his other creative interests – he thinks there’s a lot of potential to better capture dance on film  sambé has been painting and gardening he tells me and working on his own choreography some of which can be seen in a film made prelockdown with cloakroom magazine all undulating muscles and sharp turns it’s a hint of what’s to come the choreography connecting to sambé’s first experience in african dance a meshing of dance identities he wants to pursue “to be able to explore incredible ballet dancers’ bodies doing this kind of movement i think will be really cool”  ballet can be so much more than its traditional image insists sambé but it means this generation breaking out of the ballet bubble “i believe the art form is still in its infancy” he says “and there’s so much more to explore we need to look out at what is happening in the world from politics to arts and bring that into the ballet world” more than ever young dancers aren’t just empty vessels he says “there are so many layers to being an artist this way the process is so rich and intense and visceral the sacrifice brings such a specific grain and incredible strength i feel there’s a misconception that we all just go on stage and look pretty but no there’s so much more”
488,how to write a selfisolation sitcom – according to an inbetweener,not going out stuck indoors with the same old people every day life under corona lockdown probably already feels like a perpetual – albeit rather dark – sitcom so what better time to try to actually turn it into one but how do you ensure you’re a royle family and not a mrs brown’s boys we grabbed iain morris cocreator of the inbetweeners and brand new footballbased sitcom the first team for some handy dos and don’ts of penning the perfect laughfest during lockdown  do think of some characters  if you are looking for comedic characters your very own family is a great place to start “friday night dinner is a perfect example of how you could write a sitcom about a family in lockdown” says morris “if you said they were in lockdown you wouldn’t be far off half the episodes good sitcom characters often feel like they’re stuck in a situation that they are too good for basil fawlty captain mainwaring and alan partridge all think ‘i’m better than this’ foibles are good especially when the characters’ selfperception is totally misguided just look at david brent”  the guide staying in – sign up for our home

inbetweeners and the first team cocreator and i worked as producers at channel 4” says morris “we lived together and would regale each other with embarrassing stories from our youth that became the inbetweeners i thought of the idea for our new sitcom the first team when i sat next to a professional footballer on a flight to la to see my nowwife he was really nice and told me lots of things i didn’t realise footballers only train for a few hours a day so he had all this money and time and he couldn’t play any extra sport in case he got injured he was just hanging out at libraries with all this energy trying to work out what to do all day i thought the idea of living in a gilded cage was really interesting”  don’t get distracted  working from home is a cinch provided you don’t have children or access to netflix or plan to actually do any work “i’ve spent the last 20 years trying to write a novel” says morris “i still haven’t got round to that i have done a zoom kickboxing class i’ve been trying to teach my fouryearold son the piano even though he’s never expressed any interest in playing the piano and i don’t know how to play the piano myself we’ve done a lot of lego if you want to test your patience try doing lego with a young child not interfering takes a zenmaster level of patience we also tried papiermache modelling which ended up as this halfcollapsed wet balloon i had to beg him not to show it for show and tell and reveal what a complete failure his father is at arts and crafts”  do get a good writing partner  humour is subjective but it can be helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off and tell you whether it’s a good idea to introduce say a new catchphrase “hello newman” – yes “bazinga” or “ooh betty” – definitely not “writing a sitcom with someone else means you can always ask them whether something’s funny” says morris “damon and i have definitely fallen in love with the characters we’ve created if that doesn’t sound too pretentious when we’re writing we can’t wait to hear the words coming out of their mouths i still think of ideas that would have been perfect for the inbetweeners like a story about someone who lived in the countryside and couldn’t buy condoms so he used those plastic bag wrappers you get around bread i was like ‘yep maybe we should bring the inbetweeners back just so we can hear jay suggesting this’”  do beg borrow or

paid to find everything a disappointment fact so should you pay any attention to them “the trick is to tell everyone that you don’t read reviews but then read every review you can possibly find search desperately on twitter for more and take all the bad reviews to unbelievable heart and cry” says morris “the first proper review of the inbetweeners was in the guardian it said ‘you could forgive iain morris and damon beesley’s new sitcom for being puerile as it is about teenage boys what is unforgivable is that it is not funny’ eleven years later i’m still trying to forget that before the third

immediately it got put up ready for us to answer for about three days the only question was ‘why are you so shit’”  do enjoy the premiere  hurrah you have successfully written your first sitcom it should be on any minute now but be careful who you show it to “i took my mum to the premiere of the first inbetweeners film” says morris “i was so embarrassed by the content i made everyone shuffle down so i could sit at least eight seats away at the start of the film jay wanks into some sliced ham which is embarrassing enough at the afterparty i was talking to the head of film4 and my mum came over and said ‘i always wondered why we got through so much sliced ham when you were a teenager’ i was like ‘no i was drunk and hungry … ’ and she was like ‘that’s what you say now …’ it was

489,people were like animals how supermarket staff watched the coronavirus crisis unfold,it was thursday night 8pm clap for our carers the sound of applause rising in the air leila was doing her rounds of the waitrose in west london where she works as a store supervisor rounding up the stragglers an expensively dressed young woman was browsing the aisles leila asked her to make her way to the tills as the store was now closed  the woman erupted in rage “she said ‘there’s a fucking pandemic can’t you have a little patience’” leila remembers “i thought ‘i am working through this pandemic you’re just shopping in it’” shaking with anger leila fetched a security guard who escorted the woman to the tills leaving work that evening the irony of being verbally abused during the weekly celebration of key workers was not lost on her  “the public has this sanitised image of what a key worker is” leila says “they think a key worker is a consultant in a suit or a nurse in scrubs they don’t consider us key workers – they just think we’re unskilled there have been so many instances of people getting frustrated angry taking things out on us” she sounds fatigued “you just feel kind of empty about it i guess”  but supermarket workers are key workers exempt from the lockdown restrictions that have kept so many of us at home over recent months and as essential workers they were there for the initial panicbuying through to our breadbaking mania and everything in between no one is better placed to comment on how we as a nation responded to the coronavirus crisis than our supermarket workers  “oh man” remembers alex hogan of those march stockpiling days “the panicbuying was just crazy” hogan who is 22 and lives in north ayrshire works as a checkout operator at the biggest tesco in scotland in the south of glasgow “people would be pushing past each other in the aisles and they would become quite protective of their shopping as well” hogan says  facebook twitter pinterest ‘one

managers were allowed to replenish the pasta and toilet paper during those initial weeks “one of my managers told me that he didn’t even try to put the toilet paper on the shelves – he just left it on the crate” leila says “people were taking it the minute it was out there was such a swarm of people”  during this period some shoppers behaved disgracefully – particularly after the major supermarket chains brought in restrictions on how many items shoppers could purchase in an effort to curb stockpiling “around the time they brought in the restrictions i had some of the least enjoyable shifts i’ve ever done” says warren a general assistant at one of the big four supermarkets he prefers not to say which in gloucestershire like leila and hogan he got in touch after a guardian callout for supermarket workers warren had to tell one customer that he could only buy three tins of tomato soup not 20 this did not go down well and the customer demanded that warren brought over his supervisor when warren’s supervisor confirmed that yes he could only purchase three tins he demanded to speak to the store manager who said the same thing  had he behaved more respectfully warren would have told the customer that he could have circumvented the restrictions by buying tomato soup from different brands but he was so rude warren didn’t want to “that’s a weird feeling for me” says warren “because even though this isn’t a great job – it’s not well paid and you can’t afford much or any quality of life really on the minimum wage – it’s still a job i take pride in what i do i want to help people but when customers are shouting and causing a fuss you don’t want to help them”  it was not just the customers piling on the pressure during those early days “the managers were blasting out the orders” says gavin a warehouse worker and shopfloor replenisher at a big supermarket near cardiff “especially because a lot of people were off sick they hadn’t recruited enough extra staff so they were having to push a depleted workforce they’d be pressuring staff on headphones to put more items on the shelves” for some of gavin’s colleagues it was too much “they’d be coming up to me stressed out of their heads because after an eighthour shift the tensions and frustrations with customers and managers was so high”  gavin’s experience is not unique “even before coronavirus there had been a rising problem of violence and abuse to supermarket staff” says doug russell of the usdaw union which represents approximately 260000 shop workers including staff from tesco morrisons sainsbury’s coop and asda “unfortunately the covid19 crisis added to that because it required shop workers to limit the numbers of people going into stores and enforce social distancing and restriction on sales of products which can be flashpoints for abuse”  facebook twitter pinterest shoppers queueing at an asda in gateshead photograph oli scarffafp via getty images  there is evidence that supermarket staff feel stress more acutely than other frontline workers dr rachel sumner of the university of gloucestershire has been conducting research into the health and wellbeing of frontline workers during the pandemic of the 1300 people who responded to her survey about 86 were supermarket staff “these workers had higher levels of burnout and stress than both other types of frontline workers and population norms” says sumner additionally supermarket staff were less likely to think the government’s response had been timely and effective than those from the emergency services  sumner speculates that this burnout and stress is due to the fact that most supermarket staff didn’t plan to be on the frontline in any conventional sense unlike medicine nursing or police work supermarket jobs are predominantly minimumwage without the higher earnings benefits or sense of vocation enjoyed by many emergency personnel “the thing is these people never thought they would be on the frontline of a pandemic” says sumner “your police officer or nurse to a certain extent they expect to be frontline but a checkout worker or amazon delivery guy they never expected they would be getting spat on or shouted at”  but it has not all been abuse after the stockpiling abated and the restrictions were lifted the british public settled into a kind of equilibrium “when everyone was panicbuying people were a lot more abusive” says hogan “but when clap for our carers came in people stopped doing that as much” she’s noticed customers are more talkative than usual “i’ve had customers tell me they live on their own” hogan says “and they seem quite lonely and then there are parents who tell me they’re trying to home school their kids and they’re stressed out i think people miss having that human interaction they’d have from seeing their friends and going to work”  but with normal order being restored physical distancing rules are starting to be ignored by some members of the public as is the government recommendation to shop as infrequently as possible “the majority of people are still social distancing” says russell “but many aren’t and the more we get confused messages about lockdown being relaxed the more problematic it gets for workers in shops because you get more people wanting to nip in for something quickly”  facebook twitter pinterest distancing rules are starting to be ignored by some members of the public photograph paul childsreuters  all of the supermarket workers i speak to agree “how do you stop customers coming right up to you and asking you for the frozen peas” muses gavin “when they’re in the store they want to get out of there as quickly as possible they take no notice of the signage they ignore the twometre rule … there’s a melee to get in and out as fast as they can” now when customers approach him he holds out the palm of his hand like a police officer stopping traffic “my first instinct was to ask them not to come up so close” gavin says “but by the time you ask politely they’ve already ignored you all they see is a uniform not a person and all they care about is finding an item”  inevitably working in an enclosed space such as a supermarket will increase a worker’s risk of contracting covid19 recent data from the office for national statistics shows that male sales and retail workers have covid19 death rates that are twice the national average distribution of personal protective equipment ppe varies among the major supermarket chains warren has been given rubber gloves but they make it difficult to operate the selfscan tills which ends up annoying customers  one worker at an asda in south wales told me staff had been given no form of ppe whatsoever “after about four weeks some bottles of hand sanitiser appeared in the rest rooms but we’ve been given no individual hand sanitiser” he says “i get paid £9 an hour to put my life on the line” says the worker whose age he is in his 60s puts him in the higherrisk group for coronavirus “that’s not being over the top about it we are putting our lives on the line for £9 an hour”  in response asda commented “we have worked with our colleagues to provide them with extensive support throughout this period and we are proud of the work they are doing every day to serve customers although colleagues haven’t raised concerns with us … we’re doing everything possible to support them as they carry out their vital roles such as providing gloves masks and perspex screens”  of all the supermarkets waitrose appears to have been the best when it comes to offering ppe to staff “they’ve given us masks and visors gloves loads of sanitiser and we have protective screens at all the checkouts” leila concedes “i can’t fault them”  hogan’s mother is in a highrisk group for coronavirus as a result of a kidney transplant when she gets home from work hogan takes off all her clothes at the front door and showers immediately but she worries it’s not enough “my mum hasn’t been going out” hogan says “so if she was to get symptoms i know it would come from me i’m a bit anxious i have to make sure that doesn’t happen which is why i’m supercareful”  as for the wider public what better indication of how they are coping than their shopping baskets in the waitrose where leila works the predominantly middleclass customers have sought comfort in familiar pleasures “we sold out of charlie bigham’s ready meals really quickly” leila says “another hilarious thing we sold out of is manuka honey – i think because coronavirus has respiratory symptoms everyone’s buying a lot of alcohol and fancy meat” one customer kicked up a fuss because they had purchased £3000 of wine but couldn’t get a delivery slot  facebook twitter pinterest waitrose appears to have been the best when it comes to offering ppe to staff photograph guy bellrexshutterstock  but there are more subtle indicators that all is not well shoplifting is up for a start “i think because security is so busy manning the queue there are a lot more shoplifters” says leila “two weeks ago someone nearly got away with £500 worth of alcohol” in addition to the professional shoplifters who target highvalue items such as alcohol and meat and steal to order gavin has noticed more “pilfering” shoplifting cheaper minor essentials “i think it’s people who are now suffering economically who are taking things because they can’t afford to pay for them” he says “people haven’t been paid for a while and they’ve come to the supermarket and for the first time in their life perhaps they’ve been hungry and stolen something”  the pilfering the rudeness the stockpiling and more truly the supermarket worker saw it all and having a frontrow seat during this period of national crisis has been a simultaneously heartening and dispiriting experience “i’ve had people say ‘you’re doing really important work’” says warren “but as with life in general you tend to remember the bad stuff – the customer who called you a twat rather than the one who patted you on the back”  hogan hopes that the lockdown will usher in an era of greater respect for lowpaid workers “before when people would ask what i do they would be quite judgmental” she says “they’d say ‘why don’t you do something else’” not any more “people will come up to me and say ‘thank you for being on the checkout’ i’ve never had that before” she sounds surprised “i just hope it lasts”  some names have been changed
490,you have to respond forcefully can joe biden fight trumps brutal tactics,once joe biden was adamant he would wait until after the november election to give his opponent a nickname “former president donald trump”  but as the smears from the president his family and his campaign grew increasingly caustic biden responded with a moniker of his own  “i call him president tweety” biden said this week  the name was perhaps more a statement of fact than an effective rejoinder to trump’s own nickname for biden “sleepy joe” but its genesis also reflected the difficulty of running against a man whose appetite for political combat defined his rise to power  namecalling conspiracypeddling and grievanceairing were parts of the playbook trump deployed in 2016 first against 16 republicans then against hillary clinton  now six months before another election eager to distract from a pandemic that has killed nearly 100000 and ravaged the us economy trump and his allies are reprising these same brutal tactics generating a fog of insinuations accusations and smears  trump is going to throw everything and the kitchen sink and we havent seen the kitchen sink yet moe vela  “he’s going to throw everything and the kitchen sink” said moe vela a former senior adviser to biden “and we haven’t seen the kitchen sink yet”  flush with cash and digital prowess the trump campaign recently unveiled an ad offensive targeting biden on fronts including his age and past comments on china trump hammered the theme in an interview on sunday the 73yearold president accusing his 77yearold rival of lacking the mental acuity to lead an economic recovery claiming biden “doesn’t know he’s alive”  the president’s sons also got in on the act on fox news eric trump accused democrats of “milking” coronavirus lockdowns to improve their electoral prospects donald trump jr shared a meme that baselessly suggested biden was a pedophile the younger trump claimed he was “just joking” – then shared another message that made the same insinuation  all of that came as trump launched a dark and unfounded accusation that barack obama – and by extension his vicepresident – was involved in a plot to undermine his successor  “god almighty this is sick” biden told yahoo news but he dismissed the onslaught as a tired attempt to divert the public from trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak a central theme of the biden postprimary campaign so far  asked if he intended to ignore the president biden who once challenged trump to a pushup contest replied “i don’t want to get down in the mud with these guys”  and yet his campaign has acknowledged the effectiveness of trump’s tactics in a fundraising email that included a screen grab of one of the president’s campaign blasts to supporters that carried the subject line joe biden is guilty    biden’s campaign lamenting the falsehoods in the email warned ​“​it is the exact same thing he did in 2016 and quite honestly we’re scared because we know it worked last time​”​  ‘the more he talks the better off i am’  the trump camp hopes to frame the election as it did in 2016 a choice between an antiestablishment change agent and a corrupt washington insider but it is far from certain if it can deliver the same dramatic ending as the cast roles and backdrop have all changed significantly  donald trump speaks as senators john barrasso and mitch mcconnell wear masks photograph patrick semanskyap  trump is now a president with a governing record to defend and biden despite his vulnerabilities and a lengthy record of his own is far less polarizing than clinton who had been the target of decades of sensationalist attacks  the campaign looks different too it remains uncertain when if ever the candidates will be able return to the traditional trail under the pandemic rallies debates even party conventions are in doubt and though biden lacks trump’s bully pulpit he believes the new landscape has worked to his advantage  “the more he talks the better off i am” the challenger said this week  yet even by the standards of trump’s presidency his behavior has alarmed some in his party they fear he may cost them the senate and the white house but he has also rattled some democrats who warn that he now has at his disposal the arsenal of the federal government reinforced by republican allies in congress  “he used to tweet ‘lock her up’ said jesse ferguson a democratic operative who worked on clinton’s campaign “now he pressures the justice department to issue a subpoena”  after trump alleged criminal conduct by his predecessor in the oval office attorney general william barr was forced to respond dismissing the possibility of an investigation into obama or biden but barr did not count out investigations of obama aides and senate republicans vowed to look into the matter ron johnson of wisconsin forged ahead with a vote this week authorizing a subpoena to investigate business dealings involving biden’s son hunter  democrats think an anxious nation simply wants leadership in a moment of crisis  “trump tries to be the master distractor but it’s those very distractions that are one of his biggest problems right now” ferguson said “every time he goes in for a smear what people see is him avoiding responsibility for his failures”  ‘a lizard brain’  trump’s penchant for conspiracy theories poses a unique problem responding to baseless claims risks elevating them not responding can allow such claims to spread uncontrollably  already trump has elevated unsubstantiated claims about biden’s ties to china his son’s business dealings and the supposed “deep state” plot he calls “obamagate” inside the conservative media echo chamber these messages are easily amplified  one of the lessons we learned from 2016 is that just pivoting to policy is not a solution tim miller former jeb bush adviser  “trump is uniquely skilled at this” said tim miller a republican who worked on jeb bush’s 2016 campaign “he’s got a lizard brain for it”  miller said it was important to closely monitor stories on social media and fringe websites to determine what is gaining traction and thus warrants a response  part of the trick is knowing when and how to respond he said biden’s campaign should arm allies and surrogates with forceful rebuttals particularly to claims about hunter biden and the obama administration perhaps most importantly he said the campaign must be ready to go on the offensive  “one of the lessons we learned from 2016 is that just pivoting to policy is not a solution” he said  biden’s campaign has been quick to decry trump’s attacks as a sign of desperation as the president slides in national polls in response to the effort to paint biden as “china’s puppet” an ad hit trump as soft on beijing and the campaign has also escalated critiques of trump’s response to the coronavirus crisis  “we know that donald trump has utterly failed his test of leadership” biden said at a virtual wisconsin rally “he thinks he’s a builder but he’s a destroyer of everything he touches”  in turn the trump camp has indicated that little will be off limits – even charges that apply equally to the president himself when biden said on friday that african americans who don’t support him “ain’t black” the trump campaign quickly assembled a press call featuring prominent black supporters of a president whose critics regularly accuse him of racism hours later biden apologized  as one republican operative described the strategy “it’s not ‘my guy is better than your guy’ it’s ‘your guy isn’t as good as you think he is’”  ‘you can’t let any attack go unanswered’  give the current national crisis few strategists believe trump can successfully reframe the election as anything but a referendum on his record in office democrats say his scattershot messaging suggests his campaign is struggling to find a line of attack that sticks  joe biden and his wife jill biden share a zoom video call with their granddaughter finnegan biden photograph brian cahnzuma wirerexshutterstock  but even a marginal impact on support or turnout could make a difference in what will likely be another close race said ben tulchin a top pollster on both bernie sanders campaigns for the democratic nomination  “you can’t let any attack go unanswered” he said “any attack he makes you have to respond forcefully you can’t allow him to define you”  after nearly 50 years in national politics biden believes trump and his allies face an uphill battle trying to change public perception of him  “people know me” biden said this week “the good news is the bad news”  on friday evening perhaps seeking to assuage any doubts stoked by trump’s “sleepy joe” attacks the candidate outlined for donors a daily workout routine designed by a former white house doctor every exercise and repetition must add up to 46 biden said because he would be the 46th president  “i wish i’d been the 20th president” he said “it would have been a lot easier”
491,democrats are fueling a corporate counterrevolution against progressives  david sirota,these are bleak days for america’s progressive movement the democratic primary process handed the party’s nomination to the candidate with the most conservative record corporatefriendly politicians like the new york governor andrew cuomo are using the pandemic to brandish their images and install billionaires to run things progressive lawmakers in congress are being steamrolled even by their own party’s leadership and a recession is battering the state and local budgets that fund progressive priorities like education and the social safety net  joe biden pushed to embrace radicalism of fdr by scale of economic crisis read more  perhaps this is a temporary stallout – a fleeting moment of retreat in a twostepsforwardonestepback trajectory after all polls continue to show that from workers’ rights to universal healthcare a majority of americans support a progressive policy agenda  the problem though is that democrats in washington are not just passively failing to mount a strong opposition to donald trump – they are actively helping republicans try to fortify the obstacles to longterm progressive change well after this emergency subsides  this corporate counterrevolution is easiest to see in democrats’ enthusiastic support for republicans’ legislative response to the coronavirus crisis democrats’ entire 2018 electoral campaign told america that the opposition party needed to win back congress in order to block trump’s regressive agenda and yet when the republicans proposed a bill to let trump’s appointees dole out government cash to their corporate allies with no strings attached this same opposition party mustered not a single recorded vote against the package not one  thanks to that trump appointees and the federal reserve can now hand out 4tn to politically connected corporations as they lay waste to our economy and steamroll progressive reforms private equity firms and fossil fuel companies get new tax breaks as they buy elections and try to lock in permanent climate change  these bailouts were part of a larger legislative package that included good things like expanded unemployment benefits – and so you could argue that democrats simply had to swallow a bitter pill and vote yes except they subsequently proposed their own standalone legislation that would further strengthen the corporate opponents of progressive reform  for example there is the democrats’ push to alter the socalled paycheck protection program ppp those loans were designed to help employees of momandpop enterprises throughout the country house democrats’ new stimulus legislation would open up the small business lending program to what they call “small nonprofits” but their language was crafted to provide the forgivable loans to industry trade associations those lobby groups represent the planet’s biggest corporations – and their political action committees have delivered more than 191m of campaign cash to lawmakers in the last two decades  democrats have pitched their legislation as a “message” bill that declares their values – and in this case they are reassuring washington powerplayers that money meant for workers at neighborhood restaurants local shops and other momandpop concerns can be raided by the front groups representing giant drug companies health insurers and wall street firms if the legislation passes it would not merely be an epic tale of greed – the new funding stream for corporate lobbying groups would bolster the very forces that make sure federal policy disempowers workers maximizes private profit and generally protects the ruling class  the tragedy is we’re already moving in that wrong direction and chances to change the dynamic dont come around often  it’s an even worse story on healthcare as 43 million americans face the prospect of losing private health insurance democrats had a huge opportunity after trump himself suggested he wanted the government to pay healthcare providers directly for treating uninsured covid19 patients they could have called his bluff and passed existing legislation to expand a medicare program that provides actual medical care instead house democrats passed a bill to support lightly regulated private insurance marketplaces and to subsidize existing private insurance plans through a rube goldberg machine known as cobra – and they passed this giveaway just after receiving an infusion of campaign cash collected by insurance lobbyists  taken together these initiatives would route yet more public money through a corporate insurance bureaucracy in hopes that medical care eventually trickles down to americans who desperately need it such a system is totally inadequate during a pandemic it doesn’t guarantee healthcare – it only only guarantees insurance coverage which is so often denied or restricted when a medical claim is actually filed moreover corporate health insurance has far higher administrative costs than singlepayer programs like medicare and even the muchvaunted affordable care act allows insurers to siphon up to 20 of customers’ premiums to corporate profits rather than actual medical care  but then democrats’ cobra plan is not merely a financial bailout for insurers – it is also a political bailout when the industry needs it most at a time when popular support for medicare for all is surging – when even a republican president feels the need to make rhetorical if empty gestures toward the concept of governmentfunded healthcare – the cobra plan would use public money to firm up the private health insurance industry’s dominance over the healthcare system just in time to short circuit a medicare expansion  that’s probably why insurance companies have been lobbying for it they know that such a program would boost their shortterm profits and they know that once such a program is in place it would be politically difficult to get it repealed and replaced by progressives’ far better medicare for all program in other words democrats’ cobra plan may secure insurance companies’ profitskimming position between americans and their healthcare providers for decades to come  if you get the sense that the fix is in and this is all deliberate you’re not wrong many of the selfstyled progressive advocacy groups in washington that posture as resistance leaders turned a blind eye to the bill’s problems and endorsed the legislation shortly after it was introduced undercutting progressive lawmakers off the bat  making matters worse was the theater on the house floor during the debate over the democratic bill nine progressive lawmakers made a public show of voting against the procedural measure to advance the bill along with a tiny group of moderates when it came to the real vote on actually passing the bill a larger group of moderates ended up voting against it but only one progressive lawmaker representative pramila jayapal voted no had the progressives and moderates combined forces on either of the votes they would have forced the bill back to the drawing board instead their shenanigans ultimately helped secure the legislation’s passage  campaign wars trump rallies base while biden tries to broaden his read more  taken together the spectacle was more confirmation that whatever resistance exists in the nation’s capital it is so often performance art rather than anything real  “outside groups and house lawmakers need to work together to build a populist bloc – probably inclusive of moderate democrats and perhaps even an occasional republican – who will stand united to force votes to ensure that our economy does right by ordinary people” said david segal of demand progress pointing to news of a potential democratic coalition to buck the party’s leadership and support a plan to float businesses’ payrolls through the crisis “we must make sure that america does not go in the wrong direction and become even more inequitable because we let unemployment soar compel cities and states to implement austerity force small businesses to shutter and let large corporations backstopped by the fed roll them up”  the tragedy is that we’re already moving in that wrong direction and chances to change the political dynamic do not come around often as barack obama’s former chief of staff rahm emanuel now an investment banker and tv talking head said more than a decade ago during the financial crisis “never allow a good crisis to go to waste – it’s an opportunity to do the things you once thought were impossible”  billionaires and corporations are clearly following that advice aiming to use the pandemic to grow their wealth and political power in previously unfathomable ways it would be better if the opposition party put up a real fight – or at least refused to be complicit in postponing progress for yet another generation
492,new zealanders – like jacinda ardern – might not be shocked by earthquakes but we do get scared  charlotte grahammcclay,as i awoke to the bedroom shuddering and rattling around me on monday morning my first thought was a frantic household census followed by the realisation that i was alone at home and not responsible for anyone’s safety but my own my second before my eyes had even properly unstuck themselves from sleep was “ugh not this again”  moments later the earthquake – a magnitude 59 shake that hit about an hour’s drive north of wellington new zealand where i live – was subsiding it rattled the lower part of the north island for just 15 seconds or so long enough for a little tendril of fear to uncurl – would it build or die away was this “the big one”  nearby at new zealand’s parliament the prime minister jacinda ardern was live on air when the quake struck she barely paused as the camera jolted and the room shook and she cast her eyes at the ceiling  “we’re just having a bit of an earthquake here ryan” she told the show’s host her calm demeanour drew admiration around the world but many new zealanders recognised themselves in her actions  “this is kinda the nz way” a friend said on twitter adding a description of her own response as “hmmm let me look around assess if this is actually bad enough that i should take cover nah let’s give it another five seconds and see … ”  the prime minister’s was an especially cool performance she didn’t even swear which is more impressive than me but new zealanders are used to earthquakes they’re scary but not shocking children are taught in school to “drop cover and hold” – diving below a desk or table and clinging on until the shaking stops – and we were raised knowing that one day without warning the quake we call “the big one” would hit  there are about 15000 earthquakes in new zealand each year according to our geological science agency with about 100 to 150 of those large enough to be felt the country lies across tectonic plates on the edge of the pacific “ring of fire” a 40000km arc of volcanoes and ocean trenches  there are several big earthquakes – magnitude six and above – each year on average not all of them are felt everywhere in the country but many new zealanders would have experienced at least one that was truly scary you can only be so prepared and so you prepare and then try to forget about it occasionally you hear a distant rumble cock an ear and think to yourself “is that … ” before realising the sound is a plane coming in to land or an especially heavy truck  but sometimes seconds later the room starts to wobble and so you freeze as the prime minister did on monday and make a quick mental calculation is this getting stronger or weaker the dying quakes sputter out within seconds usually and you’re back to whatever you were doing in the wake of them many new zealanders log on to twitter where a dedicated hashtag eqnz has been in use for a decade there friends enemies and politicians alike share advice jokes swearing and relief – with levels of hysteria dependent on the earthquake’s magnitude – even if it’s the middle of the night  the rare shakes that build – where the rumbling becomes a roar and it lasts long enough that you have time to realise you should drop for cover dive for children or pets grab your glasses and phone and shoes wondering if the house might fall down or if you might die – those are the kind we all dread  my fear the moment that a serious shake begins doesn’t come from the unknown but from the known covering the aftermath of the christchurch earthquakes in 2010 and 2011 and remembering what that city looked like what happened to people  hours after the february 2011 quake that killed 185 people i watched a former flatmate being pulled alive from the rubble on the television news before christchurch earthquakes were common but the possibility that one could tear the ground apart under our feet seemed hypothetical now we know that’s not the case  instead our seeming insouciance like the prime minister’s in the face of shakes comes from knowing “the big one” could happen any time from thinking about it so much civil defence officials encourage households to plan what they’d do in the event of a quake and emergency kits are a common sight in homes  ﻿in new zealand earthquake preparation is a public business around my neighbourhood in wellington near the sea a “tsunami zone” is demarcated cheerfully by blue lines that let you know when you’ve climbed high enough on a hilly street to reach safety my husband and i secured our rental property immediately after a major quake in 2016 because the previous occupants – recent arrivals from britain – had been so traumatised by the experience of fleeing a tsunami risk area in the middle of the night that they no longer wanted to live there  we eyeballed the distance to the nearest raised ground – seven minutes away on foot probably quicker if we thought we might die – and signed the lease besides it was either that or a central city apartment building and who knew whether that was any safer “it’s wellington” we shrugged “you’ve got to live somewhere”  this afternoon as i worked a rumble grew in the distance and i cocked my head “is that ” i thought and then the couch began to shake i fired off a message to my boss “another ducking earthquake” i did not mean “ducking” and paused deciding whether to act was it building or dying away moments later it was over a car alarm wailed on my street new zealanders complained on twitter normal life resumed i wondered what jacinda ardern was doing

494,the office is obsolete and thats a good thing  brianne kimmel,before covid19 a recent us census estimated that 52 of us workers 8 million people worked from home i’d personally say that number likely increased by a factor of 10 based on zoom’s daily active user growth 10 million in december 2019 to over 300 million in april 2020 the world forced by disaster into an almost fully remote workforce for many sectors including the entertainment industry and services like yoga and personal training as companies like salesforce and twitter make working from home permanent many are already dreading our remote future  kevin roose of the new york times recently warned that remote work leads to isolation and removed the serendipity of the office nick martin of the new republic warned against the push of people to be “more productive” working from home – that we should not be expected to use the hours of commute time that we’re saving to do more work but live healthier lives a sentiment echoed by roose’s colleague taylor lorenz  and they’re right hustle culture is poisonous the idea we must endlessly strive for personal and professional productivity is degenerative to society but to assume it’s entirely tied to techbased work is missing a larger problem of the corporate workforce – the religious attachment to work that work should give our lives meaning  the “best” of us aren’t necessarily the hardest workers but those who excel in our careers – lauded appreciated and rewarded for our work beyond money we uproot our families to live closer to work we fear losing our job because then we can’t afford the house we need to live close to work a house that costs so much because everyone around us is trying to live close to work too we forgo time with friends and family for work happy hours where we need to be seen to know that we’re dedicated to our work and maybe even get a better position at work much is sacrificed for our work much of which is because we have to physically be there work becomes our personality who we date how we dress how we look – so much of that is tied to having to physically be there  the table stakes for any conversation around removing the office start with the average commute of an american which last year hit over 27 minutes i haven’t met many people with a commute under 45 minutes and a recent report said that commuters wait an average of 54 hours a year stalled in traffic an estimated 128 million of the 150 million working americans commute to work in a car the rest predominantly using a lackluster public transport system intelligence firm inrix showed a 30 or so drop in cars on the road in america from covid19 – with italy showing a stunning 65 drop in traffic this significant drop in transportation will likely have a part to play in the fight against global warming and we now have a rare chance to take significant numbers of cars off the road by seeing the office for what it is – a paper tiger with assumed importance and effect on productivity  the concept of face time is used to keep us in the office with managers believing remote work dilutes people’s work to numbers and documents – a sanitized and creativityfree wasteland ironically that same appearance at the office is often used to evaluate people based on whether they’re “nice” or “productive” which usually means someone looks busy or stressed out an excellent piece by michelle ruiz of vogue referred to bill gates’s creation of the obsession around face time citing a survey where employees at large american companies spent 54 of their time on email meetings administrative tasks and “interruptions” she calls face time “a mirage the symbolic appearance of working going to meetings chatting with coworkers but not actually getting much done”  the physical office reinforces the expectation that you’re white attractive from the right school that you’re dressed the right way and that you do the things that your gender or race or both are expected to do  in a world where 86 of employees believe physical appearance matters – with 73 believing it affects competency – removing physical appearance as a factor of evaluation is incredibly valuable appearance continues to be exacerbated by race with women of color continually left out of executive roles and experiencing more sexual harassment and bullying than anyone else when we’re all reduced to squares on a video chat where nobody has great angles or perfect lighting we’re all unified by how imperfect we look – it’s refreshing and a lot fairer  a world where the office is obsolete is more positive more communal and more productive it’s one that reconnects us with our neighbors nearby and grounds us in personal principles rather than professional achievements  there is a place for a physical office to exist but it should be an optional space for employees to choose based on preferred working style working from home’s stigma has always been around a perception of a person being less relevant to the bigger picture or a remote company being less significant now that we’ve got apple google and facebook going entirely remote it’s obvious that the office is somewhat of a farce – a temple of assumed importance
495,a tedious day trip to a market town that sparks a national crisis we’ve all done it  joel golby,as reviews for barnard castle go “i drove 260 miles broke a pandemicenforced nationwide lockdown that i personally helped introduce risked the health of my extended family rocked the stability of my own career and torpedoed the reputation of both myself and the actual prime minister of the united kingdom just to go there and see the silver swan automaton” takes some beating i have never wanted to see a small teesdale market town so much in my squalid little life i cannot imagine the precious selection of keychains the gift shops there must have i would risk it all for barnard castle  if you’ve somehow missed all this imagine i am gesturing weakly at dominic cummings’ house where a crowd of agitated neighbours unsocially distanced tv journalists and – obviously always – some sort of led by donkeys stunt van are all assembled in waiting then the headline news right now is a joint investigation by the guardian and the daily mirror found that dominic cummings that gollumbutifhedressedfromtheassortedbagsinthebackroomofacharityshop one from the government broke lockdown in the hardest way possible by driving from london to durham when his wife had coronavirus then – after a perfunctory whatsappcoordinated round of tory ministers tweeting their “it wasn’t that bad really” defences of the senior adviser – a further claim once in durham as coronavirus infections crested nationwide cummings zigged out on a nice little day trip to the castle then back to london then allegedly back again to durham where an eyewitness says they saw him among some woodlands calling the bluebells there “lovely” ladies and gentlemen we got him  for the record cummings denies the bluebells story for some reason though it’s this detail that really sells this story to me i can taste these day trips i can feel them in my bones there is something uniquely unquestionably british about the mediocre 30minute drive to an underwhelming landmark your muscles ache from the cramped car journey your mouth tastes milky and chalky from the cheese sandwich you ate from a lunchbox left to warm on the backseat the sun is in the sky but it’s threatening to rain in a way where you have to wear a jacket even though it’s slightly too hot for a jacket for some reason the whole endeavour is psychically exhausting and you make useless observational small talk to the people around you this is what you risked the united kingdom’s public health strategy for an underwhelming tedious british day trip  but the bigger story here is that people are furious at a conservative government in a way that years of austerity and cronyism somehow wasn’t enough to inspire the tinderbox situation of people being stuck inside on a lockdown still still while at the height of the pandemic a senior government adviser flouted the regulations we all followed to according to the prime minister on sunday resolve his childcare issues other people have childcare issues but follow the rules other people desperately want to see their parents but follow the rules it’s arguable that the cummings incident is the first to truly politicise this pandemic i know it’s always been political if you’re already feeling political but a lot of people have been more willing than usual to give boris johnson a bit of leeway because “oh come on he’s surely doing his best” because the picture painted is the clearest example yet of one rule for us one for them is dominic cummings allowed to leave his house and look at bluebells because well he’s dominic cummings and dominic cummings follows his instinct you however in your position as “not dominic cummings” don’t get to do that you just get to watch your family’s funerals from a distance  this has led predictably to cummings’ defenders being willing to jump on the sword for the infamous wildflower appreciator because he represents their politics and their politics are sacrosanct and so the law and logic go out of the window in place of defending the glorious name of the conservative party mike graham used his morning talk radio slot to ceremonially rip up dissenting newspapers a times editorial suggests cummings had been cornered by politically motivated critics matt hancock tweeted it was “entirely right for dom cummings to find childcare for his toddler” with michael gove adding “caring for your wife and child is not a crime” as though anyone else pandemiccaring for their wife and child without driving close to 300 miles to do it somehow didn’t want it enough boris johnson used an entire coronavirus briefing to talk about his adviser’s paternal instincts rightwing commentators have jumped on tame footage of cummings’ neighbours booing him in the street attacking people enacting literally the most basic level of protest as being mortally illegally insulting and rude  and we are still in lockdown so what can we do there are talks of a digital protest and an 8pm booforboris on tuesday night but there feels a dreadful inevitability to this despite calls from mps within his own party despite public outcry and huge letterwriting campaigns despite a negative if you can imagine it daily mail front page even if everyone in the country booed out of their window in a baleful howl it still feels like cummings will be more or less fine because his only friend is the most powerful man in the country with a huge parliamentary majority and no election on the horizon  • joel golby is the author of

496,without guidance banks wont help the uk recover from coronavirus  josh ryancollins,the financial sector was the cause of the last major economic downturn of 2008 this time round we need it to help aid a strong recovery following the economic shock caused by coronavirus as they did during the last crisis central banks have prevented financial sector collapse with the g7 nations injecting 25tn of new money into financial markets in march and april through quantitative easing and related liquidity programmes  in the face of demandandsupply shocks causing some industries to contract and widespread unemployment we now need banks asset managers and stock markets to take advantage of this liquidity by lending to productive and jobcreating sectors of the economy these jobs need to be sustainable so we also need patient finance – long term committed highrisk investment – to create the green infrastructure and innovation needed to rapidly transition to a zerocarbon economy  currently in the uk only about £1 in every £10 lent by british banks goes to nonfinancial firms most credit flows into existing property and supports financial trading of one kind or another similar patterns are evident in many other advanced economies as yet there is little sign of industrial strategy being linked to coronavirus finance  the good news is we can look to the postsecond world war period for a playbook on how to do it after 1945 advanced economies faced an epic recovery challenge with public debts even higher than those predicted to arise this year the uk’s debttogdp ratio reached almost 250 in 1947 finance played a key role in the recovery and “golden age” that followed but central banks did not just create new money they worked closely with governments to ensure the money was directed to the right parts of the economy  “credit guidance” policies were employed to steer bank lending into priority sectors – including exports manufacturing housing and transport infrastructure – and away from more speculative sectors stateowned development banks channelled both government and household savings into infrastructure and innovative highgrowth sectors financial rents – profits from interest speculation and capital gains – were minimised via the imposition of capital controls which restricted speculative foreign inflows and the maintenance of low rates of interest on government debt these low rates enabled aggressive government spending programmes which enabled full employment  in western economies these policies supported job growth corporate investment industrial transformation and modernisation to such an extent that the period become known as the “golden age” of capitalism by keeping nominal growth ie gdp plus inflation above the rate of interest on government debts such policies also effectively deflated away the public and private debt piles that had built up  however in the 1970s the strategy changed high inflation in advanced economies was blamed on too much government interference in the economy and spurred a shift in economic thinking a new consensus emerged that creditguidance policies distorted the efficient allocation of capital by market forces the term “financial repression” invented by stanford economists edward shaw and ronald mckinnon was used to disparage the policy by the 1980s financial repression policies were abandoned and prohibited as part of the liberalisation and deregulation of finance  today in response to the economic crash caused by the pandemic some central banks are again embracing aspects of financial repression offering ultralow interest rates and financing government debt but so far directing credit to support industrial policy objectives appears to be a step too far  instead central banks have focused on propping up new areas of the financial system that were previously outside their regulatory purview in particular capital markets the federal reserve has created programmes to purchase corporate assets in sectors that arguably make little contribution to sustainable economic growth these include various speculative asset markets such as private equity and exchangetraded funds which invest in risky corporate sector markets to feed investors’ thirst for highyielding assets such activity props up stock markets but doesn’t guarantee any investment in the real economy  the pandemic has exposed the failings of britains centralised state  john harris read more  meanwhile some central banks and governments are supporting key sectors that require structural change to transition to a zerocarbon economy such as aviation oil and mining with few conditionalities attached a large state investment bank could take equity stakes in such firms and support them to transition their business models while saving jobs but the uk doesn’t have one and there is little public discussion about creating one this is despite britain losing access to the sizeable spending of the european investment bank due to brexit  the bottom line central banks need to return to the creditallocation and investmentled growth policies that reignited the economy after the second world war the classic central bank defence of maintaining “market neutrality” or independence is looking increasingly weak when as in the us 38 million people have filed for unemployment yet stock markets enjoy record rallies you know something has fundamentally gone wrong rather than financial repression we have financial dominance  financial repression needs a rebrand let’s call it financial guidance without it advanced economies will face another anaemic recovery with it governments and central banks can get their countries back to economic health  • josh ryancollins is head of finance and

498,the spin  stanley jackson a batting master mp and sportsman who bewitched cardus,this year marks the centenary of the debut in this newspaper’s sports pages of neville cardus perhaps the greatest of all cricket writers there has probably been enough written about the great man – may i refer you to duncan hamilton’s the great romantic the winner of the 2019 william hill sports book of the year award – but reading his early articles throws up so many more fascinating questions than those simply about their author  one obvious question was prompted by the first article published under his chosen byline “cricketer” a summary of lancashire’s prospects in the 1920 season  the players had returned to training the previous day “the weather was of a sort to humble the flesh to stir up the rheumatics and the exposed nerves in the teeth” cardus wrote “it was in fact a good day for another cuptie a spirit of intense keenness was in the air which augurs well for the strenuous work to be done that summer” though of course there were few conclusions to be drawn from a session in the nets  “the practice yesterday did not invite serious criticism” he wrote “the main job on hand was less the cultivation of style then the unloosening of the muscles after winter’s catalepsy still a good cricketer is a good cricketer even at the first knock for the year as far as technique goes his mistakes will be due to stiffness and a slow eye not to faulty style the born cricketer indeed can go for years without touching a bat and yet reveal the hand of the master as soon as he picks one up again who does not remember that great innings of fs jackson the first time he played the game after two or three years in south africa”  harsha bhogle on lockdown the ipl and the future of cricket read more  to which the answer certainly 100 years on is absolutely no one even in 1920 many readers must have scratched their heads my search for further information suggested that if you happened to miss the next day’s papers you might never have known about it  stanley jackson is known for a great many things – including playing the most home tests without appearing away 20 winning every toss as england’s captain in the 1905 ashes series he also topped the averages for batting and bowling and the over bowled for yorkshire against the australians in 1902 in which four wickets fell and he finished with figures of five for 12 george hirst took the other five wickets for nine runs the ball was cut in half and shared between them  he spent 11 years as a conservative mp and five as governor of bengal and fought in the boer war and in the first world war as the commander of a battalion of the west yorkshire regiment born in yorkshire he was educated at harrow where the practice of fagging – which forced younger boys to act personal servants of the oldest – was still very much in favour jackson’s fag was winston churchill  jackson also survived an unlikely number of neardeath scrapes including an attempted assassination by sword his evasive manoeuvre he said was “the quickest duck i ever made” an attempted assassination by gunfire she missed a direct hit on his house during the blitz “the floor at the far end of the room seemed to rise and come straight at us” and being run over by a taxi “i don’t think there is really much the matter but it gave me a bit of a jolt at my age”  he was also known for his sportsmanship once pulling off his gloves after being dismissed to applaud a particularly fine catch “what we have to do” he said of cricketers during the bodyline series “is to be quite certain in playing the game that we do not do anything on the field which can be regarded as approaching even the borderline of the undesirable”  so there was no lack of material for his obituarists when he died in 1947 at the age of 76 and there was absolutely no mention of the innings cardus found so memorable even at the time it hardly made much of an impact “jackson brightened the proceedings by a remarkable display of batting … he allowed few opportunities of scoring to escape him strong driving being the main feature of his cricket” was the sum of the guardian’s reporting of it  there was certainly nothing else worth remembering about the game it came in a threeday match between essex and yorkshire at leyton the first two days were rained off making a draw a nearcertainty when play started essex were bowled out for 89 and yorkshire’s reply started badly when john tunnicliffe was dismissed for a duck at this point out came jackson  jackson had last played for his county in 1899 before he first travelled to south africa to fight in the second boer war he played one match on an injuryenforced trip home in 1900 for gentlemen against players at the scarborough festival when in his first innings he scored 134 “some little pressure had to be brought to induce him to play at all but yesterday at all events there were few remaining traces of weakness or illhealth about him” wrote the guardian “indeed he has seldom been seen to play better” then he returned to the front not to be seen until may 1902  the spin sign up and get our weekly cricket email  “and now having once more appeared in first class cricket he begins in wonderful style by putting together another threefigure score” wrote sporting life “this is indeed a fine record and it says much for his great natural abilities as a cricketer that he should be able to jump at once into form in a dull and otherwise uninteresting afternoon’s cricket on saturday jackson’s batting was the one bright spot at the outset he was obviously ill at ease and on the slow wicket failed to time the ball properly but once he had mastered the peculiarities of the pitch he batted delightfully his defence being as strong and safe as his driving was powerful”  at stumps he had scored an unbeaten 101 which proved he was precisely as good at returning to firstclass cricket as he was at departing from it – nearly three years earlier his last innings for yorkshire had ended on precisely the same score  • this is an extract from the guardian’s weekly cricket email the spin to

499,mitchell starc raises fears of boring cricket during spitpolishing ban,the australia paceman mitchell starc has raised concerns that the recommendation of a temporary ban on using saliva to shine the ball could hand batsmen too much of an advantage  the coronavirus pandemic means spitpolishing to produce movement through the air has been deemed too great a risk by the international cricket council but the use of sweat will be allowed  harsha bhogle on lockdown the ipl and the future of cricket read more  starc suggested bowlers could require some assistance to get the ball swinging and ensure equal competition “that contest between bat and ball we don’t want to lose that or get further away from that even contest so there needs to be something in place to keep that ball swinging  “they mentioned the other day that it’s only going to be there for a period of time and then once the world gets back to a relatively normal situation then saliva can come back into shining the ball”  nowhere in the world is more associated with the swinging ball than england and nobody in the history of the game has used it as effectively and prolifically as jimmy anderson it could be fascinating to see how the bowlers manage should the test series against west indies and pakistan go ahead later this summer  the australian manufacturer kookaburra has developed a wax applicator that would allow cricket balls to be shined without using sweat or saliva and believes it could be ready to use within a month  the spin sign up and get our weekly cricket email  the laws of cricket explicitly state that fielders must not use “artificial substances” to alter the condition of the ball but the idea that umpires would oversee the process or even use the sponge applicator on behalf of the bowling team provides a possible solution  starc suggested cricket authorities may also need to issue guidance on pitch maintenance to ensure bowlers had a fair chance of taking a wicket he said “if there’s going to be a window of time whether they instruct people to leave more grass on the wickets to have more contests  “if they’re going to take away a portion of maintaining the ball there needs to be that even contest between bat and ball otherwise people are going to stop watching and kids aren’t going to want to be bowlers there are some pretty flat wickets and if that ball is going straight it’s a pretty boring contest”

501,rainbow splash to electric green the best and worst kits in mls history,w  hat makes a good soccer kit for some bold and brash is best for others clean and simple works some fans remember their favourite kits not on the basis of their design but on what their team achieved wearing them and yet there are some kits that rise to the surface as eradefining or iconic  major league soccer might not have the long and storied history of other competitions but it has had more than its fair share of memorable kits in 25 years of existence some weird some wonderful some revered some despised the line between good and bad can be blurred sometimes but there are 10 of the best kits in mls history and one of the worst  1 dc united 1996 primary  raul diaz arce of dc united right shows off the best kit in mls history photograph doug pensingergetty images  quite simply the greatest mls kit of alltime designed by the same man who’d come up with the michael jordan “jumpman” concept for nike this dc united kit for their inaugural season back in 1996 is the most classic of classic mls kits from the threestripe design across the chest and thighs to the stern eagle crest this was quintessential mls 10 and established a template which still informs dc united kit designs to this day and that’s before we even get to the way this kit was unveiled  2 kansas city wizards 1997 primary  experimentation is now frowned upon in the age of monochrome mls kits but the league was once an arena of new ideas in its early years and nothing epitomised this better than the kansas city wizards’ primary kit for the 1997 season the waves of colour across the chest became one of the most recognisable kit features in mls history while the mesh material meant fans became familiar with the nipples of their favourite players whether they wanted to or not  3 la galaxy 2012 primary  david beckham poses his sons after winning mls cup in 2012 photograph pa wirepa  for years the sash had been synonymous with the la galaxy but that was before they ditched the green and gold look in time for the arrival of david beckham in 2007 the galaxy brought it back for the 2012 season and incorporated it into their more modern blue and white colour as they won their second successive mls cup beckham said goodbye to the league in style both in the silverware he held aloft and in the kit he wore  4 chicago fire 1998 primary  some kits meet at the crosssection of classic design and historic achievement and that is certainly the case with this chicago fire effort led by bob bradley the fire won mls cup in their expansion season a feat that has never again been matched in the league’s history and they did so wearing a kit that would establish the club’s trademark look until this year’s catastrophic rebrand  5 los angeles fc 2018 primary  los angeles fc’s black and gold kit helped make a splash in their first season photograph shaun clarkgetty images  some were underwhelmed when los angeles fc unveiled their black and gold kit for their expansion season in 2018 but it has become much loved the youtubetv sponsor’s logo could have done with being gold to match the otherwise consistent look of the shorts but carlos vela and co looked menacing in it the only person at lafc who looked better was bob bradley the tracksuits and quilted jackets of swansea city are long gone daddy california now patrols the touchline at banc of california stadium  6 houston dynamo 2018 secondary  houston dynamo’s 2018 alternate kit from the city’s baseball team photograph jonathan danielgetty images  there’s just something about soccer kits that in some way offer a throwback to the past and this houston dynamo secondary kit for the 2018 season did that better than most taking inspiration from the city’s astros of the 1970s the dynamo used this kit for two mls campaigns although it was better with the graded stripes of the banner midsection were shown off without a sponsor’s logo being plastered across it even if that sponsor was for a cancer hospital empathy only counts for so much when it comes to kit design  7 philadelphia union 2013 third  this alternate kit designed for the philadelphia union’s 2013 mls season was a retro throwback to the days of bethlehem steel fc the pennsylvania team that found success in the early 1900s their historic crest was incorporated into the design of the shirt with the years they were active 19111930 etched on the neck even without these features though this kit would have become a classic despite its clear nod to the past it still managed to remain distinctly modern the union should lean into this look more often  8 new england revolution 1996 primary  believe it or not there was once a time when not every mls kit was made by adidas indeed clubs were free to strike their own kit deals for the league’s inaugural season and reebok came up with a classic for the new england revolution this kit was so 1990s it basically screamed nirvana lyrics at you if you picture this shirt on anyone other than alexi lalas ginger beard flowing in the wind you’re doing it wrong the revs attempted to evoke its spirit with their primary kit for this season  9 la galaxy 2011 third  this shirt was so popular that another los angeles team came along and copied it ok so this 2011 la galaxy secondary kit was technically punjab extremely dark blue and gold not black and gold as lafc would make their own a few years later but this was still a precursor to a leaguewide trend that would see half the teams in the division kitted out in dark colours  10 minnesota united 2020 primary  adidas adopted a leaguewide approach for the 2020 season marking mls’s 25th anniversary with a series of retro designs minnesota united’s primary kit made best use of this template the blue shoulder stripes give this shirt an unmistakably 1990s feel with the loon wing silhouette pattern adding another layer of detail minnesota united also boast the rarest of things when it comes to kit design  a sponsor’s logo that adds something a target quite literally  and the worst…  seattle sounders 2010 third  the seattle sounders in 2010 electric photograph otto greule jrgetty images  a lot of fans would include one of last year’s allwhite efforts when mls was struck by a leaguewide pandemic of blandness but the seattle sounders’ 2010 ‘electricity’ third kit takes the unwanted accolade as the worst kit in mls history were adidas going for an insideout look with this kit was this designed to double up as construction site apparel whatever the intention at the time this kit has aged worse than macklemore

503,raymond goethals marseilles messiah who toppled mighty milan  paul doyle,man who took marseille to the champions league is seldom remembered outside france and belgium but his tactical wizardry and brushes with crime make him a fascinating figure  the first final after the rebranding of europe’s premiere club competition as the champions league took place 27 years ago this tuesday it was a stinker marseille who beat milan 10 in munich had contested an even grimmer final two years previously losing the european cup on penalties to red star belgrade two lustreless showpieces are part of the reason why marseille’s then manager raymond goethals is seldom recalled as a great outside france and his native belgium despite an extraordinary career spanning nearly four decades  facebook twitter pinterest raymond goethals with his trademark cigarette in the marseille dugout photograph william stevensgammaraphogetty images  but there are other reasons he was a canny coach and an entertaining character who nearly always had a cigarette in his mouth with his distinctive hair visibly dyed black  while wearing most match days a billowing anorak that superstition forbade him from washing goethals tended to be overshadowed during his time at olympique marseille however by the club’s outrageous owner bernard tapie who had bought om in the same week in 1986 that silvio berlusconi took over milan for years european football was a battleground between two colossal egos seeking a form of validation that they could not get through their business and political conquests for tapie who also fancied himself as an actor turning marseille into european champions was “like taking jack nicholson’s role in one flew over the cuckoo’s nest”  facebook twitter pinterest raymond goethals and bernard tapie in combat photograph boris horvatafpgetty images  even more significant for goethals’ legacy however is the fact that two of his greatest triumphs – with marseille in 1993 and his belgian title with standard liège in 1982 – were soiled by corruption he was not implicated in marseille’s cheating tapie and others were sentenced to prison for bribing players from valenciennes to go easy in their last domestic match before facing milan but that scandal bore uncomfortable similarities to standard’s practice in 1982 when goethals was found to have helped bribe players from his team’s last domestic challengers waterschei before facing barcelona in the cup winners’ cup final barça ultimately beat standard 21 goethals had to resign from standard and was banned from working in belgium for a year he always denied any wrongdoing and devoted just one short paragraph of his 1994 autobiography to the affair dismissing it as “political score settling”  there was more than a whiff of the wild west about belgian football back then standard’s nearest pursuers in 1982 were anderlecht whom goethals had previously managed successfully and whose president constant vanden stock would later bribe a referee to help them beat nottingham forest in the 1984 uefa cup semifinals  for all the murk goethals was clearly an excellent coach he had shown that ever since the end of his soso goalkeeping career after which he took a trio of small clubs from obscurity to prominence before in 1966 being appointed assistant manager of belgium under vanden stock two years later vanden stock left to move into club administration and goethals took the top job he immediately ended belgium’s 16year absence from the global stage by guiding them to the 1970 world cup then led to third place in the 1972 european championship  one of goethals’ many nicknames was “raymondlascience” thanks to his ability to devise tactics to thwart the most gifted opponents usually the plan involved a high defensive line meticulous use of the offside trap and clever pressing ploys he repeated throughout his career including against milan  facebook twitter pinterest raymond goethals wearing his unwashed anorak photograph mychele daniauafpgetty images  one of his most satisfying feats came at a time when connoisseurs were starting to swoon over the netherlands’ “total football” revolution johan cruyff’s team failed to score home or away against belgium in the qualifiers for the 1974 world cup and would not have made it to the tournament if a perfectly good lastminute goal by belgium in amsterdam had not been wrongly ruled out for offside the netherlands squeaked through to the finals on goal difference as goethals’ team became the first to fail to qualify for the tournament despite not conceding a single goal  yet goethals’ teams could attack after moving back into the club game he guided anderlecht to a 40 victory in the 1978 cup winners’ cup final and two impressive super cup

the oubliette for long racing jet in his hometown of brussels hired him in 1985 before he left for bordeaux where goethals often made life difficult for tapie’s marseille on the pitch and mocked them in the press so a blissful union was not necessarily on the cards when tapie asked him to replace franz beckenbauer as marseille manager midway through the 199091 season  but they prospered together even if sparks flew constantly over the next three years goethals won three french titles though the were subsequently stripped of the 1993 one reached two european finals and was twice ousted as manager without actually being sacked instead being moved upstairs for a few months before returning to the dugout when his replacements tomislav ivic and jean fernandez fell short of tapie’s expectations  “i was never sacked in a career lasting nearly 40 years” goethals once recalled when asked about his relationship with the tempestuous tapie “but i was shown the door several times a week at marseille”  daniele massaro ‘the marseille defeat filled us with grief but we came back’ read more  goethals was nearly 70 when he stepped into the marseille cauldron and he was not afraid of tapie whom he knew needed him with few exceptions notably eric cantona the players affectionately called him papy grandad and liked him for his tactical cunning his humour and the fact that he gave them plenty of freedom outside match days an important valve that relieved the incomparable pressure of playing for marseille and tapie  marseille were first drawn against berlusconi’s milan in the quarterfinals of the 1991 european cup goethals said tapie rang him near 3am every morning for the next three months to ask “are you planning the match” to which goethals invariably replied “i’m trying to” before hanging up when the first leg at san siro finally came around what goethals and his team did was remarkable  milan were europe’s kings continental champions two years on the trot marseille pitched up in italy with only 14 players instead of the permitted 16 as goethals omitted cantona and jean tigana having fallen out with both “cantona simply did not fit into my team” he later said years after being vindicated by the consistently thrilling attacking trident of chris waddle jeanpierre papin and abedi pele  the game at san siro heralded om’s arrival as a european force marseille conceded a sloppy early goal but recovered to control the match in a way visitors never did against arrigo sacchi’s lords milan escaped with a 11 draw marseille won the home leg 10 thanks to a volley by waddle when the floodlights failed temporarily one minute from the end milan refused to play on a desperate stance that earned them a ban marseille had not merely dethroned them they had rendered them ridiculous tapie was in raptures  facebook twitter pinterest raymond goethals lifts the trophy after guiding marseille to champions league glory photograph christian liewig  corbiscorbisgetty images  but marseille grew too sure of themselves after that and failed to finish the job in the final where red star frustrated them before prevailing in a shootout goethals later lamented that his team had been too dominant and should have relented a little to coax red star forward  two years later goethals’ men finally atoned and became the first and so far only french club to conquer europe  the fiver sign up and get our daily football email  the side of 1993 was less spectacular with waddle sold to sheffield wednesday and papin to milan but they were more wily even if they let slip a 20 lead to draw with rangers at ibrox in the tournament’s group phase marcel desailly ensured the imperious carlos mozer was barely missed while fabien barthez was a big improvement on pascal olmeta in goal and didier deschamps and frank sauzée improved midfield and pele nurtured much more by goethals than he had been by beckenbauer remained a delight  the ghanaian was the best player in the 1993 final running paolo maldini ragged and taking the corner that led to the winning goal by basile boli at the age of 72 the manager frequently called “columbo” by the belgian press because of his style had solved his biggest case soon though his success was linked with crime again as word of the matchfixing against valenciennes broke
504,rafael nadal the beacon of sports old power despite new normal,one of the most refreshing aspects of sporting lockdown in the absence of watching athletes do things has been watching athletes talking properly talking i mean most of the time what normally passes for athletes talking is actually just athletes making noises contrived and arbitrated noises synthetic to the point of

very much “i don’t believe in the new normal” nadal said in a video interview with el país this month “i like the old normal with adaptations”  it’s a nice thought this idea that when tennis emerges from its summer hibernation the hierarchy of the jungle will soon reassert itself just as it always has besides nadal is one of those players who seems to have been “on the way out” for a decade or more a career in perpetual autumn  there is a famous new york times profile that describes his explosive injuryprone style as a “poetic selfimmolation the glorious athlete pushing himself resolutely towards his own undoing” that was in 2009 nadal has spent a good part of his adult life reading his own premature obituaries  if federer marks time and djokovic chases it down then nadal stretches it

winds up that immense forehand that broad torso recoiling a moment of perfect stillness that also carries an implication of irresistible power  for all this it is nadal who has also changed the most

yet perhaps a little time away from the daily grind of the tour will work to nadal’s advantage time for niggles to clear up for aches to heal for the mind to refresh and for the body to recharge and then as if awaking from a deep sleep he will return the old fire in his belly a new trick or two up his sleeve ready to suffer and conquer all over again not a new normal but an old normal with

507,ban on bushmeat after covid19 but what if alternative is factory farming,governments and who face pressure to ban commercial trade in wild animals but experts say this would criminalise a way of life for millions of people  antelope is best monkey is chewy bats needs a sauce forest porcupine is mild and pangolin – one of the most trafficked animals in the world – tastes great roasted but smells awful that at least was what the gabonese workers told us  we were in a belgianowned logging camp in gabon the day had been spent watching giant trees being felled for the chinese market but by evening everyone’s thoughts had turned to food  most rural africans and asians say “bush” or wild meat is healthier tastier and often cheaper than the bland meat of most farmed animals like chickens or pigs the joke among the african loggers in the camp that night was that asians would eat anything alive in the forest but the squeamish europeans would eat nothing  ‘mixed with prejudice’ calls for ban on ‘wet’ markets misguided experts argue read more  today as a result of covid19 and its suspected origins in a chinese “wet” market governments and the world health organization are coming under growing pressure from conservationists vegans and animal protection zoo and welfare groups to not just stop the hunting of all wild animals for food but to end the commercial trade in live animals with a global ban now is the time to link human health with biodiversity loss and animal suffering and to close all markets selling live or dead wild animals they say  qa what is a wet market show hide at the crack of dawn every day “wet markets” in china and across asia come to life with stall owners touting their wares such as fresh meat fish fruit and vegetables herbs and spices in an openair setting the sights and sounds of the wet market form part of the rich tapestry of community life where local people buy affordable food or just go for a stroll and meet their neighbours for a chat while supermarkets selling chilled or frozen meats are increasingly popular in asia older shoppers generally prefer buying freshly slaughtered meat for daily consumption believing it produces flavour in dishes and soup that is superior to frozen meat “wet markets” where water is sloshed on produce to keep it cool and fresh may be considered unsanitary by western standards but most do not trade in exotic or wild animals and should not be confused with “wildlife markets” – now the focus of vociferous calls for global bans the wuhan south china seafood market suspected to be a primary source for spreading covid19 in late 2019 had a wild animal section where live and slaughtered species were for sale including snakes beavers badgers civet cats foxes peacocks and porcupines among other animals verna yu  a spokeswoman for wwf uk says “we have called for the closure of illegal and unregulated wildlife markets primarily in urban areas what we are concerned about is the illegal consumption of highly threatened wildlife often seen as a delicacy”  there is no doubt that wild meat hunting and consumption is heavily impacting the world’s wildlife giving rise to what is called “the empty forest” where few large mammals remain a 2016 royal society paper shows that the bushmeat trade is growing fast with devastating results “as wildlife populations outside protected areas decline poaching pressure is increasing in many parks and reserves” say the authors “as a consequence many forests savannahs grasslands and deserts in the developing world are now becoming ‘empty landscapes’ devoid of harvestsensitive wild mammals”  what has changed over 50 years say scientists is the scale of the commercial wild meat trade in the past local subsistence hunters killed animals in small numbers today a highvolume industry supplies fastexpanding asian and african cities no longer run by local hunters it is helped by modern firearms and cellphones and utilises a vast network of new roads driven deep into forest concessions by the international logging industry hunters can strip a forest or wetland in a few nights and access home and export markets for their meat and as the forests are emptied of their animals the price of wild meat soars and it becomes a luxury commodity for urban elites  facebook twitter pinterest dead pangolins seized by authorities in belawan north sumatra more than 5500 species of birds mammals amphibians and reptiles are bought and sold on the worldwide animal market photograph gatha gintingafp via getty images  sue lieberman vicepresident of international policy at the new yorkbased wildlife conservation society says that growing populations in africa and asia must switch to eating farmed animals “people do need other sources of food than bushmeat i am not saying that people should not eat wild animals but there is not enough to go round any more commercialisation is the problem the first priority must be to stop the commercial markets they can’t go on practices that originated hundreds of years ago have to stop the amount it would cost to provide chicken and farmed fish to everyone in africa is negligible compared to what this pandemic is costing”  but critics of a ban say that the legal wildlife meat trade employs hundreds of thousands of people provides protein for between 30 million and 70 million people in africa alone and kills few threatened or rare animals  what about the environmental impacts of farming according to a major 2011 study led by robert nasi director general of the center for international forestry research cifor a switch to cattle to provide protein in place of wild animals would have huge impact  hunters says nasi take about 45m tonnes of bushmeat a year from forests in the congo basin and possibly 1299m tonnes in the amazon “we would need to transform large areas of tropical forests or savannas into pasture to replace this amount of bushmeat by cattle for comparison brazilian beef production is considered responsible for about 50m hectares 124m acres – twice the size of the uk of deforestation if bushmeat consumption in the congo basin was to be replaced by locally produced beef an area as large as 25 m hectares might have to be converted to pastures”  factory farming has devastating effects on wildlife says philip lymbery director of ukbased compassion in world farming “it is a main driver of wildlife decline and the destruction of the world’s remaining wild lands” he says “it’s about keeping animals caged in sheds which sounds efficient but you have to devote vast areas of land to grow their feed it drives encroachment into wild lands and the destruction of habitats  “it would cause unimaginable suffering to the animals and even more environmental devastation it would also create the perfect breeding ground for the next pandemic factory farming and pandemics are strongly linked the main driver of future pandemics will be factory farming”  facebook twitter pinterest bushmeat on sale at the weekly market in yangambi drc the animals that are hunted include warthogs monkeys and gambia rats forests in the area still have plenty of animals although numbers have declined over the past decade photograph axel fassiocifor  many epidemiologists ecologists human rights and indigenous peoples’ groups say a kneejerk global reaction to ban the wild meat trade could be unscientific counterproductive and culturally offensive  the western conservation “industry” wants an end to the eating of wild animals because it wants vast new areas of land to be “protected” in the name of increasing biodiversity says fiore longo advocacy officer of survival international  “but this model of ‘fortress conservation’ is dangerous” she says “conservationists have seized the crisis as a chance to criminalise the ways of life of a large part of the world’s population it reinforces the false divide between people and wildlife and potentially vastly increases the size of protected areas whatever the human cost may be  “what happens if we outlaw the trade and consumption of wildlife where there are no other sources of protein available do we let more people starve is a dependence on industrial food production with all its enormous environmental health and financial impacts somehow ‘better’ than the sustainable consumption of wild animals”  facebook twitter pinterest in guyana bushmeat is sold freely in a variety of places including restaurants bars private homes or on the roadside people hunt and trade wild meat for food income or just as a hobby the most commonly traded species include capybara and iguana  photograph manuel lopezcifor  “it is important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater” says john fa coordinator of the bushmeat research initiative at cifor “wild meat plays an important role in the nutrition of large populations of humans accounting for up to 50 of the protein intake of people in central africa you can’t just say to people ‘you can’t do it any more’”  wildlife hunting bans mostly fail says stephanie brittain who spent eight years in cameroon researching bushmeat consumption and now works with oxford university’s interdisciplinary centre for conservation research after the 2013–16 ebola outbreak in west africa she says bans were brought in by several countries but could not be policed the result was a marked increase in hunting for wild meat “there is no conclusive evidence that banning the wildlife trade will prevent the emergence of zoonotic diseases in the future” she says “the legal trade for species that can be safely harvested can facilitate improved hygiene and animal welfare while complete bans can drive trade underground resulting in illegal markets with lower hygiene regulation and increased risk of disease transmission”  as for the idea that disease is more likely to accompany wild meat experts point out that illnesses like mers and sars bse swine and bird flu e coli mrsa and salmonella originated in intensive poultry pig and livestock farms where the overuse of antibiotics and unhygienic conditions can spread disease quickly many are common according to the oie the world organisation for animal health there are currently more than 25 outbreaks of h5 and h7 avian flu having to be controlled in more than 20 countries including the us germany india and saudi arabia any one if unattended by vets could develop into an epidemic  “intensive farming is an area that must also be looked at” says eric fevre chair of veterinary infectious diseases at liverpool university “as we select for better milk cows better beef cows or better egglaying chickens we create populations of animals that often live in intensive conditions but where the genetics are very similar this creates risks for the emergence of diseases because if these genetically uniform large populations are susceptible things can spread very quickly”  facebook twitter

delia grace programme leader for food safety and zoonoses at the international livestock research institute said “wet markets are basically fresh food markets in the uk we like farmers’ markets with fresh cornfed chickens farmsourced meats and nice looking sausages that’s basically a wet market though in a different cultural context they are essential to bring fresh food to urban populations and provide for the food security of millions of people  “they do need to be regulated and controlled they should not be blanket banned as that is not sensitive to the needs of their clients who depend on them”  conservationists are struggling to diminish consumption of wild animals through behaviour campaigns legislation and law enforcement – especially in urban africa says congo analyst theodore trefon a researcher at the belgian royal museum for central africa  “many consumers there believe that eating bushmeat is quite simply normal respectful of tradition healthy desirable and commonsensical” he says “this is a wellknown challenge to wildlife conservationists but one that is relatively new to public health experts confronted by known and yettocome zoonotic diseases”

demographic changes coupled with rapid urbanisation more than half of ghana’s population now live in cities and global migration is changing the way families care for older people  traditionally elderly relatives stayed at home to help raise grandchildren and as they aged they were in turn cared for by those younger family members  but ghana now a middleincome country has an expanding middle class an increase in women’s education means family sizes have shrunk substantially the total fertility rate in ghana has almost halved from 64 children per woman in 1988 to 39 children per woman 33

they are alone and lonely the state assumes the family will take care of people but families have changed family structures have changed” says ansah    chronic loneliness can precipitate depression and “once depression sets in so many other things follow” says dr akye essuman director of ghana’s first geriatric medicine fellowship “people with hypertension can get out of control if they have diabetes that can also get out of control”    private care homes are slowly but steadily being introduced in the hope of revolutionising how this conservative society on the cusp of tradition and

little because if i go home there is nobody there i am always lonely”  “for the first year because it wasn’t known in ghana nobody was coming” says asomani it was only after the care home switched their adverts from a local language radio station to an english language station popular with educated professionals that the business started to look up    today there are seven residents aged between 70 and 89 the home can accommodate up to 10 people says mensah fees are on average around 250 £202 a month depending on the type of care residents need apart from hypertension some of the residents have alzheimer’s or parkinson’s disease or are recovering from strokes  the home has a structured daily routine with nurses on hand to help with medication hospital visits and other assisted living services such as grooming family visits usually happen at the weekend and there are occasional excursions    “we had one client who had been alone in the house for a long time and in the end

nothing but in the care home she is going to get all those services and the management will be better than when she is on her own in the family home” he said    however the main challenge is confronting societal perceptions about care homes “they are culturally perceived as a foreign or western concept which is alien to the ghanaian culture” says dr delali adjoa dovie of the centre for ageing studies at the university of ghana  one thing nearly all of the residents have in common is that they have previously lived or their children currently live in the west    initially ocansey’s five younger siblings were not happy about their mother’s move to the home “they had no knowledge of how the care system worked so they thought that i was going to dump her somewhere and forget about her” he says  but after visiting the home there was a change of mind and some siblings have begun contributing to the monthly costs  facebook twitter pinterest lois anim yirenkyi a health worker at

alternative care structures such as daycare centres and home care services so that older adults can stay in their own homes to receive care for as long as possible  “we need to look at what is

518,jimmy cobb drummer on miles daviss kind of blue dies aged 91,jazz musician who was key to davis’s sound was the last surviving player on the classic album  jimmy cobb the jazz drummer and last surviving player on miles davis’s seminal 1959 album kind of blue has died from lung cancer at age 91  cobb was key in helping to achieve the cool disposition of a handful of davis’s masterworks including 1959’s porgy and bess 1960’s sketches of spain 1961’s someday my prince will come the 1962 live set miles davis at carnegie hall and live at the black hawk sessions  but it was his cymbal work and light pulse on kind of blue the album that cemented davis’s reputation as the coolest of jazz cats and cited as the bestselling jazz record ever released for which he will be best remembered  “miles would tell us all little things to do and then have us work off his idea” cobb told billboard in 2019  “he trusted all of us because he knew we were all good musicians he didn’t really have to do anything else but say what he wanted done”  facebook twitter pinterest miles davis on stage with cobb and the bass player paul chambers at the apollo theater in 1960 photograph herb snitzergetty images  cobb born in washington dc in 1929 began his touring career with the saxophonist earl bostic later joining the vocalist dinah washington pianist wynton kelly and saxophonist cannonball adderley  according to his website he also played with billie holiday pearl bailey and dizzy gillespie before joining davis in 1957  explaining the exquisite sensitivity of his drumming he once explained that playing with some of jazz’s most renowned vocalists had helped him to develop his style  “i guess the sensitivity probably comes from having to work with singers because you have to really be sensitive there” he said in an oral history for the smithsonian “you have to listen and just be a part of what’s going on”  cobb died surrounded by family at his home his wife eleana cobb told the new york daily news  “he was a very special and unusual person – a gifted musician with natural talent like an athlete and a gifted human being with a great happy personality” eleana said  “he played all around the world he was vibrant up until the end” she said “it’s a big deal that he’s gone it’s very painful i’m a little bit in shock”
519,id love to see their parents bank accounts corona and comedys class divide,from care work to shelfstacking many standups have taken up jobs to survive lockdown – highlighting how privilege has created a twotier system in comedy  on 16 march when boris johnson advised people to avoid pubs and theatres the effect on live comedy was instant “that night was like take me out when all the lights go off but with my diary” says standup lauren pattison “the first month of work went in the space of a couple of days”  in 2017 pattison finally became a fulltime comedian after years of working in restaurants shops and bars to support her standup career soon after she was nominated for best newcomer at the edinburgh comedy awards now she’s working in a supermarket pattison had moved back to newcastle upon tyne a few weeks before lockdown to save money for the edinburgh fringe while living with her parents like many standups she relies on live comedy for the bulk of her income gigging most nights of the week some gigs are rescheduled for later this year but says pattison “i’ve got to mentally and financially prepare for the fact they might get pulled”  people assume i’m gutted that i’ve had to get a job but to me it’s the most sensible thing to do lauren pattison  for those without savings or familial financial support the sudden closure of comedy clubs was troubling like pattison some already have new jobs pope lonergan has returned to care work a job he did for eight years until becoming a fulltime comedian in 2019  in lockdown lonergan started doing livestreams where audience members could pay through tips but it became clear he needed reliable paid work after waiting weeks for a new dbs check he’s now signed up with a care work agency where you can pick shifts at the start of each week “that will be really good going back into comedy” he says “i think a lot of comedians will be going back with secondary jobs”  although lonergan and pattison miss being on stage they’re staying positive “i find it weird that people assume i’m gutted that i’ve had to get a job” pattison says “to me it’s the most sensible thing to do”  facebook twitter pinterest ‘it’s going to be a long time until people can make a living out of live performance’ … jacob hawley  so far she’s done stints on the shop floor and customer service helpline and found unexpected upsides “at a time when everything is so chaotic” she says “having a set day where i get paid is lovely”  lonergan meanwhile is looking forward to spending time with the care home residents “i enjoy having a purpose that helps improve the lives of others and i like to chitchat the elderly because they always tell me i’m a handsome boy”  jacob hawley has been a comedian for six years and went fulltime – his “dream life” – a year ago during lockdown he’s been recording a new bbc podcast jacob hawley’s job centre in which comedians richard gadd mark olver and nish kumar discuss how work has changed during the pandemic  with twothirds of his income coming from live work and a baby on the way hawley says “this podcast came about through necessity – i had driving job applications up on my browser”  the conversations hawley is having with guests haven’t always been open subjects between comedians who is paying your rent and who has an additional noncomedy job are often shrouded in secrecy  “when i started doing standup i was working in retail and all i ever wanted to do was stop because i didn’t feel like a real comedian” hawley says “there’s a massive amount of shame around that in comedy that will have to change because it’s going to be a long time until people can make a living out of live performance again”  facebook twitter pinterest ‘i miss feeling like i’ve got a purpose’ … tom mayhew  meanwhile secrecy leaves many wondering why they’re falling behind their peers pattison says “it’s easy to think ‘how did they climb the ladder so quickly’ maybe they didn’t have to work a day job so of course they’re going to get seen more and get better quicker if more people were transparent about help they’ve had it would take the pressure off everybody”  lonergan agrees “i would love to look at every comedian’s parents’ bank account privilege is a huge thing in comedy it creates a twotier system – the ones who have financial resources can get ahead”  some comics can’t view their secondary job as a temporary lockdown measure sikisa bostwickbarnes has always juggled multiple jobs at times doing 50plus hours a week as a solicitor pub worker and comedian so she could pay student loans and support her parents this hiatus feels like a step back with comedy store and tour support gigs cancelled “i had a plan for my career and it all went up in the air” she says “my day job is intense – i work for a domestic violence charity – and having something that was creative fun and social helped my mental health”  ‘i had a plan for my career and it all went up in the air’ … sikisa bostwickbarnes  not everyone is able to work now tom mayhew would like to return to his supermarket job but doesn’t want to risk bringing the virus into the home he shares with his dad who recently had radiotherapy instead he’s enrolled on universal credit but with a sixweek wait had to use money saved for the edinburgh festival for essentials  “i need to get money so my parents can afford rent” he says “it’s very tough not being able to do live work i miss the financial side and feeling like i’ve got a purpose”  there’s concern that the loss of live comedy could also mean the loss of workingclass comics “there are more workingclass voices on the live circuit than in writers’ rooms or on television” says hawley “live work was a genuine meritocracy – anyone could get on stage it’s not perfect but it was a more even playing field that drawbridge has been pulled up”  yet says pattison workingclass comics are used to putting in the extra work that will be needed to make up for lost time “my first fringe i saved every penny of my tips to pay for it” she says “i would turn up to gigs still in my uniform i’ve always taken pride in that – what choice do i have i’m going to work for it”  there are more workingclass voices on the live circuit than in writers’ rooms or on tv jacob hawley  hawley agrees “i can’t fall back on my parents so you do have that fear but you’re used to grafting i’m going to do this podcast but then maybe i’ll be in a tesco van and gigging in the evening i hope workingclass people won’t be pushed away because they’ve got the grit to do it it’s not fair that they should have to but that’s the world we live in”  it’s unclear when live comedy will return and whether comedy venues will survive pattison says “there’s a lot of places saying they’re not going to open until next year in coming months more people will turn to other jobs which is why i wanted to get in straight away”  with such a long hiatus this could be a chance for industrywide change the recently established live comedy association is a source of hope lonergan has been elected to its steering group “i want to fight for live comedy and its preservation” he says “i want to push to make it more egalitarian”  seriously funny political comedians on humour in horrific times read more  the way we value comedy could change too during the pandemic it’s lifted moods and offered escapism many comedians making new things are empowered to request reimbursement “people before might’ve been shy asking for money” says mayhew “now they’re more likely to say ‘i need money to produce this thing’”  hawley explores this idea in his podcast “covid19 is going to grab the world and shake it up like a snowglobe i don’t think it’s going to settle the way it was people who are in underappreciated jobs are finally getting appreciation they deserve but comedy is still needed we just have to keep finding ways to make it”
520,tiktoks first auteur zach king on his madcap micro movies,he scored his first viral hit with jedi kittens now the farmboy from oregon’s joyous visual gags are making him a titan of tiktok – with 43 million followers and rising  somewhere in socially distanced southern california the sun is rising on another bright day for zach king “my mornings are family time” says the 30yearold filmmaker and father of two “then i brainstorm and write when we’re not in quarantine i work with my team but i’m figuring out productions solo at the moment”  you might assume from this that king creates bigscreen productions advertisements or maybe broadcast tv not so much of his best works last for a minute or less and are most widely viewed on digital platforms where they compete with lipsynching teenagers and eruptions of mentos dropped in diet coke with 432 million followers king is the third most popular content creator on tiktok the videosharing app he expects to rise higher “by the time this comes out we should be at no 2” he says  he’s the only man in tiktok’s top three the only nonteen among tiktok’s top five and the only one in the top 10 to have hit the age of 30 also unlike some of his contemporaries king’s appeal isn’t limited to one platform he is also a pretty big deal over on instagram 233 million followers and youtube 701 million subscribers  yet numbers aside the thing that really sets king apart are the films he makes there are no dance routines or goofy pranks his posts don’t titillate or make viewers wish that they had a nicer house body or car he never swears and he’s never ever nasty to anyone instead king uses smart specialeffects techniques to create short humorous visual tricks and jokes  you can watch him tape fizzydrinks bottles to his legs in an apparently successful attempt to create a pair of backyard jet boots in another he jumps through the driver’s side door of his prius to retrieve the keys he’s locked in his car there’s a clip in which he launches a model biplane into the sky only for the aircraft to return fullsized and knock him to the ground in another he appears to ride a harry potterstyle broomstick around a car park before being revealed as a fraud by his friends it’s just an escooter a reflective board and some other digital sleightofhand  they’re all fun superwatchable and remarkably consistent unlike a lot of shared content there’s something wonderfully wholesome about king’s videos too it wouldn’t be a complete exaggeration to say that he has a distinct cinematic style while you won’t mistake his stuff for the latest malick or almodóvar production he’s probably the closest thing tiktok has got to an auteur  king says his inspiration comes from common humdrum problems “having an everyday perspective on the world that’s what i love to do” he says recent posts during lockdown show the filmmaker – who stars in all his productions – conjuring up a seemingly endless supply of toilet paper and reaching up between the tiles in a zoom chat to steal his friends’ snacks  king’s videos have been likened to magic tricks he doesn’t deny the connection “i was really into magic in junior high” he says “my grandfather would take me around magic conventions and i would perform classic whiteglove magic” yet he never wanted to simply put those tricks online “i saw a lot of people doing stopmotion and magic but there was never a great story” he says “that’s what i wanted to add back in the story element”  king sees a stronger link between his very new form of video production and some of the world’s earliest animators and movie pioneers charlie chaplin buster keaton georges méliès and the lumière brothers are among his influences he says “they had nothing like the same technology that we have today but they were still doing these jump cuts and funny visual puns and illusions”  there are also conscious echoes of the looney tunes cartoons from the mid20th century and debts owed to steven spielberg and george lucas beloved directors from king’s youth “i was fascinated how they were using very realistic props” he recalls “and how they were engineering it all to a different level i remember trying to recreate star wars jurassic park et and indiana jones back when i was a kid”  king was born in 1990 to an ethnically diverse couple in the pacific northwest “i’m half chinese my dad is full chinese and i’m a quarter nicaraguan and a quarter austrian from my mother’s side” he says “i’m a global mix”  his parents homeschooled zach and his three younger sisters on their farm in oregon in part to nurture their offsprings’ talents “my parents were really into hard work but especially piano” king recalls “they had us practise piano a ton until we found something we really wanted to do i got placed third in oregon state in high school one year my sister was placed second”  around the time he turned eight king’s folks gave him a home video camera and asked him to film a wedding they were at “i fell in love with it” he says with the help of his sisters he copied the films he watched on the disney channel and nickelodeon “we’d recreate them and show them to the family on friday nights or over the weekend” he says “what i loved was how you could get a group of people to feel an emotion together”  remaking bigbudget productions came easily to king “since i lived on a farm it was perfect i had a forest in my back yard” he says “i had all my mini natural sets i had access to things i probably shouldn’t have had i remember setting some gasoline on fire for pyrotechnic explosions real special effects”  as he grew older king began to master more refined techniques working with the video editing software final cut pro by the time he was preparing for college he had a sufficient grasp of the program to teach others around the beginning of 2008 he started to record video tutorials for final cut at first just capturing his computer screen and walking viewers through the applications’ features “youtube was just a couple of years old back then” he says “it wasn’t like you could google anything and find a tutorial for it”  these demonstration videos didn’t make king much money but they did promote a mailorder dvd course he had put together to help pay his way through film school over time viewers suggested it might be cool if king were to post a few clips showing the effects he was describing  when you get a viral video you’re just itching to do another – to see if you can do it again  “so i got my buddy’s kittens and added lightsabers in postproduction” he says “it was just 30 seconds of cute cats playing with lightsabers” this was in the summer of 2011 when few of king’s videos had more than a couple of thousand views jedi kittens however pulled in a couple of million overnight changing the way he worked  “when you get a viral video early on – i’ve seen this with so many other creators – you’re just itching to see if you can do it again” he recalls “so i did jedi kittens strike back every great filmmaker does their sequel right it had more production value and it got a couple of million views then i set myself a weekly deadline of every friday to make a new video i was wondering whether i could do it”  king has more or less succeeded thriving first on youtube and becoming a star on vine – the shortlived video sharing service from twitter – before finding a following on instagram and subsequently tiktok which king first began posting on a few years ago  he no longer goofs off with his housemates he married his wife rachel holm in 2014 and now has two sons “people have already said that my videos are quite childlike but when we’re going out for a walk and the kids see the bugs and centipedes in the grass that you would walk past every day – that’s incredible”  a recent stroll with his children has set him thinking about a new clip working with the visual pun of “snail mail” during lockdown he and his team are working on plans to add his likeness into clips with classic cartoon characters  he’s branched out beyond this too with a series of children’s books the first of which was optioned by spielberg’s amblin entertainment production company and an appearance in the disney film zootopia however king no longer prizes cinema over smartphone entertainment while cinemas remain empty across the world viewings for his videos have risen by 50 and even as the world gets back to something like normal king still knows where his calling lies  “when i graduated film school i thought i would be going off to direct and produce big blockbuster films” he says “that was the dream but now i’m making movies for the little screen instead and i love it”  bleach beatbox and bellyflops five top

522,how to conduct a remote interview seven tips for schools hiring teachers,make sure you choose a quiet space to conduct an online interview photograph filadendrongetty images  as a result of the covid19 pandemic more schools than ever are recruiting new teachers online how can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process this handy sevenpoint guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom the teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their abcs from their hypotenuses – but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview  1 prepare your questions – and answers  an online interview is like any other – make sure you’ve set your interview agenda if you’re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you’ve decided who will ask what questions – and also who will answer any questions from your candidates key questions you should be prepared to answer would include what makes the school unique what does the school need to improve does the school provide personalised professional development how would pupils parents and other teachers describe your school and be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process  2 find a quiet space  when you’re conducting the interview make sure you’re in a quiet space with a background that is tidy and clear it’s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards simple stuff i know but you’d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning it could make the difference in a successful appointment  3 ensure your technology is up to date  it’s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you’ve got a reliable broadband connection check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call it’s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between zoom skype google hangouts or microsoft teams  4 prepare to multitask  learn how to speak to the camera lens make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera the screen and the microphone when you are not speaking for example you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises if you take time to rehearse this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down  5 offer to let candidates speak to colleagues  once you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school select a range of teachers who best represent your school to show your potential as a good employer for example a member of the support staff the school receptionist a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school you’re looking to give an indication of the school’s culture this may be difficult to achieve remotely but it’s not impossible plan to have this in place now  facebook twitter pinterest try and involve pupils either with a pupil interview or an online lesson photograph richard drurygetty images  6 offer a pupil interview if possible  technology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process if you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online it’s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise of course during a pandemic going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching facetoface watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom how do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens can they question hold to account and provide feedback to pupils online  the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview read more  7 can you offer a virtual tour  one of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school doing this remotely presents a significant challenge but again those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve beyond the school website most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site with photo galleries and online videos it’s worth making sure your school’s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public as well as pupils and parents and prospective teachers with most schools open during covid19 in a limited capacity there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently onsite to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities classrooms and office spaces this will allow potential candidates to ask questions or gain a perception of potential employment opportunities  appointing teachers during a pandemic is difficult but it’s not impossible to ensure your school isn’t missing key

523,the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview,recruiters say that both the interviewer and candidate should treat a remote interview like a traditional facetoface interview photograph cavan imagesgetty imagescavan images rf  candidates in their dressing gowns dogs and children running about partners in the background watching tv or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector david stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews “when people are working at home because it’s your personal space a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting” stone the founder of mrl consulting group says “it’s amazing what you see going on in the background”  holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept particularly for companies that have built remote international teams nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process with an influx of artificialintelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years there are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice facial expressions and speech patterns during video preassessments scoring them against an ideal profile for that role graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems  but for many companies still recruiting during the global covid19 lockdown moving the process online can be a daunting prospect stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional facetoface meeting as much as possible “get up get showered put a suit on” he says “pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet” some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person he adds “you’ve got to try and get past that build rapport put them at their ease get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax”  ellie wilson the cofounder and operations director of virtalent has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago she’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online “we can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours” she says “i certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand i ask the same questions to a candidate that i would if they were sitting right in front of me for me nothing changes – i try to extract the information that i need to be assured that this is the right person for the job can i see this person working with us working with our clients do they give me confidence”  while recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process that doesn’t have to be via a bespoke hr platform – video conference tools such as zoom skype and microsoft teams work just as well “if they’re going to be working remotely you also need to be reassured they have the right setup at home” she adds “i check that they have a dedicated desk area they have an appropriate seat and it looks free from distraction”  facebook twitter pinterest recruiters may use a video interview to check that candidates have suitable workspace at home photograph drazengetty images  candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand think about getting the lighting and camera angle right test microphones and put phones and any push notifications on silent says flexible working consultant and executive coach marilyn devonish “when speaking look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them” she adds rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen zoom has a “hide myself” option which can help she recommends interviewees also do a practice runthrough with friends or family “think about making sure your personality comes out so if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated selfstarter that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera” candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge  looking to teach at a new school here’s how to find the one that’s right for you read more  recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying “things like saying ‘right’ ‘ok’ ‘great’” devonish adds “if the sound drops this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say ‘i’m sorry i missed that’ both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly” a clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time including the necessary passwords and access links and always have a plan b “let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails they can call you and if something does go wrong watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure”  stone believes the covid19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward “this episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur” he says “we’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too just having a laptop delivered to their house they’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives”  if you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiterstheguardiancom and if you are seeking a new role at a school

524,teacher training how do you prepare to teach a new class during lockdown,it’s important when teaching remotely to make sure that every student is treated as an individual photograph damircudicgetty images  if you are a teacher looking to move between schools during the coronavirus lockdown how can you make the most of the online education experience with your new class this is interesting new territory for many teachers but there are thousands and thousands of teachers and pupils already learning remotely in virtual schools – can they offer insights  at a virtual school lessons are delivered in line with each person’s personalised curriculum exactly as you would expect in a physical school space pupils are taught how to interact with teachers their peers and lesson content using whiteboard technology quizzes voice and video as well as receiving and sending assignment tasks how should you introduce yourself to a new class if you are meeting them online for the first time if we consider how teachers deliver excellent classroom teaching practice in a physical space how they prepare should not be approached any differently in an online environment  flipped learning  “flipped learning” is a term used to describe how teachers can provide material for pupils to learn outside of the classroom although this is traditionally considered homework or coursework and typically completed without the teacher increasingly this approach to enhance learning outside of the classroom has been set and completed online during lockdown teachers will be focusing on core curriculum content meeting the needs of vulnerable pupils as well as enhancing student engagement mixing between activities types of assignments and differentiation techniques to support a range of pupils one factor that must be considered for teachers who are working remotely is how they can mix online teaching and learning with traditional methods that would be used in the physical classroom a good tip for teachers working online especially from home is to have a simple whiteboard behind the camera and teach just as you would in a physical classroom space doing this over a sustained period of time will definitely present a new challenge but it’s possible with wellthoughtout curriculum plans and a simple range of equipment  blended learning  blended learning first developed in the 1960s was a method of instruction using technologymediated methods with flipped learning being the norm during lockdown what can teachers learn from other educators who are already working in blended learning environments – teachers working in virtual schools or online tutors  if we look towards barak rosenshine’s 17 recommendations for effective teaching these can quite easily be reapplied to online teaching delivered through at least video conferencing at the start of every lesson review the last lesson with a simple retrieval exercise this supports longterm retention can easily be deployed with a simple quiz or competition and is a guaranteed way to get a lesson off to a flying start  when presenting new material successful teachers teach by giving a series of short presentations using many examples teachers should also provide guided practice by modelling various techniques where teachers present too much material at once this will confuse pupils working online without sufficient verbal and nonverbal cues means it will be critical for teachers to regularly check student responses  one way that teachers can do this is to ask a large number of questions feedback can be provided by giving prompts modelling and guiding pupils as they develop independent practice and asking simple questions such as “who where why and how” to help shape pupils’ thinking when teachers check frequently to see if all students are learning this processes information into longterm memory developing schematic concepts to support retention teaching remotely whether using microsoft teams google suite or other platforms gives teachers a significant array of strategies to deploy at this interesting time  finally research recommends that teachers should try “scaffold learning” helping pupils to problemsolve by thinking out loud and providing cognitive support this can be achieved by completing the work alongside pupils doing this online may require teachers to use “breakout spaces” by waiting to provide individual feedback in live video conferencing lessons  facebook twitter pinterest teachers delivering lessons from home should have a simple whiteboard behind them and teach just as they would in a physical classroom photograph jovanmandicgetty imagesistockphoto  flexibility and personalisation  every student should be treated as an individual online as all teachers would in a physical space and with teachers working remotely they will need to learn how to use technology as well as adapt content to meet individual needs if you are meeting your pupils for the first time i would recommend sending them a survey asking them to complete simple questions so that you can elicit initial information about their interests abilities and hopes you can then start to plan which interventions you will use in your lesson planning and delivery  to help support increased teacher workload my key recommendation would be that if teachers are able to connect with the pupils online it is important to allow students to engage in a weekly and monthly review of their learning to support longterm memory often this manifests itself when a pupil says “we’ve done this before” but effective teachers will remind pupils that this is a retrieval practice exercise to assist with longterm retention  safeguarding and security  if you are joining a virtual school then i would assume the various safeguarding procedures are already in place however if you now find yourself teaching pupils online for the first time having never met them physically you should doublecheck to ensure that your new school has considered data protection child protection internet security and the various online safeguarding procedures for teachers and pupils  how to conduct a remote interview seven tips for schools hiring teachers read more  when teaching from your own home environment it is worth reflecting on your own safeguarding procedures for example if you have not yet physically reached your new school have you received any induction or has the designated safeguarding officer spoken with you about induction procedures of the students in your register which have specific learning needs that require initial conversations with your special needs coordinator or associated form tutors all these balances and checks would be done physically on entry to a new school just because you are doing this remotely doesn’t mean that they should not happen  creating a supportive online environment  what should teachers consider when meeting their pupils online many schools will assign homelearning tasks through software or an online curriculum portal which parents can access other schools will have their teachers and pupils log on to a secure platform to complete assignments submit work and interact with the teacher through voice or text some schools will be offering live video lessons with pupils teaching from the home environment or from their school classrooms  if we look towards countries such as south korea and singapore where teachers have an almost celebritylike online presence it’s common to find them sharing videos teaching lessons through youtube or having millions of viewers on instagram  if you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiterstheguardiancom and if you are seeking a new role at a

525,looking to teach at a new school here’s how to find the one that’s right for you,be prepared for an online interview and if using unfamiliar software practice with a friend first  photograph luis alvarezgetty images  whether it’s your first job after teacher training or you’re an experienced hand evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process but how do you do that remotely here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown  prepare for remote interviews  although the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges it’s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years independent and english language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas the current lockdown has forced all schools across the uk to reconsider how they recruit teachers  be techready  on both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video what apps will they be using have you used them before if not rehearse with a friend  think the process through  it is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process this will give you motivation as well as building up a network for future job opportunities  visit the school – virtually  in order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school should you be successfully appointed under normal circumstances it’s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable under the current conditions it’s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site – just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country or an international job a conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour this is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment  prepare your application  look at the key facts listed on the job advert and evaluate how they match up with the person specification – not the job description think carefully about what you can offer the school initial research on examination performance pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application it would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school for more on this see the fiveminute interview plan regarding referees and references it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a “headsup” references are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond putting them under pressure you don’t want to put your job application in jeopardy  submitting your application  spellcheck spellcheck spellcheck whatever you do do not copy and paste bogstandard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence i’ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school’s name have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information no one needs to know your astrological birth sign ask a friend to proofread your application show the reader that you have conducted some research posing questions and thoughts as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role remember you can discuss finer details during the interview so keep the facts concise  facebook twitter pinterest ask direct questions to make sure the school’s right for you photograph westend61getty images  plan your questions  the easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview for example “how many teachers left your school last year” “how much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development’’ “why should i work at your school” “is the school budget in deficit if so by how much” if these questions are avoided it’s a good indication that this might not be the school for you  nail that interview  be prepared rehearse potential questions and answers pick out what you will wear on the day – even for an online interview show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise whatever you do do not be late in an online interview there really are no traffic excuses  teacher training how do you prepare to teach a new class during lockdown read more  have your answers ready  be prepared to answer a range of challenging questions and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers what would colleagues say about you what area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on what has been the greatest challenge in your career to date where do you want to be in three years’ time why do you want to work in this school when it comes to “awkward” questions they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response rather than the answer itself    final questions  finally asking questions at the end of an interview always have two or three questions prepared whatever you do make sure you ask them it shows the interview panel that you are prepared interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process  if you

531,gucci bids farewell to fashion week as brand goes seasonless,fashion week is over according to gucci in a virtual press conference broadcast from his rome studio the label’s creative director alessandro michele announced that gucci was slashing the number of fashion shows it holds each year from five to two  declaring the fashion week calendar obsolete michele said he was no longer adhering to a rota staked out by springsummer autumnwinter cruise and prefall shows  “i think these are stale and underfed words … clothes should have a longer life than that which these words attribute to them” he said instead the brand will show “seasonless” collections twice a year there are no plans for a show in september when the gucci collection would normally be staged as a key part of milan fashion week    the carousel of international fashion shows has been stopped in its tracks by the coronavirus crisis with menswear and haute couture shows scheduled for june and july cancelled and the september fashion weeks in doubt now a question mark hangs over not just when – but whether – the merrygoround of catwalk events will restart    michele’s comments elaborated on a series of personal diary entries posted on the gucci instagram account on sunday which made a link between “performative” fashion shows and the problem of sustainability  “above all we understand we went way too far” michele wrote “our reckless actions have burned the house we live in we conceived of ourselves as separated from nature we felt cunning and almighty”  michele who has a passion for flowery maximalism that encompasses his prose as well as his clothes added “we usurped nature we dominated and wounded it we incited prometheus and buried pan  facebook twitter pinterest the gucci

sisterhood with the butterflies the flowers the trees and the roots so much outrageous greed made us lose the harmony and the care the connection and the belonging”    gucci’s announcement is significant because the italian powerhouse is by far the mightiest brand to come out in support of a move to a leaner less wasteful fashion system  dries van noten has led a number of independent designers calling for a radical overhaul of the industry with fewer fashion shows and less product discussion on this topic has been ongoing in the industry for the past month but the superbrands have until now been mostly silent  the biggest labels which have profited the most from the system as it stands and have the necessary financial cushion to ride out the incoming economic crisis have been less motivated to radical change than smaller brands by throwing their weight behind the forces of change gucci has the ability to shift the balance of power in this conversation    last month saint laurent announced it would sit out paris fashion week this september and set its own schedule going forward a decision made in amid “waves of radical change”  facebook twitter pinterest alessandro michele has been outspoken about the pandemic photograph daniele venturelligetty images for gucci  the brand will “lead its own rhythm … and take ownership of its calendar” saint laurent’s optout was notable because its catwalk shows held on the friday evening of each paris fashion week on a huge openair catwalk directly beneath the eiffel tower have become a redletter date in the french fashion calendar drawing a supermodel cast a celebrity front row and large crowds who watch from behind barriers the absence of a marquee name central to the notion of parisian chic is a blow to paris fashion week’s status as the heart of french fashion    gucci’s revenue for 2019 was €96bn £86bn dwarfing its kering stablemate saint laurent which recorded revenue of €2bn for the same period as the largest and most profitable brand in the kering luxury group which also owns saint laurent and bottega veneta gucci exerts influence across the industry    gucci’s influence is not merely economic since taking over five years ago michele has positioned himself at the progressive edge of fashion’s engagement with culture  on the catwalk his male models wear pussybow silk blouses and babydoll dresses

533,why native americans took covid19 seriously its our reality,coronavirus is novel to the world but the impact on native communities is anything but a new experience  in the first few weeks of 2020 as president donald trump dismissed and mocked warnings about a novel virus killing people faraway in china native american leaders were taking the deadly threat seriously  and they were right  the infection rate among the navajo nation has now surpassed the state of new york the centre of the pandemic in the us and on monday stood at 2680 cases per 100000 people compared with 1890 in new york  the data emerging from some smaller tribes is even worse by midmay the known infection rate in the pueblo of zia which has a population of 934 people was 3319 per 100000 – ten times the rate of new mexico where the tribe is situated and almost double the rate of new jersey – the second worst hit us state  native americans being left out of us coronavirus data and labelled as other read more  the nearby pueblo of san felipe population 3544 is also badly affected with 3301 known cases per 100000 reporting lags mean the actual infection rate for both tribes could be significantly higher  coronavirus is novel to the world but the impact on native communities is anything but a new experience native americans feared the worst because they’ve been here before many times  european colonizers introduced sometimes deliberately an array of new infectious diseases including measles cholera typhoid and smallpox which for many decades historians believed were solely responsible for killing more than 70 of native people who had no immunity to these deadly foreign germs  “more than any other population in the country the shared experience of surviving a pandemic is in our blood it’s not historic it’s current for american indians it’s our reality we took it seriously because we had to” said desi rodriguezlonebear a social demographer at the university of arizona and citizen of the northern cheyenne tribe in montana  facebook twitter pinterest native americans of the navajo nation people pick up supplies from a food bank set up at the navajo nation town of casamero lake in new mexico on 20 may photograph mark ralstonafpgetty images  as a child rodriguezlonebear recalls being told by her grandfather not to play in certain spots where their relatives who died of smallpox and typhoid were buried  now it’s increasingly thought that the cruel conditions of colonization such as forced displacement enslavement and starvation created the perfect conditions for deadly disease outbreaks according to jeffrey olster historian at the university of oregon  “the impact of indian removals like the cherokee trail of tears forced people into horrific conditions of poverty and destitution it wasn’t just because they weren’t immune it was the conditions of colonization which made them vulnerable” said olster  this would also explain the lack of population rebound after each epidemic the same horrific conditions caused low life expectancy and high infant and maternal mortality  again experts say that parallels can be drawn with what’s happening today as the coronavirus pandemic rages across the us  the disproportionately high covid19 infection rates in indian country are attributed to chronic structural and economic inequalities such as overcrowded housing understaffed hospitals lack of running water and limited internet access – resulting from the us government’s failure to comply with treaty obligations which agreed adequate funding for basic services in exchange for vast amounts of tribal land  “back then like today tribes are trying to tackle a fatal virus without adequate resources that’s a strong historic parallel the simple failure of the federal and state governments to provide the resources necessary” said ostler  in addition high rates of medical conditions like obesity diabetes heart and lung disease have contributed to worse covid19 outcomes for instance in arizona the death rate for indigenous people is 428 per 100000 – almost six times higher than for white people in mississippi they are dying from covid19 at 10 times the rate of whites according to analysis published last week by apm research lab  native communities who rely on their elders for oral history and traditions are also concerned about the survival of their ancient cultures  “we are survivors of genocide our numbers prove it… for nations with less than a thousand citizens losing one person is too many” said rodriguezlonebear “and losing even one of our elders threatens the future of our tribal nations as it means losing our language oral histories and the cornerstones of our families and communities”  in fact the situation is likely worse as the data currently available is extremely patchy  facebook twitter pinterest a nurse takes a swab sample from a navajo indian woman complaining of virus symptoms at a testing center at the navajo nation town of monument valley in arizona on 21 may photograph mark ralstonafpgetty images  in new york where significant ethnic disparities have emerged no data is being collected on indigenous peoples “this oversight is especially hammering… it’s a painful blindspot in new york” said andi egbert senior demographer at apmresearch  more than 70 of native indians and alaskan natives live in urban areas where many use county and state health services where the data black holes exist  native peoples with covid19 are being “eliminated from the data” because their ethnicity is so frequently misclassified or ignored according to abigail echohawk director of the national tribal epidemiology centre based in seattle  “without the data we’re going to keep dying and nobody is going to acknowledge that… and resources allocated by congress won’t reach the communities” said echohawk  over recent weeks trump and his supporters have pushed for america to reopen for business even though scientists are still months from finding a vaccine or treatment  yet native communities have demonstrated a greater historical awareness of the experience of pandemics and tried to protect their citizens through measured emergency responses with limited resources but which assert their right to self determination and governance  in south dakota tribes setup roadblocks to protect their citizens after the protrump governor refused to issue a stay at home order in washington the lummi nation created the country’s first field hospital while the navajo nation the second largest tribe in the us has tested over 13 of those on the reservation compared to 4 in the us  “indigenous nations have been through so many waves of pandemics and epidemics that they have a well of resilience stamina and intergenerational knowledge that others just do not have” said jessica kolopenuk a political theorist and indigenous studies scholar at the university of alberta “i am of the strong opinion that indigenous knowledge and world views can really help change the course of this pandemic”
534,hydroxychloroquine trumps covid19 cure increases deaths global study finds,hydroxychloroquine the antimalarial drug donald trump is taking to prevent covid19 has been linked to increased deaths in patients treated with it in hospitals around the world a study has shown  a major study of the way hydroxychloroquine and its older version chloroquine have been used on six continents – without clinical trials – reveals a sobering picture scientists said the results meant the drug should no longer be given to covid19 patients except in proper research settings  while the paper published online in the lancet medical journal is not a trial designed to assess the drug it shows that the rush to use it around the world may be illadvised significant numbers of doctors have been prescribing it without evidence it is known that the drug can cause heart irregularities but many have claimed it is safe because of its long use treating malaria  hydroxychloroquine trump and covid19 what you need to know read more  there was a rush to use the drug in covid19 cases after the french doctor didier raoult said he was curing his patients at la timone hospital in marseille the us president then claimed hydroxychloroquine – less toxic than the original chloroquine – was a cure and later said he was taking it himself against coronavirus  the drugs are fairly safe for patients being treated for malaria but covid19 is a very different disease the authors of the paper pulled together results for more than 96000 patients in 671 hospitals taking one of the drugs with or without an antibiotic such as azithromycin between 20 december and 14 april  the death rate among all groups taking the drugs was higher than among people who were not given them one in six of those taking one of the drugs died while one in five died if they were taking chloroquine with an antibiotic and one in four if they were on hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic the death rate among patients not taking the drugs was one in 11  play video 112 an individual decision trump defends taking unproved coronavirus drug hydroxychloroquine – video  the statistics are not exactly comparable because as this was not a trial there were differences in the age gender general health and stage of illness of the patients but the us authors of the study say allowing for these differences there was still higher mortality among those taking the drugs  the team also found that serious cardiac arrhythmias which cause the lower chamber of the heart to beat rapidly and irregularly were more common in all the groups receiving one of the four treatment regimens the biggest increase was in the group treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic where 8 of patients developed a heart arrhythmia compared with 03 of patients not given the drugs  “this is the first largescale study to find statistically robust evidence that treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine does not benefit patients with covid19” said prof mandeep r mehra lead author of the study and executive director of the brigham and women’s hospital advanced heart disease center in boston us  “instead our findings suggest it may be associated with an increased risk of serious heart problems and increased risk of death randomised clinical trials are essential to confirm any harms or benefits associated with these agents in the meantime we suggest these drugs should not be used as treatments for covid19 outside of clinical trials”  others scientists suggested the drugs should no longer be used in covid19 treatments except for carefully controlled clinical trials  hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus a guide to the scientific studies so far read more  dr stephen griffin associate professor in the school of medicine university of leeds said the paper was “potentially a landmark study for covid19 therapy while not a placebocontrolled trial an observational study on this scale undertaken with stringent and meticulous analysis is powerful indeed” he said  “whilst controlled trials will be required for confident affirmation the indications are that these drugs certainly ought not to be used outside of a trial setting where patients can be monitored for complications one might also question whether the resources necessary for large studies might be better diverted to other causes at the same time allowing the drugs themselves to be used for their original purpose  “furthermore it is clear that highprofile endorsements of taking these drugs without clinical oversight are both misguided and irresponsible”  stephen evans professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine said it was unlikely that trials would now find any substantial benefit from the drugs “a definitive answer still awaits the results of the randomised trials but it is clear that the drugs should not be given for treatment of covid19 other than in the context of a randomised trial  “it might even be said that to go on giving them other than in a trial is unethical given this evidence that is not yet contradicted by other available evidence”  • this article was amended on 26 may

535,its against nature illegal wildlife trade casts shadow over traditional chinese medicine,experts warn the exploitation of endangered animals such as pangolin and tiger is tarnishing the industry  supporters and practitioners of traditional chinese medicine have warned that the discipline is threatened by those who continue to trade in endangered animals  the small segment of the tcm community that insists on using endangered animal parts in the pharmaceutical side of tcm ignoring welfare considerations and the idea of respecting biodiversity could destroy its reputation for good they argue  “the balance with nature is a key point of tcm and the use of endangered animals is against nature” dr lixing lao president of the virginia university of integrative medicine told the guardian  “even in the principles of tcm practice this is not good” lao said referring to tang dynasty experts 1500 years ago who believed 100 of tcm could be derived from plants  tcm encompasses many things – acupuncture therapies breathing and physical exercise eating habits related to particular conditions of the body and a variety of views about how to strike balance within the body alongside medicinal tcm drugs  for lao and others the path of reform is to abandon the use of parts derived from endangered species such as pangolins tigers leopards and rhinos  facebook twitter pinterest the dried and baked scales of the critically endangered pangolin are ground into powder for some tcm remedies photograph paul hiltonwcs  the 74bn £60bn wildlife trade in china pointed to as a likely source of covid19 has been largely perpetuated by superstition and confusion about the benefits of animal parts  until the recent nationwide pause on the wildlife trade china’s state forestry and grassland administration provided permits to tcm pharmaceutical companies to use animal parts from previous stockpiles or “farmed” wildlife  but poaching and the illegal trafficking of parts and live animals from protected species across the globe has continued the parts are sold to companies making either tcm pharmaceuticals – dried and baked pangolin scales for example are ground into powder for several treatments – or for products such as tiger and leopard bone wine advertised as having “tcm qualities”  “this is not as much a chinese medicine practitioner issue it is more the industry the people who make money” lao said “this makes chinese medicine look bad they use our tcm name for their own purpose but we’re innocent”  rhino horn and tiger bone were removed from the chinese pharmacopoeia the official listing of what is allowed in tcm in the 1980s wildlife conservation organisation traffic told the guardian that it has seen positive direction from within the tcm community in china in recent years to move away from the use of threatened species richard thomas communications director at traffic said “the issue is very much within the tcm consciousness”  facebook twitter pinterest traditional chinese medicine products are dispensed at a hospital in shanxi province photograph wei liangchina news servicegetty images  china’s government and leaders including president xi jinping have long lauded the benefits of tcm medicines xi is firmly behind the idea of combining traditional chinese and western medicine and has encouraged the acceleration of research on tcm drugs  tcm experts such as lao believe medicinal cures should be used only when absolutely necessary and not overprescribed in the way western pharmaceuticals often are instead favouring deeper preventive practices to reduce the need for medicine in the first place  but support for tcm which was formally approved into the global compendium of medical practices by the world health organization last year may dissipate if the issues at the heart of the wildlife trade – which is linked in many people’s minds to the covid19 outbreak and decimation of endangered species – are not addressed  big business  for xi and much of the country’s leadership promoting tcm is one of several ways of raising millions out of poverty by the end of 2020 china’s state council expects the total value of the country’s tcm industry to reach about 420bn according to a white paper it released four years ago in china’s tcm capital of bozhou anhui province the industry is estimated to be worth 109bn yuan 15bn  the report also indicated that there were 900 million tcm practitioners in 183 countries and growing tcm hospitals and clinics in china recorded a billion visits in 2017 and that number is increasing by about 6 a year  separately a 2017 report from the chinese academy of engineering put the total value of the wildlife industry specifically breeding parts for tcm at 50bn yuan or about 7bn  facebook twitter pinterest traders wait for customers at a traditional chinese medicine market in bozhou anhui province china photograph qilai shencorbisgetty images  that figure does not take into account the illegal trade in live animals whole dead animals and animal parts that number is likely to be many times higher judging by seizures of animal parts such as pangolin scales rhino horn and tiger bone  in february china’s national people’s congress put a full ban on any trade in terrestrial wildlife until the country’s wildlife protection law and followon regulations around the industry can be fully updated – though the main focus will likely be on bushmeat with little action expected on products used for tcm and fur or leather  moves are also afoot globally to stop all use of endangered wildlife in traditional medicine three chinese ngos and two global organisations recently proposed that all members of the international union for the conservation of nature iucn support a halt to the use of threatened species in traditional medicine  the proposal was listed by the iucn and will go before members for approval or debate in january next year no timeline for members to adopt any of the language will be available until the text is agreed upon  “we support the sustainable development of traditional medicine” linda wong deputy secretary general of the china biodiversity conservation and green development foundation one of the ngos involved in bringing the proposal forward told the guardian “we strongly disagree with the use of endangered wildlife in traditional medicine which drives species like the pangolin to extinction” she said adding that of 128 motions currently under consideration by the iucn this year it is the “most controversial”  “recent moves to reopen trade in these products appear very much businessinterest driven rather than medicinalsector driven” richard thomas told the guardian  the confusion and mixed signals over what is legal and what is illegal only adds to potential loopholes many conservation activists claim  facebook twitter pinterest a shop in indonesia selling pangolin tcm products originating in guangxi province china photograph paul hilton  debbie banks tigers and wildlife crime campaign leader at the ukbased environmental investigation agency said there are still many issues to work out in the text of the iucn motion particularly related to “sustainable use” of wildlife and adopting what is known as the fairwild standard for sourcing wild plants and applying it to wildlife  “there is a risk that advocates for captive breeding of tigers for example will use this language to argue that the ‘harvest’ of tigers bred in captivity is sustainable without taking into account that the trade in captivebred specimens sustains demand for wild specimens particularly given consumer preference for wild” banks said  banks adds that standards meant for plant species can’t simply be applied to the harvesting of wild animal products and reference in the motion should be explicitly stated as applying to plants only  “we’ve been hoping that lawmakers extend provisions to chinese medicine under the reforms to the wildlife protection law as academics and ngos in china have been proposing” said aron white china specialist at the environmental investigation agency  “the problem isn’t chinese medicine per se it’s the ingredients that are still used that are made from threatened wildlife which could be replaced by herbal or artificial alternatives as many practitioners already do” white said    bear bile and covid19  throughout the covid19 outbreak china’s leaders and staterun media have supported the tcm industry concentrating largely on the benefits of tcm pharmaceuticals as a pillar industry tcm doctor zhang boli who set up a makeshift hospital where none of the 564 carriers of covid19 that he treated with tcm drugs turned into critical cases was hailed as a success with staterun media and government officials showering him with praise  but a recent report in the journal nature indicated growing calls outside of china for more rigorous clinical trials of tcm products especially those promoted abroad as covid19 treatments these are often being sent with aid shipments of personal protective equipment  outside china the use of bile extracted from the gall bladders of captive asiatic black bears as one ingredient in tcm drugs listed by the government as treatment for severe and critical coronavirus cases has been strongly criticised by wildlife groups  facebook twitter pinterest chinese workers collect bear bile at a farm in southeast china in 2012 photograph afpgetty  “it really pains me to see that tcm is now using bear bile to treat covid19 and the amount used is so tiny” grace gabriel asia director for the international fund for animal welfare ifaw told the guardian  “why why do you want to destroy your good name and associate with that” gabriel said “the only conclusion that i can come to is that the wildlife farming industry in china has hijacked tcm’s name”  originally from china gabriel grew up during the cultural revolution and was often able to get medical assistance only from tcm doctors and counts herself as a believer in tcm’s benefits  “as a chinese person i really respect tcm and one of the underlying principles is to achieve balance within one’s own body as well as with the outside world” she said  china already has alternatives to bear bile that can be used as a substitute in tcm drugs she said but the captive breeding industry is so strong they don’t want to see those alternatives promoted  “the one thing that is missing is education” lao said “we need to educate the public that chinese medicine emphasises the balance between humans and nature so we have to respect nature”  additional reporting by jonathan zhong  find more age of extinction coverage here and follow biodiversity reporters phoebe weston and patrick

said bogdanov crediting government support but calling the size of the problem “colossal” “some of my colleagues are nervous seriously nervous but most are hanging on”  maya lomidze the executive director of the association of tour operators of russia said opening the sanatoriums could be a lifeline for those businesses but warned against overzealous regulations “i can’t say it saves the

be presumed innocent  ahmaud arbery  facebook twitter pinterest ahmaud arbery photograph twitter  the fatal shooting of ahmaud arbery a 26yearold african american as he jogged in a coastal city in the us state of georgia in february initially received little national attention the two men accused of killing him claimed they did so in selfdefence police and prosecutors showed little enthusiasm for pursuing the case  that changed with the 5 may release of a video depicting arbery’s last moments the man is trailed slowly by a car as he jogs on quiet street he reaches another vehicle and two armed men appear a struggle ensues with one and several gunshots go off the last scene shows arbery dying in the street  the shocking footage led to the arrest of the three men present at the shooting and has rekindled popular rage at the dangers black men can face in predominantly white communities and the impunity and inaction that regularly follows their deaths  the end of the twostate solution  facebook twitter pinterest benjamin netanyahu photograph adina valmanepa  once a fringe notion espoused by israel’s far right the idea the jewish state would simply declare swaths of the palestinian territories – where its settlements have been proliferating for decades – its own territory has over the past year marched into the mainstream  it may soon become israeli law the new governing alliance of benjamin netanyahu and his former election rival benny gantz plans to advance legislation in the next few months aimed at eventually declaring about 30 of the occupied west bank to be israeli territory in line with the “peace plan” released by trump in january – and roundly rejected by palestinian leaders  the trump plan calls for the annexation to take place in consultation with palestinian leaders but it is unclear what conditions – if any – the white house would impose on the netanyahugantz government the annexation was “an israeli decision” mike pompeo said recently  european leaders the un and scores of retired israeli generals and security officials have voiced their objection to the plan arguing that it would isolate israel and pour petrol on the volatile region it would also signal the death of the twostate solution the 1994 outline for peace between the israelis and palestinians that has been the framework for all subsequent negotiations but which many analysts argue has been on its deathbed for years  other stories from this year  facebook twitter pinterest harvey weinstein arrives at the manhattan criminal court in new york city photograph

538,tow truck turf wars toronto sees rise in violence likened to organised crime,just before sunset a volley of gunshots rang out in the parking lot of a northern toronto apartment complex  when police arrived they found a black tow truck pinned between two other vehicles the driver hashim kinani 23 was slumped in the front seat having been shot several times  despite efforts by the emergency crew he was pronounced dead at the scene  the brazen murder followed a week of arson attacks which left the burned remains of tow trucks scattered throughout the city  the coronavirus lockdown has quietened canada’s largest city but there has been little reprieve for an industry rife with violence and intimidation – and some towtruck owners fear that organized crime has pushed the industry to a breaking point  two boys aged 15 and 17 were charged on thursday with firstdegree and attempted murder and toronto police told the guardian they do not believe kinani’s murder was related to an ongoing turf war  but he was the fourth toronto towtruck driver to be murdered in less than two years several others have been shot – or shot at – including one who was targeted just hours after kinani’s death  in a statement to the guardian following kinani’s murder ontario’s ministry of transportation said it was “deeply concerned” by the violence in the towing industry and was working to “deter this behaviour”  a recent investigation by the globe and mail found at least 30 arson attacks targeting towtruck businesses though that figure has now risen since the spike in violence over the last few months  in march a collision reporting centre in northern toronto was set on fire another was vandalized and an accelerantdoused object found amid the broken glass say police  that same month two drivers were shot and numerous vehicles set ablaze prompting anger and frustration from ontario’s premier doug ford  “we’re coming for you and we’re going to catch you” ford warned the attackers “the party’s over”  for many drivers the violence feels unrelenting  “i worry about waking up to find my truck on fire outside of my house” one driver who has worked in the industry for 13 years told the guardian  much of trouble stems from “accident chasing” – where truck operators race their rivals to be the first at the scene of a crash  some repair garages will pay tow truck drivers a “finder’s fee” for damaged vehicles making “chasing” an incredibly lucrative field  hashim kinani the tow truck driver who was recently killed photograph toronto police service  the lure of profits – and the relative lack of oversight – has attracted organized crime last june police conducted a series of raids under the name project kraken charging more than 70 people – including seven drivers – with offenses ranging from firearms possession to conspiracy to commit murder  police recovered tasers and body armour and found that numerous drivers were armed and “prepared to shoot other towtruck operators over an ongoing battle over territory” said toronto’s police deputy chief james ramer  but nearly a year after those highprofile raids critics say the problems have only got worse  “we’ve got guys racing down the highway to be the first to arrive for a tow threaten each other bang into each other and even shoot each other things need to change” said john henderson of the fair towing task force a lobby group advocating for industry reform  henderson and others have called for greater regulation and licensing as well as the establishment of an oversight body to rein in what they say is an increasingly saturated industry with few clear standards  “trucks are just popping up every few days with new names and faces and then they disappear just as fast their one motive is to eliminate competition and own the road it’s crazy these days” said the driver  in theory the towing industry is regulated at a municipal level in ontario but according to the canadian automobile association only 17 of ontario’s 444 municipalities have clear rules meaning swaths of the province have become a freeforall for drivers looking to circumvent or exploit exiting loopholes  companies say they also want clear regulations for truck maintenance and safety – as well as better training standards for drivers  henderson says a number of “unscrupulous” drivers are using modified trucks – not actual tow trucks “if an unlicensed unregulated guy picks up your vehicle he’s never going to see you again he’s going to charge you as much as he thinks you’re going to pay”  with the government preoccupied by the coronavirus pandemic businesses worry that legislation that has been repeatedly proposed will once again be forgotten  but henderson hopes the recent shooting will put lingering crisis back in the spotlight  “because let’s be clear someone was killed” he said “we need to fix this”

they were selfisolating twice a local restaurant cooked and delivered supper for the family and when eli’s wife wanted to send him kosher food to eat and books to read lecheiris a local volunteer group took the package to the hospital for her  eli sufrin stands for a portrait in stamford hill north london he contracted the coronavirus before passover and was in hospital for nine days  hershy tunk the founder of lecheiris uk sits at his desk answering calls and monitoring whatsapp groups  left ari feferkorn prepares kosher meals at home six months ago he started bedside kosher a free homecooked meal service for jewish patients in hospital which is supported by volunteers in the community right his daughter peers over the fence at the neighbour’s children playing in the garden  across the uk communities have hastily pulled together in the pandemic with leaflets posted through doors whatsapp groups set up and crowdfunders launched many people are meeting neighbours for the first time in stamford hill north london the networks of support are well established “not on my fingers and toes could i count the times i’ve been helped by community organisations recently” sufrin said as we chatted on the street during the jewish holiday of lag b’omer  the pavement of dunsmure road gets crowded easily as pedestrians hurry past queuing shoppers  ali’s cafe restaurant on dunsmure road is among the many local businesses that have been closed since lockdown  many strictly orthodox jewish families in the stamford hill community do not have access to social media and mainstream news outlets so some were slow to grasp the severity of the situation “closeknit means we’re all there for each other and we keep in daily contact but it also means we tend to congregate more and the virus has spread much quicker” said mrs davidovits a parttime teacher and volunteer at the interlink foundation  the tottenham addas synagogue lies empty normally this room would be filled at all hours of the day with men in prayer and study  haredi men pray at least three times daily in the synagogue and some spend six or seven hours there so when britain’s chief rabbi ephraim mirvis ordered the closure of all united synagogues the largest network of orthodox synagogues in the country in the same week that schools across the uk were told to close indefinitely the community was shaken  lecheiris volunteers check an instagram story encouraging prayer for rabbi pinter who was critically ill with coronavirus he died that day 13 april  overlooking springfield park families gather on their balconies for prayer and to watch the sunset  mrs shisha and her family clap for the nhs and key workers on their street in stamford hill  sam friedman a local graphic designer saw what was going on and started a physical distancing awareness campaign putting notices in local magazines and on social media he said “for some people essential things means going to the supermarket but for some essential means what’s ideally required by the jewish law and that is prayer in groups many people have never prayed by themselves in the house setting with kids around it’s very tough these people needed an extra dose of awareness to adhere to the law”  a man wearing a protective mask and gloves checks his phone in stamford hill behind him people queue for the bank in the rain  first established in the 1920s the haredi community of stamford hill has been growing rapidly since the second world war when many arrived fleeing the holocaust it is the largest strictly orthodox jewish community in europe and makes up 7 of the population of the borough of hackney families tend to be large mrs davidovits has six children and said she had friends who had eight or nine we met one afternoon in april to discuss family life under lockdown “i think that overcrowding is probably something more unique in its severity to our community with two or three kids it’s still difficult but it’s not the same as eight kids i feel lucky to have a little outdoor space”  moses gluck has been an undertaker in stamford hill for more than 30 years  gluck moves one of the cars parked outside his building he uses these dark estate cars because they are more understated than a hearse  only 04 of the uk population is jewish but 1 of uk deaths from coronavirus have been among jews according to the board of deputies of british jews moses gluck has been an undertaker in stamford hill for 30 years he told me he had done three to four months’ work in one month alone often working until 1am as most of his staff are older and at risk he has relied on younger volunteers to help out with ritual acts such as the tahara washing the bodies “the day i would say i’m used to it i would have to leave this business … here in stamford hill we are a closeknit community we say we’re all family so to come to a family where they have just lost somebody you feel with them it’s our loss”  a team of hatzola volunteers in full ppe clean ambulances dispose of dirty linen and restock anything that has been used that day  haredi jews are expected to donate at least 10 of their earnings to charity so perhaps it’s no surprise that there is a volunteer organisation for almost everything hatzola the 247 emergency medical response team is perhaps the best known started in new york in the 1960s it is the largest voluntary ambulance organisation in the world the stamford hill branch has almost 50 volunteers and on a normal day might field 20 calls at the peak of the crisis it was receiving 80 calls a day and had to rent extra ambulances to meet the demand “some members here took more calls during this period than others did in a year it was just constant most calls were serious” said benjamin stern a hatzola volunteer of 20 years a communityfunded campaign raised more than £200000 in a few weeks to buy a new ambulance and two response cars  yoni koppel and yanky lieberman in a lift at royal london hospital  dovy sternlicht a hatzola technician sits in an ambulance at the end of a day “covid19 didn’t read the textbook” he said  yoni koppel works in property maintenance and for the last three years he has volunteered with chaveirim in his spare time chaveirim offers a free 247 service to help with breakdowns gas leaks and other odd jobs around the area but when i met him in april we drove to homerton and royal london hospital to drop off food and drink packages to the nhs staff there covid19 has forced many organisations in stamford hill to adapt to the needs of the community “at first my wife was worried” yoni said “but we have been brought up in the same area and here if people need help you have to put yourself in the frontline so she does understand”  yoni koppel drops off food and drink for staff in a covid19 ward at homerton hospital  it’s not only men volunteering to crisscross town dropping off packages and offering support but when i reached out to some of the women they politely declined to talk about it mrs davidovits told me some haredi women were leading organisations in stamford hill but they did not want to attract attention due to tzniyut a hebrew word that best translates as modesty “it’s not only about the way we dress but it’s behaviour as well and about putting ourselves out there it’s very central to our way of life for men and women”  shlomo and malky davidovits feed gitty their youngest child  left chayelle davidovits sits in the garden with her baby sister gitty while waiting for the barbecue to light right motty davidovits sits listening to his classmates between lessons which are now conducted over the phone  the virus has shone a light on cracks in every community but it has also unearthed resilience the closeknit way of life in stamford hill meant lockdown presented previously unimaginable challenges and many were at risk everybody knows people who have died equally those like eli who needed support in a moment of need have undoubtedly received it moses gluck the undertaker echoed so many i spoke to when he told me his work was not just business “there has to be heart to it” hatzola hasn’t been called to a patient showing covid19 symptoms in two weeks

564,research reveals gene role in both dementia and severe covid19,people with a genetic mutation that increases the risk of dementia also have a greater chance of having severe covid19 researchers have revealed  the study is the latest to suggest genetics may play a role in why some people are more vulnerable to the coronavirus than others and could help explain why people with dementia have been hard hit dementia is one of the most common underlying health conditions among those who have died from covid19 in england and wales  “it is not just age this is an example of a specific gene variant causing vulnerability in some people” said david melzer a professor of epidemiology and public health at exeter university and a coauthor of the study  study of twins reveals genetic effect on covid19 symptoms read more  writing in the journal of gerontology medical sciences melzer and colleagues report how they analysed data from the uk biobank a research endeavour that has collected genetic and health data on 500000 volunteers aged between 48 and 86  the team focused on a gene called apoe – this gives rise to proteins involved in carrying fats around the body and can exist in several forms one such variant called “e4” is known to affect cholesterol levels and processes involved in inflammation as well as increasing the risk of heart disease and dementia  the researchers found 9022 of almost 383000 biobank participants of european ancestry studied had two copies of the e4 variant while more than 223000 had two copies of a variant called “e3” the former the team add have a risk of dementia up to 14fold higher than the latter  the team then looked at positive tests for covid19 between 16 march and 26 april when testing for the coronavirus was largely carried out in hospitals suggesting the cases were severe  the results reveal 37 people who tested positive for covid19 had two copies of the e4 variant of apoe while 401 had two copies of the e3 variant after taking into account various factors including age and sex the team say people with two e4 variants had more than double the risk of severe covid19 than those with two e3 variants  melzer said the findings were not down to people with two e4 variants being more likely to be living in a care home – settings that have been hard hit by covid19 – since the association remained even when the team excluded participants with a diagnosis of dementia none of the covid19 positive participants with two e4 variants of the apoe gene had a dementia diagnosis  “it is pretty bulletproof – whatever associated disease we remove the association is still there so it looks as if it is the gene variant that is doing it … this association is not driven by people who actually have dementia” said melzer  the team say further work is needed to unpick the link  prof tara spiresjones an expert in neurodegeneration at the university of edinburgh who was not involved in the study said the large number of biobank participants meant the association between the apoe genetic variants and covid19 risk was robust but stressed the study did not prove the former caused the latter nevertheless she said the study was important  “it is possible that the role of apoe in the immune system is important in the disease and future research may be able to harness this to develop effective treatments” she said  fiona carragher a director of research and influencing at alzheimer’s society said people with dementia and their families were desperately worried adding the government must take urgent action to protect people with dementia but she said more research was needed to delve into the possible link between the e4 variant of apoe and severe covid19  “other factors may contribute so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions at this stage but clearly much more indepth research is urgently needed to fully understand why people with dementia seem to be at a higher risk and to what extent factors like ethnicity and genetics might play a role” she said  but prof david curtis honorary professor at the ucl genetics institute urged caution he noted that among the study’s limitations diagnoses of dementia in recent years are unlikely to be captured meaning that the link between the e4 variant and severe covid19 may still be driven by more people with two e4 variants having dementia than those with two e3 variants  “i’m afraid this study does not really convince me that the apoe e4 allele gene variant is really an independent risk factor for severe covid19 infection” he said “i would want to see this tested in a sample where dementia could be more confidently excluded perhaps a younger cohort i am sure additional data will soon emerge to illuminate this issue”

583,how to conduct a remote interview seven tips for schools hiring teachers,make sure you choose a quiet space to conduct an online interview photograph filadendrongetty images  as a result of the covid19 pandemic more schools than ever are recruiting new teachers online how can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process this handy sevenpoint guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom the teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their abcs from their hypotenuses – but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview  1 prepare your questions – and answers  an online interview is like any other – make sure you’ve set your interview agenda if you’re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you’ve decided who will ask what questions – and also who will answer any questions from your candidates key questions you should be prepared to answer would include what makes the school unique what does the school need to improve does the school provide personalised professional development how would pupils parents and other teachers describe your school and be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process  2 find a quiet space  when you’re conducting the interview make sure you’re in a quiet space with a background that is tidy and clear it’s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards simple stuff i know but you’d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning it could make the difference in a successful appointment  3 ensure your technology is up to date  it’s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you’ve got a reliable broadband connection check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call it’s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between zoom skype google hangouts or microsoft teams  4 prepare to multitask  learn how to speak to the camera lens make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera the screen and the microphone when you are not speaking for example you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises if you take time to rehearse this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down  5 offer to let candidates speak to colleagues  once you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school select a range of teachers who best represent your school to show your potential as a good employer for example a member of the support staff the school receptionist a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school you’re looking to give an indication of the school’s culture this may be difficult to achieve remotely but it’s not impossible plan to have this in place now  facebook twitter pinterest try and involve pupils either with a pupil interview or an online lesson photograph richard drurygetty images  6 offer a pupil interview if possible  technology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process if you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online it’s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise of course during a pandemic going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching facetoface watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom how do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens can they question hold to account and provide feedback to pupils online  the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview read more  7 can you offer a virtual tour  one of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school doing this remotely presents a significant challenge but again those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve beyond the school website most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site with photo galleries and online videos it’s worth making sure your school’s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public as well as pupils and parents and prospective teachers with most schools open during covid19 in a limited capacity there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently onsite to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities classrooms and office spaces this will allow potential candidates to ask questions or gain a perception of potential employment opportunities  appointing teachers during a pandemic is difficult but it’s not impossible to ensure your school isn’t missing key

584,the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview,recruiters say that both the interviewer and candidate should treat a remote interview like a traditional facetoface interview photograph cavan imagesgetty imagescavan images rf  candidates in their dressing gowns dogs and children running about partners in the background watching tv or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector david stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews “when people are working at home because it’s your personal space a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting” stone the founder of mrl consulting group says “it’s amazing what you see going on in the background”  holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept particularly for companies that have built remote international teams nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process with an influx of artificialintelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years there are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice facial expressions and speech patterns during video preassessments scoring them against an ideal profile for that role graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems  but for many companies still recruiting during the global covid19 lockdown moving the process online can be a daunting prospect stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional facetoface meeting as much as possible “get up get showered put a suit on” he says “pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet” some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person he adds “you’ve got to try and get past that build rapport put them at their ease get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax”  ellie wilson the cofounder and operations director of virtalent has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago she’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online “we can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours” she says “i certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand i ask the same questions to a candidate that i would if they were sitting right in front of me for me nothing changes – i try to extract the information that i need to be assured that this is the right person for the job can i see this person working with us working with our clients do they give me confidence”  while recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process that doesn’t have to be via a bespoke hr platform – video conference tools such as zoom skype and microsoft teams work just as well “if they’re going to be working remotely you also need to be reassured they have the right setup at home” she adds “i check that they have a dedicated desk area they have an appropriate seat and it looks free from distraction”  facebook twitter pinterest recruiters may use a video interview to check that candidates have suitable workspace at home photograph drazengetty images  candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand think about getting the lighting and camera angle right test microphones and put phones and any push notifications on silent says flexible working consultant and executive coach marilyn devonish “when speaking look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them” she adds rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen zoom has a “hide myself” option which can help she recommends interviewees also do a practice runthrough with friends or family “think about making sure your personality comes out so if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated selfstarter that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera” candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge  looking to teach at a new school here’s how to find the one that’s right for you read more  recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying “things like saying ‘right’ ‘ok’ ‘great’” devonish adds “if the sound drops this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say ‘i’m sorry i missed that’ both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly” a clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time including the necessary passwords and access links and always have a plan b “let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails they can call you and if something does go wrong watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure”  stone believes the covid19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward “this episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur” he says “we’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too just having a laptop delivered to their house they’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives”  if you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiterstheguardiancom and if you are seeking a new role at a school

585,teacher training how do you prepare to teach a new class during lockdown,it’s important when teaching remotely to make sure that every student is treated as an individual photograph damircudicgetty images  if you are a teacher looking to move between schools during the coronavirus lockdown how can you make the most of the online education experience with your new class this is interesting new territory for many teachers but there are thousands and thousands of teachers and pupils already learning remotely in virtual schools – can they offer insights  at a virtual school lessons are delivered in line with each person’s personalised curriculum exactly as you would expect in a physical school space pupils are taught how to interact with teachers their peers and lesson content using whiteboard technology quizzes voice and video as well as receiving and sending assignment tasks how should you introduce yourself to a new class if you are meeting them online for the first time if we consider how teachers deliver excellent classroom teaching practice in a physical space how they prepare should not be approached any differently in an online environment  flipped learning  “flipped learning” is a term used to describe how teachers can provide material for pupils to learn outside of the classroom although this is traditionally considered homework or coursework and typically completed without the teacher increasingly this approach to enhance learning outside of the classroom has been set and completed online during lockdown teachers will be focusing on core curriculum content meeting the needs of vulnerable pupils as well as enhancing student engagement mixing between activities types of assignments and differentiation techniques to support a range of pupils one factor that must be considered for teachers who are working remotely is how they can mix online teaching and learning with traditional methods that would be used in the physical classroom a good tip for teachers working online especially from home is to have a simple whiteboard behind the camera and teach just as you would in a physical classroom space doing this over a sustained period of time will definitely present a new challenge but it’s possible with wellthoughtout curriculum plans and a simple range of equipment  blended learning  blended learning first developed in the 1960s was a method of instruction using technologymediated methods with flipped learning being the norm during lockdown what can teachers learn from other educators who are already working in blended learning environments – teachers working in virtual schools or online tutors  if we look towards barak rosenshine’s 17 recommendations for effective teaching these can quite easily be reapplied to online teaching delivered through at least video conferencing at the start of every lesson review the last lesson with a simple retrieval exercise this supports longterm retention can easily be deployed with a simple quiz or competition and is a guaranteed way to get a lesson off to a flying start  when presenting new material successful teachers teach by giving a series of short presentations using many examples teachers should also provide guided practice by modelling various techniques where teachers present too much material at once this will confuse pupils working online without sufficient verbal and nonverbal cues means it will be critical for teachers to regularly check student responses  one way that teachers can do this is to ask a large number of questions feedback can be provided by giving prompts modelling and guiding pupils as they develop independent practice and asking simple questions such as “who where why and how” to help shape pupils’ thinking when teachers check frequently to see if all students are learning this processes information into longterm memory developing schematic concepts to support retention teaching remotely whether using microsoft teams google suite or other platforms gives teachers a significant array of strategies to deploy at this interesting time  finally research recommends that teachers should try “scaffold learning” helping pupils to problemsolve by thinking out loud and providing cognitive support this can be achieved by completing the work alongside pupils doing this online may require teachers to use “breakout spaces” by waiting to provide individual feedback in live video conferencing lessons  facebook twitter pinterest teachers delivering lessons from home should have a simple whiteboard behind them and teach just as they would in a physical classroom photograph jovanmandicgetty imagesistockphoto  flexibility and personalisation  every student should be treated as an individual online as all teachers would in a physical space and with teachers working remotely they will need to learn how to use technology as well as adapt content to meet individual needs if you are meeting your pupils for the first time i would recommend sending them a survey asking them to complete simple questions so that you can elicit initial information about their interests abilities and hopes you can then start to plan which interventions you will use in your lesson planning and delivery  to help support increased teacher workload my key recommendation would be that if teachers are able to connect with the pupils online it is important to allow students to engage in a weekly and monthly review of their learning to support longterm memory often this manifests itself when a pupil says “we’ve done this before” but effective teachers will remind pupils that this is a retrieval practice exercise to assist with longterm retention  safeguarding and security  if you are joining a virtual school then i would assume the various safeguarding procedures are already in place however if you now find yourself teaching pupils online for the first time having never met them physically you should doublecheck to ensure that your new school has considered data protection child protection internet security and the various online safeguarding procedures for teachers and pupils  how to conduct a remote interview seven tips for schools hiring teachers read more  when teaching from your own home environment it is worth reflecting on your own safeguarding procedures for example if you have not yet physically reached your new school have you received any induction or has the designated safeguarding officer spoken with you about induction procedures of the students in your register which have specific learning needs that require initial conversations with your special needs coordinator or associated form tutors all these balances and checks would be done physically on entry to a new school just because you are doing this remotely doesn’t mean that they should not happen  creating a supportive online environment  what should teachers consider when meeting their pupils online many schools will assign homelearning tasks through software or an online curriculum portal which parents can access other schools will have their teachers and pupils log on to a secure platform to complete assignments submit work and interact with the teacher through voice or text some schools will be offering live video lessons with pupils teaching from the home environment or from their school classrooms  if we look towards countries such as south korea and singapore where teachers have an almost celebritylike online presence it’s common to find them sharing videos teaching lessons through youtube or having millions of viewers on instagram  if you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiterstheguardiancom and if you are seeking a new role at a

586,looking to teach at a new school here’s how to find the one that’s right for you,be prepared for an online interview and if using unfamiliar software practice with a friend first  photograph luis alvarezgetty images  whether it’s your first job after teacher training or you’re an experienced hand evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process but how do you do that remotely here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown  prepare for remote interviews  although the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges it’s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years independent and english language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas the current lockdown has forced all schools across the uk to reconsider how they recruit teachers  be techready  on both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video what apps will they be using have you used them before if not rehearse with a friend  think the process through  it is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process this will give you motivation as well as building up a network for future job opportunities  visit the school – virtually  in order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school should you be successfully appointed under normal circumstances it’s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable under the current conditions it’s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site – just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country or an international job a conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour this is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment  prepare your application  look at the key facts listed on the job advert and evaluate how they match up with the person specification – not the job description think carefully about what you can offer the school initial research on examination performance pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application it would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school for more on this see the fiveminute interview plan regarding referees and references it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a “headsup” references are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond putting them under pressure you don’t want to put your job application in jeopardy  submitting your application  spellcheck spellcheck spellcheck whatever you do do not copy and paste bogstandard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence i’ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school’s name have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information no one needs to know your astrological birth sign ask a friend to proofread your application show the reader that you have conducted some research posing questions and thoughts as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role remember you can discuss finer details during the interview so keep the facts concise  facebook twitter pinterest ask direct questions to make sure the school’s right for you photograph westend61getty images  plan your questions  the easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview for example “how many teachers left your school last year” “how much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development’’ “why should i work at your school” “is the school budget in deficit if so by how much” if these questions are avoided it’s a good indication that this might not be the school for you  nail that interview  be prepared rehearse potential questions and answers pick out what you will wear on the day – even for an online interview show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise whatever you do do not be late in an online interview there really are no traffic excuses  teacher training how do you prepare to teach a new class during lockdown read more  have your answers ready  be prepared to answer a range of challenging questions and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers what would colleagues say about you what area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on what has been the greatest challenge in your career to date where do you want to be in three years’ time why do you want to work in this school when it comes to “awkward” questions they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response rather than the answer itself    final questions  finally asking questions at the end of an interview always have two or three questions prepared whatever you do make sure you ask them it shows the interview panel that you are prepared interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process  if you
