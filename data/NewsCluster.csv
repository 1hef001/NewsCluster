0,UK economy shrank by a record 5.8% in March. Much more pain is to come,"London (CNN Business) The UK economy shrank by a record 5.8% in March as the coronavirus caused huge swaths of business to seize up and the government imposed measures to contain the pandemic.  The contraction is the worst since monthly record keeping began in 1997, according to the UK Office for National Statistics. GDP for the first three months of the year fell 2% compared to the previous quarter, the sharpest decline since the global financial crisis.  ""With the arrival of the pandemic nearly every aspect of the economy was hit in March, dragging growth to a record monthly fall,"" said Jonathan Athow, an economic statistician at the Office for National Statistics. ""Services and construction saw record declines on the month with education, car sales and restaurants all falling substantially,"" he added.  The recession likely gathered significant pace in April and May. UK shops, pubs, restaurants, theaters, cinemas and gyms were only closed in the final week of March, when the government tightened lockdown measures in an effort to contain the pandemic.  ""March's GDP figures showed that the UK economy was already in freefall within two weeks of the lockdown going into effect. And with the restrictions in place until mid-May and then only lifted very slightly, April will be far worse,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.  Read More"
1,Why Gen Z will be hit the hardest by the financial fallout from coronavirus,"London (CNN Business) Will Murrell had hoped to pass his further education exams this summer, at a college in London. He was hunting for a job, in a retail outlet or supermarket , to earn some extra money alongside his studies.  Then Covid-19 struck. Now the 17-year-old is stuck at home with his parents. His exams have been canceled and all his plans are on hold.  ""I've been looking for jobs and now we're in lockdown, so I can't,"" Murrell told CNN. ""It seems like an unnecessary risk.""  Murrell is part of Generation Z, those born after 1997, as defined by the Pew Research Center . The group's eldest members are now graduating into a labor market that's been devastated by the global pandemic.  As a disease, coronavirus disproportionately preys on the elderly. But Generation Z, at least in the short term, is set to bear the brunt of the ensuing financial chaos.  Generation Z's future prospects also look gloomy; the Resolution Foundation's analysis suggests that layoffs linked to the pandemic could affect young people's pay and job prospects in the long-term.  The world is still in the early stages of the most severe economic crisis since the 1930s, with lockdown measures, social distancing and lost production triggering a global recession . In the United Kingdom, the economy could shrink by 14% this year and unemployment is expected to hit 9%.  The impact of unemployment in a recession is particularly severe on those who have just left school. Fewer jobs and internships are available to younger people searching for work, especially in sectors such as hospitality, travel and retail, which provide large numbers of entry level roles and have been slammed especially hard by the effects of the pandemic and efforts to contain it.  In the UK, the unemployment rate for 18-24 year-olds is projected to hit a staggering 27% this year, up from 10.5% in 2019, according to analysis from the Resolution Foundation  This means an extra 640,000 people in the age group are likely to be out of work.  ""The unique nature of the current crisis has damaged the first rung on the employment ladder for a substantial proportion of education leavers -- and it is so far unclear when, and to what extent, these sectors will recover,"" the report notes.  Young bear brunt of crisis  The crisis could leave lasting scars. Thanks to the spike in UK unemployment, today's graduates are 13% less likely to be employed in three years' time compared to a scenario without the pandemic.  Those with mid-level qualifications are 27% less likely to be employed in three years, while the figure rises to 37% for ""lower-skilled"" adults leaving education today, according to the report's projections.  It's a similar story in the United States, where workers under 24 were disproportionately affected by initial layoffs related to coronavirus, according to Richard Fry, senior researcher at the Pew Center.  The shutdown triggered a surge in unemployment in the US, with the county's economy losing 20.5 million jobs in April, the largest decline since the government began tracking the data in 1939.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , unemployment rates in April rose sharply among all major worker groups. The unemployment rate for teenagers aged 16-19 was the highest of all the groups, at 31.9%.  The unemployment rate for adult men in April was 13%, while the same figure for adult women was 15.5%.  ""Initially, at least, layoffs were concentrated in a certain set of industries, which hit the 16-24 age group hard,"" Fry told CNN. ""That initial unemployment was very much concentrated on ... Gen Z. [They] got hit badly.""  Those currently most at risk of layoffs work in retail, in restaurants, hotels and child care -â€” sectors most affected by social-distancing restrictions. Overall, younger workers make up 24% of those employed in industries at high risk of being shut down in the pandemic, according to the Pew Research Center.  Despite the early data, Fry said Generation Z has some reason to be optimistic. He said the younger group has time to recover from the virus' impact, especially when compared to the Millennial generation.  ""When it comes to wealth-building, one is ... able to better deal with a crisis if you ... have more years to adjust,"" Fry said.  While Fry is cautiously optimistic about Generation Z's prospects, research from the Resolution Foundation suggests that those who leave education during recessions suffer from lower unemployment rates and depressed pay for years after the event.  ""For several years after having left education, employment rates across the cohorts that left education during the [2008] financial crisis were lower than for those who left education after it -- with non-graduates experiencing the largest and longest scarring effects,"" the organization's report notes  Fry added that early anecdotal data showed young adults were drawing on family resources to survive the downturn, often by continuing to live with their parents or by moving back to the family home.  ""During the [2008] recession, Millennials dealt with [the crash] by moving in with Mom and Dad,"" he said. ""We may be seeing Gen Z do the same here. And that's not a path that's as open to older Millennials now. They may have families of their own and aren't able to access those resources. But I don't think we know the long-term impact of this yet. We just don't know how long and deep this downturn is going to be.""  Second setback for Millennials  While the immediate crisis has disrupted Generation Z's education and job prospects, it is the latest in a series of blows for Millennials. The group, which consists of people born between 1981 and 1996, has been shaped by the 2008 global financial crisis and the slow economic recovery that followed.  In 2014, male millennial household heads in the US were found to be earning 10% less than their equivalents in the baby boomer generation in 1978, according to a study by the US Federal Reserve Board . Millennial women were slightly better off than their boomer counterparts, but still earning 3% less than their Generation X equivalents in 1998.  The Pew Research Center defines members of Generation X as those currently aged between 39 and 54, while the baby boomers are aged 55 to 73  ""[The Millennial generation] is a particularly aggrieved cohort of young adults,"" Reid Cramer, non-resident fellow at the New America Foundation, told CNN. ""Already their prime work and family forming years were significantly undermined by coming of age in the great recession.""  ""They have lower savings. They have a lower trajectory for [building] long-term wealth. And many are not living in individual households -- instead they're in communal arrangements or still with their parents.""  Millennials also have less of a savings buffer to see them through the coming disruption. Between 2014 and 2016, 52% of British people aged 22-29 had no money set aside in a saving accounts, according to the Office for National Statistics.  In the US, 27% of the age group have no savings, according to a Bank of America report released in January. Despite this, nearly a quarter of those aged 24-41 who did save had more than $100,000 in savings.  Unlike Generation Z, Millennials did not graduate amid what may be the worst global recession since the 1930s. But that's all likely to be cold comfort for a group that, in the United States, is on track to be the first generation not to accumulate more wealth than their parents.  Searching for solutions  Cramer believes that young people need greater help from government to recover from the financial impact of Covid-19. He argues that public policy should be used to address ""the overhang of student debt"" hindering millennials in the US.  A similar sentiment is growing in the UK, with regards to housing policy. Home ownership rates among the young have dropped, with Britons in their 30s and 40s three times more likely to be renting today than 20 years ago.  ""Millennials are enormously, enormously disadvantaged when it comes to housing,"" said Jim O'Neill, chair of the Chatham House think tank and a member of Britain's House of Lords. ""I hope there's more [government] focus in the future on providing social [...] and affordable housing.""  Cramer told CNN the recession following 2008 had affected Millennials in another way -- the group is reaching the traditional markers of adulthood at later dates, or not at all.  ""In America Millennials have a significantly lower home ownership rate but that only captures some of the challenges,"" he said. ""Fewer are of them are getting married [and] having children. These were traditional elements of the aspirational American Dream.""  That dream was perhaps best captured by the baby boomers, who remain the richest generation in both the US and UK. This doesn't look likely to change soon, with Millennials enduring reduced social and economic progress and Generation Z now facing a similar fate."
2,Spain to impose 14-day quarantine for international arrivals,"(CNN) â€” Spain will implement a 14-day mandatory quarantine for travelers arriving from overseas starting Friday, according to a decree from the country's health ministry.  The decree covers ""people coming from other countries, on their arrival in Spain.""  Travelers will be required to provide a completed passenger location card to the authorities so they can be contacted during quarantine, and will have to quarantine at home or in their place of accommodation.  They will be allowed out for essential needs like food, pharmaceutical products, visiting healthcare centers and for emergency situations, but are required to wear a mask if they go outside.  Related content Trapped in paradise: Breaking quarantine could mean prison time for tourists in Hawaii  Some people, like freight carriers and healthcare workers, will be exempt from the quarantine rules as long as they have not been in contact with any known patients.  Spain remains under a state of emergency , which began on March 14 with strict stay-at-home confinement orders. It is in place until at least May 23, but officials have begun to ease some restrictions in low-risk territories.  ""During the period of de-escalation, the monitoring and health control measures for all international travelers (arriving in Spain) should be increased, to avoid the imported cases,"" said the order from the health ministry."

4,Vongfong is the first named storm of the year in the West Pacific,"(CNN) The 2020 West Pacific typhoon season is off to a slow start. It took until Tuesday for the first named storm of the year -- Vongfong -- to form, but it has quickly become a threat to the Philippines.  The West Pacific typhoon season doesn't have a defined beginning and end like the Atlantic hurricane season as storms can form throughout the year. While the peak of the typhoon season is late summer, there are frequently named storms in the winter or early spring due to the warm waters of the Pacific.  This is the eighth-latest start to the season since 1950, according to Colorado State University research scientist Phil Klotzbach. The last time we had a later start was 2016 when the first named storm of the season didn't arrive until the first week of July.  Tropical Storm Vongfong  Tropical Storm Vongfong is located just east of the central Philippines and is slowly drifting northward. During the day Wednesday the storm is forecast to slowly turn to the west and begin to approach the central Philippines.  Read More"
5,Afghan President orders resumption of offensive operations against the Taliban in blow to Trump's deal,"(CNN) The Trump administration's peace deal with the Taliban was dealt yet another blow Tuesday as the Afghan government announced it was resuming offensive operations against the insurgent group following a spate of deadly terrorist attacks.  Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani announced the resumption of offensive operations during a televised address to the nation that took place in the wake of several deadly terrorist attacks , including one that targeted a maternity hospital that killed at least 13 people, including two newborn babies.  ""I strongly condemn recent attacks on a hospital in Kabul and Nangarhar province which killed a number of innocent people including women and children,"" Ghani said Tuesday.  The Taliban denied being responsible for the attack on the hospital and a second attack on a funeral procession that took place in Nangarhar province on Tuesday.  As part of the deal negotiated between the Trump administration and the Taliban, the Afghan government, although not party to the agreement, agreed to suspend offensive operations against the Taliban and expressed willingness to partake in a ceasefire with the insurgent group.  The ""Taliban have rejected our repeated call for a ceasefire, calls for ceasefire doesn't mean weakness,"" Ghani said Tuesday, adding: ""I once again call on them to embrace peace, which is not only a demand of the government but the nation and international community.""  However, in the weeks following the signing of the deal, the Taliban ramped up its attacks on Afghan soldiers and police and the number of civilian deaths attributed to the group also increased, according to the UN.  Asked about Kabul's resumption of offensive operations against the Taliban, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Tuesday she had no new information to provide on the matter.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement later Tuesday condemning the two attacks and calling them ""horrific"" and ""unconscionable"" while making no direct reference to the resumption of offensive operations by Afghanistan's military.  ""We note the Taliban have denied any responsibility and condemned both attacks as heinous. The Taliban and the Afghan government should cooperate to bring the perpetrators to justice,"" Pompeo said, adding that ""as long as there is no sustained reduction in violence and insufficient progress towards a negotiated political settlement, Afghanistan will remain vulnerable to terrorism.""  The Pentagon referred CNN to the government of Afghanistan but said the US military would continue to conduct ""defensive strikes"" in support of Afghan National Security and Defense forces (ANDSF).  ""The US military will continue to conduct defensive strikes against the Taliban when they attack our ANDSF partners,"" Defense Department spokesman Lt. Col. Thomas Campbell told CNN.  The Pentagon has recently ceased providing data on the number of Taliban attacks and the number of US airstrikes in Afghanistan, citing the sensitivities involved in the negotiations with the Taliban.  A US defense official told CNN that the US military conducted nearly 100 such defensive strikes against the Taliban during the month of March.  The Pentagon did not answer questions as to whether the US military would come to the aid of Afghan forces if they were attacked while participating in offensive operations or whether the US would provide intelligence, logistical or other support to such anti-Taliban operations.  Earlier Tuesday, Afghanistan's national security adviser suggested that there is no point to ""peace talks"" when the Taliban do not intend to pursue peace.  ""The attacks of the last two months show us and the world that Taliban & their sponsors do not and did not intend to pursue peace,"" Hamdullah Mohib wrote on twitter.  ""If the Taliban can not control the violence, or their sponsors have now subcontracted their terror to other entities â€”which was one of our primary concerns from the beginningâ€” then their (sic) seems little point in continuing to engage Taliban in 'peace talks,' "" he added.  ""The reason to pursue peace is to end this senseless violence. This is not peace, nor its beginnings,"" he wrote.  ""There is no real alternative to peace,"" a State Department official said in response to the tweets from Hamdullah, noting that the national security adviser who has been a harsh critic of the US-Taliban talks in the past may be looking for a way to derail peace with the Taliban. The official added that without the peace process the US believes there would be more violence in Afghanistan, not less.  While the peace deal negotiated by the Trump administration continues to suffer setbacks amid rising Taliban violence, the US military has continued to withdraw troops from the country despite the Pentagon saying that the Taliban are not adhering to their commitments under the deal.  The US plans to draw down its forces in Afghanistan to about 8,600 personnel by mid-July, a reduction of some 4,000 troops from when the agreement was signed.  ""We know that we can do all of the missions we need to do at 8,600, but we are not going to be blamed for not living up to our end of the agreement,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters last week.  Asked about the attacks in Afghanistan on Tuesday, US national security adviser Robert O'Brien said that ""it's now time for the Afghan people to get together, to enter into a meaningful peace process, and it's time for America to come home. We've got a lot to focus on here."""
6,Midwives face fear and new challenges as the coronavirus spreads in Africa,"(CNN) When midwife Philomena Owusu Domfe gets up for work every day she is scared.  Domfe has been at the Ridge Hospital in Accra, Ghana's capital city, for eight years. Now each day she shows up to work, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in her country grows.  Ghana had more than 4,200 confirmed cases and 22 deaths resulting from the virus as of May 12. And while social distancing is prescribed by the World Health Organization as a key defense against the spread of Covid-19, Domfe said it's difficult when proximity with her patients and their newborns is a job requirement.  ""It is a big challenge,"" she told CNN. ""I am scared but it is the work I have chosen to do, so I have to render my services.""  Adapting to Covid-19  Midwives like Domfe have to protect themselves and, at the same time, sustain the level of care for expectant mothers. To do so, they have adjusted how they operate.  ""We have given numbers to pregnant women so that if they have any problem, they can call us. It's not like before where they (could) come in at any time,"" said Domfe.  According to her, prenatal classes don't take place as often as they used to before the pandemic. And when they do, pregnant women at the clinic are given different appointment times to limit the numbers.  The nurses also inquire about their travel history in addition to other routine checks.  ""We check for their travel history so that if we suspect that the client may be a potential Covid-19 patient, then we place them in a holding center where samples will be taken and they will be tested for the virus,"" Domfe said.  Like many other health care workers on the continent, midwives must use protective gear while attending to their patients.  Fatou Joof, who has worked as a midwife for 15 years in the Gambia, told CNN that she puts on gloves and wears her mask all the time. ""We are always using safety precautions ... we use masks, we hand-wash, we wear gloves,"" she explained.  Midwife Fatou Joof examines a woman at the Serrekunda Health Centre.  As prescribed by the WHO, face masks can protect the wearer from large-particle droplets, and help prevent the spread of infection from the person wearing the mask to others.  Joof works at the Serrekunda Health Center, 12 kilometers from the Gambian capital city, Banjul.  While she worries about working as the virus has infected more than 90,000 health workers worldwide, she said she is comforted by the fact that she is protecting herself and saving lives.  ""We cannot leave the mothers, we have to attend to them during antenatal and postnatal. I'm motivated to do this because I save lives. The lives of mothers,"" she said.  Inadequate handwashing facilities  But Joof may be one of the lucky ones. Many midwives do not have access to resources like clean water and soap needed to protect themselves from Covid-19.  Patricia Mwenyeheri, a midwife in Malawi said there are only two handwashing basins at the Mzandu Health Center where she works.  ""We have been provided with two handwashing facilities. The problem is that at the maternity ward, we have several departments which means that we need to have more of such hands-free facilities which are critical during this Covid-19 pandemic,"" she said in an interview with international charity WaterAid.  Patricia Mwenyeheri uses one of the two hand basins at the health center where she works.  WaterAid provided Mwenyeheri's health center with water connections for its toilets, handwashing basins, and bathrooms.  Mwenyeheri's department -- the maternity ward -- has access to only one of the handwashing basins, making it difficult to ensure washing of hands with soap and water as advised by the WHO.  ""On average, we attend to more than 300 clients. So, having one handwashing facility for all of them is difficult to manage but we insist that everyone should wash their hands before we attend to them,"" she said.  Delivering babies  According to UNICEF, an estimated 116 million babies will be born under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Joof said she is worried about delivering babies during the pandemic because social distancing cannot apply at the point of delivery.  ""You have to go close to the woman and deliver the baby so you protect yourself by washing your hands, putting on gloves, and using masks always,"" she said.  Dr. Daniel Roshan, an obstetrician-gynecologist based in the US, said in situations where the expectant mother has Covid-19, doctors and midwives should wear protective garments including overalls.  ""If there is a patient known to have Covid-19 they can limit the exposure of health care workers in the labor room by using just one doctor and one nurse,""' he told CNN.  Roshan, who is also the founder of Rosh Maternal and Fetal Medicine , a center providing gynecological care, said mothers cannot transfer the virus to their newborns from the womb but can after delivery due to exposure.

MUST WATCH Nigerian citizen: I prefer to die from Covid-19 than hunger 01:47  Mothers who have tested positive for the virus should be separated from their babies until they become asymptomatic, he said.  ""If the mother refuses and wants to be with the baby then it is up to her. She should not be forced but she has to understand the risk that comes with that,"" he added.  But the work does not end with the birth of babies. Midwives and other health care workers have to teach new mothers how they can prevent themselves and their babies from contracting the virus.  Domfe said she and her colleagues are telling new moms to discourage family members from holding their babies as visitors can also bring infections into the home.  Mothers also have to wash their hands thoroughly and maintain good hygiene while breastfeeding, she said.  Domfe said working during the pandemic is overwhelming because there is a lot of adapting to do. But she stays motivated by reminding herself that she is helping hundreds of women through difficult times.  ""I protect myself and pray to God to protect me,"" she said."
7,"While the wealthy self-isolate, the poor can't afford to stay put in Sao Paulo","Sao Paulo (CNN) The glass towers in Sao Paulo's financial district are shuttered, bars closed and restaurants open only for delivery. But on the outskirts of the city, residents say they can't afford to stop working, even if it means risking their lives.  ""If you stay at home, you'll just starve to death,"" said Dejair Batista, who owns a hair salon in Brasilandia, one of the biggest favelas and the deadliest neighborhood in terms of Covid-19 fatalities, according to the Sao Paulo Municipal Health Secretariat. More than 120 residents have died from complications related to the virus so far, according to officials.  Overall, Brazil is Latin America's hardest-hit country , with the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus climbing by the thousands every day. The death toll has topped 12,000 with more than 177,000 confirmed cases, according to health officials. Nearly 4,000 of the deaths are in Sao Paulo state.  An aerial view of Brasilandia amidst the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on May 10, 2020 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed Covid-19 as a ""little flu"" and urged businesses to reopen even as many governors scramble to implement social-isolation measures and slow the spread. Sao Paulo has been under quarantine since March.  On a recent afternoon Batista cracked open the sliding metal door to his salon, put on a mask and called out to potential clients that he was open, defying a state-wide order to close all but essential businesses.  ""If I could choose, I would stay at home. But I have to go out, there is no other way,"" Batista said, explaining that he supports his sister and his niece. ""I'm behind on all of my bills, last month, this month.""  Brasilandia, built into the hills in the northern part of Sao Paulo, is home to more than 260,000 people. In all, according to the official census, more than 11 percent of the city's residents live in favelas and many of them work in the informal economy that has largely disappeared during the coronavirus crisis.  Residents wait for food donations organized by NGO Kapadocia Institute for poor families from Capadocia Slum at Brasilandia district amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, May 1, 2020.  Nair Barbosa cleaned houses, but was let go when the family she worked for started sheltering at home. She has signed up for the temporary federal unemployment benefit worth $100 a month and waited in a crowded line with other residents for over an hour at the government agency office in Brasilandia to pick up her first check. She came out empty handed.  ""The system crashed,"" she said. ""I'll have to go home and come back later today.""  According to Sao Paulo Health Secretary Edson Aparecido, although coronavirus was brought to Brazil by wealthy travelers returning from vacations in Italy and the Colorado ski slopes, the poor will be hit hardest.  ""Where people are dying is on the outskirts of the city. That's why social isolation is so important,"" Aparecido said.  But, as with many of the favelas, social isolation is very difficult in Brasilandia. Multiple generations are often packed under one roof and there are few public parks or other public spaces. For healthcare, there are clinics, but no big hospitals.  ""It started as the so-called imported virus by people living in better conditions,"" said Aparecido. ""But now that it's gone to the outskirts, you can see what's happening."""
8,Cuba slams US over shooting attack on embassy in Washington,"Havana (CNN) Cuba's foreign minister on Tuesday lashed out at the Trump administration for ""complacent silence"" following a shooting at the Cuban Embassy in Washington, DC , and for trying to thwart Cuban efforts to battle the coronavirus.  ""In the midst of the pandemic, the Secretary of State Mr. [Mike] Pompeo is constantly advocating against Cuban medical cooperation and slandered Cuban medical doctors instead of saying one word about the terrorist attack that happened a few blocks not only from the White House but from the State Department,"" Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla told CNN in an interview on Tuesday.  Rodriguez Parrilla said the US government has shown little cooperation following the incident in April when a man opened fire on the Embassy, riddling the front of the building with gunfire. He said the State Department has been slow to share information and that senior administration officials failed to condemn the attack.  ""The attacker confessed that he aimed to kill. It's a very serious issue,"" Rodriguez Parrilla told CNN. ""Can you imagine that which would be the US reaction in a similar case of a similar attack against an American embassy anywhere in the world?""  The Trump administration has tightened economic sanctions on Cuba and asked countries not to accept Cuban medical assistance to fight the coronavirus outbreak, arguing that the doctors and nurses Cuba sends are underpaid and used for propaganda purposes.  But the US State Department said that despite political differences, Cuban diplomats are safe in the US.  ""The Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service works closely with law enforcement agencies to protect and maintain the security and safety of foreign missions in the United States,"" said a statement issued by the US Embassy in Havana on Tuesday. ""The US law enforcement process is transparent with strict jurisprudence and many records about cases and court proceedings publicly available.""  Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Eduardo Rodriguez Parrilla at UN Headquarters in New York on September 28, 2019.  Cuban citizen arrested for attack  Embassy surveillance video of the incident released by the Cuban government to CNN showed the alleged assailant arriving by car at around 2 am ET on April 30th and opening fire through a fence with an automatic weapon.  The video shows white plumes of smoke in the dark night air as a fusillade of bullets hit the front of the Embassy, breaking a window and piercing a metal statue of Cuban revolutionary hero Jose MartÃ­. Nobody was injured, although 10 Cuban diplomats and staff were inside and bullets entered the building.  Police arrested Alexander Alazo, a Cuban citizen living in the US, and charged him with possessing an unregistered firearm and assault with intent to kill as well as charges related to attacking a foreign embassy. Alazo is currently detained awaiting trial.  Police said they recovered an AK-47 and 32 spent shells from the scene, according to court documents. A gasoline-soaked Cuban flag was also recovered from the scene with hand-written messages including ""Trump 2020,"" according to the documents.  In the documents, police say Alazo told them that he had been hearing voices and attacked the Embassy ""because he wanted to get them before they got him, referring to the Cuban government.""  Alazo told investigators he was afraid Cuban ""criminal organizations"" might be tracking him and had been living out of his car for nine months before the Embassy attack.  A court-appointed attorney for Alazo did not return messages from CNN requesting comment Tuesday.  Rodriguez Parrilla said Alazo had completed his military service on the island and had no history of criminal conduct or mental illness before he moved to Mexico in 2003 and then to the US. He'd also returned to Cuba eight times and had worked as a pastor on the island, he said."
9,Hong Kong is pushing a controversial national anthem bill just as protests are kicking off again,"Hong Kong (CNN) After five months of being at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic, new infections in Hong Kong have slowed to a trickle, and the city is slowly getting back to normal . Which, these days, means protests .  Many are not waiting for the final coronavirus restrictions to be lifted. During protests over the weekend, police arrested some 230 people on a variety of charges, including unlawful assembly and refusing to abide by social distancing regulations.  Such disturbances are only likely to increase, with summer being the city's traditional protest season around the key anniversaries of June 4, for the Tiananmen Square massacre , and July 1, which marks Hong Kong's handover to Chinese control, as well as a host of new key dates created by last year's protests  The government has attempted to wield public opinion against the protesters, pointing out that people are already hurting economically from the coronavirus crisis and now is not the time for further public disturbance. The heavy police response to initial protests also seems designed to dissuade anyone on the fence from joining in.  At the same time, however, the government is pushing ahead with a piece of legislation that -- like the extradition bill that kicked off last year's protests -- has sparked concern among moderate Hong Kongers about increasing Chinese encroachment and undermining of the city's political freedoms.  On Tuesday, the government said lawmakers will resume debate on the Chinese national anthem bill on May 27. The proposed law will make it a crime punishable by up to three years in prison ""to insult the national anthem.""  ""The national anthem is the symbol and sign of the country,"" Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong's chief secretary and number two official, said in a statement. ""(The purpose of the law) is to preserve the dignity of the national anthem so that members of the community would respect the national anthem.""  Hong Kong is part of China, but the semi-autonomous city has its own legal and political system, with limited democracy and greater personal freedoms than on the mainland. The city competes as itself in many arenas, such as the Olympics and international football matches, but uses China's national anthem, ""March of the Volunteers,"" which is also played at official ceremonies.

Previous laws introduced in Hong Kong by law of Annex III include Per Article 18 of the Basic Law , ""laws listed in Annex III ... shall be confined to those relating to defense and foreign affairs as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the Region.""Previous laws introduced in Hong Kong by law of Annex III include regulations regarding China's exclusive economic zone , which has an effect on territorial claims in the South China Sea, and legislation regarding foreign banks.  That this can be applied to cover legislation regulating the country's national anthem shows the fairly broad remit Beijing sees the law as providing. What checks exist on this ability are only really provided by the Hong Kong legislature, and the local government's previously stated commitment to allowing lawmakers to debate such laws rather than simply promulgating them unilaterally.  Nor is Annex III the only way the Chinese government can influence laws in the semi-autonomous city, beyond its appointment of Hong Kong's leader and influence on pro-Beijing lawmakers. The NPC can also issue ""interpretations"" of constitutional issues, such as in 2016, when it intervened in a debate over oath-taking to rule that lawmakers who had staged protests during their swearing-in ceremony had voided their election and were barred from taking their seats.  Hong Kong's legislature began debating the national anthem law early last year, before the protests over the extradition bill brought all procedures to a stop and shut down the legislature for several months. In its statement Tuesday, the government said it wanted to pass the law before the current legislative session ends in July and any outstanding work becomes defunct, meaning the entire process would have to start over again.

MUST WATCH Hong Kong football fans boo China's anthem (2017) 01:16  Sweeping powers  Passage of the law seems inevitable without the kind of radical action taken by protesters last year to block the extradition bill. Opposition lawmakers do not have the numbers to block the law, and while filibustering and other procedural tactics have succeeded in slowing it in the committee stage, they have largely run their course.  Once law, it will be illegal to misuse or insult ""March of the Volunteers,"" with offenders subject to a fine of up to $6,450 (50,000 HKD), and three years in prison. Schoolchildren, including those at international schools, would also be legally required to learn the anthem, which opens with the line, ""Arise, we who refuse to be slaves!""  Multiple legal and human rights bodies have criticized the law for undermining freedom of expression and contravening Hong Kong's constitutional protections.  Both the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Progressive Lawyer's Group (PLG), which represent legal professionals in the city, raised concerns that the wording of the law left it open to abuse and uncertainty, with the PLG saying in a statement that it is ""poorly drafted and appallingly lacking in clarity.""  joint statement from 38 Hong Kong civil society groups warned the law ""could have chilling effects on dissent and become a tool for the government to suppress opposition.""  Pro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick shouts at security trying to restrain him during an angry Legislative Council session in Hong Kong on May 8, 2020.  Long year ahead  A spokesman for Hong Kong's Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau said Tuesday that the spirit of the bill was ""respect,"" adding that a person would only commit an offense if they publicly and intentionally insulted the national anthem. He denied that the law was ""draconian"" or that there was any risk of ""suppressing the freedom of speech.""  Government officials have previously said they hope not to see any prosecutions, that the law itself would be sufficient to engender ""respect"" for the anthem, a suggestion ridiculed by opposition lawmakers.  ""Respect cannot be won via legislation,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told CNN last year. ""Respect has to be won by oneself. You cannot threaten and force others to respect you unwillingly.""  Nor are protesters who have regularly taken to using the phrase ""Chinazi"" and defacing the Chinese flag during demonstrations likely to stand and salute as ""March of the Volunteers"" plays.  If and when the bill passes, its revocation will likely become another protest demand, as anti-government unrest will inevitably kick into high gear again."
10,India coronavirus: The way these states handled the virus shows the country's vast divide,"New Delhi, India (CNN) In January this year, Kerala became the first Indian state to report a coronavirus case . Now, four months later, it claims it has flattened the curve.  Although India has been under a strict nationwide lockdown since late March, cases have continued to rise -- the country of 1.3 billion now has more than 74,000 confirmed cases, including more than 2,400 deaths.  But Kerala, a thin strip on the country's southern coast, has appeared to buck that trend.  Although its has a population of around 36 million -- almost as big as Canada -- it has reported just 519 cases and four deaths. As of Saturday, it had only 16 active cases, according to the state's finance minister, Thomas Isaac.  Medical staff collect samples from people at a kiosk to test for Covid-19 in Kerala, India, on April 6, 2020.  For comparison, Maharashtra, the worst-affected state in India, has reported more than 23,000 cases , including more than 860 deaths.  Even accounting for their different population sizes, the states have very different outbreaks. Maharashtra has around 19 cases per 100,000, while Kerala has about 1. By way of comparison the United States, which has the world's highest reported death toll, has around 415 cases per 100,000 people.  Experts say part of Kerala's success is thanks to swift action and learning from past outbreaks. But Kerala also shows how disparate India is -- and how much a person's chances against the virus depend on where in the country they live.  What Kerala did right  At the center of Kerala's response was woman who has been nicknamed ""the coronavirus slayer.""  In the second week of January -- before the state, and by extension India, had reported its first coronavirus case -- Kerala's Minister of Health and Social Welfare, KK Shailaja, noticed reports of a virus spreading in Wuhan, China.  With many students from Kerala studying in Wuhan, KK Shailaja suspected it was just a matter of time before the virus arrived in the state. In late January, the ministry set up 18 expert groups for different facets of the outbreak control, covering everything from contact tracing and screening, to logistics and mental health. ""We planned everything,"" she says.  From January 24, the government screened all passengers returning from China, and sent all symptomatic patients to designated isolation facilities. On January 30 , Kerala confirmed its first coronavirus patient -- a student who had been studying in Wuhan.  Authorities identified the first patient by screening all 172 passengers on a plane from Wuhan, and isolating three students who had minor symptoms in hospital. They were also able to trace more than 70 people who had been in close contact with the students, Shailaja said.  And even when there were no new cases, the state continued being vigilant.  ""Some asked us why we were being so overactive because there were no cases now in Kerala,"" she says. ""We were told we over reacting but we didn't withdraw our teams because we were reading about this virus going to other countries.""  As Oommen Kurian, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, put it: ""(Kerala) reacted as if it's a very deadly disease from the beginning when people were actually doubtful across the world about the deadliness of the virus.""  Back in 2018, the state was hit by an outbreak of Nipah virus, which killed 18 people within a few weeks. There is no treatment or vaccine for Nipah, which has a fatality rate of between 40 to 75% -- much higher than Covid-19  Kerala managed to contain the disease in a short space of time -- and the most important thing was contact tracing, Shailaja said.  Indian citizens evacuated from Maldives arrive at the Cochin port in Kochi in the south Indian state of Kerala on May 10, 2020.  ""We understood that for any contagious virus, the first thing we have to do is contact tracing and to break the chain,"" she said. ""If we trace the contact properly, we can isolate the person from others and we can break the chain and flatten the curve of the epidemic. This is the same thing we applied here.""  ""Kerala acted from the beginning ... and has not lowered its guard yet,"" said Rajeev Sadanandan, Kerala's former health secretary and the chief executive of non-profit Health Systems Transformation Platform. ""No other Indian state did anything remotely comparable.""  How Kerala compares  Hundreds of miles north in the state of Maharashtra, health authorities haven't seen the same success. The state -- which has roughly the same population size as Japan -- has the largest number of cases of anywhere in India. Many of those are in Mumbai, one of India's most populous cities, which is home to a number of slums.  According to Amey Ghole, Health Committee Chairman of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, the city took the outbreak seriously ""from day one.""  ""On February 19, we found our first patient and admitted them to hospital. We were the first to stop flights from China. Maharashtra was the first state to lockdown the cinemas and malls,"" he said.  The state took other measures. On March 16, the state health minister, Rajesh Tope, announced that it would use indelible ink to stamp the hands of individuals who have been asked to self-quarantine at their own homes to prevent them from going out.  The state created containment zones and cordoned off areas, Ghole said. Authorities have been testing in slums -- which have been a big concern in India -- and increased the number of beds in quarantine facilities, he said.  But according to Kurian, Maharashtra didn't act as quickly as Kerala. Like much of the rest of the world, they were biding their time. ""Maharashtra was reactive,"" he added, rather than proactive.  Sadanandan said Maharashtra had no contact tracing system, so when cases showed up at hospitals, they had no way of using information about their contacts to prevent further spread.  Once infection reaches the community, prevention doesn't work, said Sadanandan. In places where community spread has taken hold, it's already too late to put in place Kerala's strategy of quarantining high-risk people, testing and treating them, and tracking everyone they have had contact with.  Groom Vitthal Koditkar, left, of Hirpodi village speaks with his bride Vrushali Renuse, right, of Pabe village and family members after their wedding during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown at Pabe village in Pune district in Maharashtra, India.  ""Slums or any community are the endpoints. The battle is lost when it has reached the community,"" he said.  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has repeatedly denied any community transmission across India.  Unlike Kerala, Maharashtra hadn't dealt with a recent viral outbreak, so they weren't as prepared for the onslaught, Kurian said. Now, it's too late to bring in strong contact tracing, he said. If Maharashtra were to start contact tracing now, it would have an uphill task -- it now has more than 23,000 confirmed cases, who have likely each been in touch with a number of people.  ""The thing about contact tracing is that it is very easy to get overwhelmed if you go over the threshold,"" he said. ""The silent spread has already happened in Maharashtra.""  Why Kerala's success isn't a surprise  In a way, it's no surprise that Kerala has had success against the coronavirus -- it already has some of the best healthcare outcomes in India.  According to government statistics, Kerala has a comparatively high number of public healthcare centers. It also has the lowest maternal mortality rate, one of the lowest infant mortality rates, and the highest life expectancy at birth of any Indian state, at 74.2 for a man.  According to Sadanandan, Kerala has a good primary care system and well-trained health workers. Those things, in turn, meant the government health system had credibility and trust with the public, Sadanandan said.  It also helped that Kerala's literacy rate is high, with around 94% of the population literate, according to the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 73%. That improved the state's ability to communicate the risk, said Kurian.  ""Education was seen as an investment in Kerala for a long time,"" Kurian added.  Nurses light candles at Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Kochi, Kerala, on May 12, 2020, to mark International Nurses Day, celebrated on the birthday of Florence Nightingale.  And Kerala is relatively well-off. In 2017-2018, the latest year for which statistics are available, it had a per capita GDP of 184,000 Indian rupees , compared with a nationwide average of 114,958.  Kerala's health outcomes are not the norm. Healthcare -- and social indicators such as access to safe drinking water that influence healthcare outcomes -- vary widely between different states, Sadanandan said.  Maharashtra's health outcomes fall far behind Kerala. Male life expectancy is 69.9, and its infant mortality rate is almost twice as high as Kerala's, with 19 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 10.  Although Maharashtra has some of the best hospitals in India, according to Kurian, some of those have been compromised because the virus has spread to health care workers and within hospitals. Last month, the Indian Medical Association said doctors in India faced challenges of being attacked and had a lack of personal protective equipment.  ""Many doctors have tested positive for the virus already and those of us working on the frontlines at government hospitals live in hostels where effective social distancing is not possible,"" a Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors spokesperson said.  What the future holds  While Kerala has flattened the curve for now, the challenges aren't over. ""We are bracing ourselves for the 3rd wave,"" Isaac, the state's finance minister, tweeted . Kerala's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has a similar sentiment: ""Til those who are undergoing treatment are fully cured and those under observation complete their quarantine period, we cannot let our guard down one bit.""  India's lockdown is set to lift later this month, and some experts expect cases to increase.  India stopped commercial flights into the country in March, but last week it began repatriation flights for Indians overseas who are stranded or lost their jobs. Kerala has large numbers of people working and living overseas, meaning many of those being repatriated will be headed for Kerala.  And Kerala has the oldest population in India, making its population potentially more vulnerable -- 13% of the population are aged 60 or older, compared with the nationwide average of 8.2%. In Maharashtra, for comparison, 9.1% of the population are 60 or older.  Indian citizens evacuated from Maldives look outside the Indian Navy INS Jalashwa ship as it arrives to Cochin port in Kochi on May 10, 2020.  Kurian warns that it's not the time to be complacent.  ""The real fight is just coming. Once the international travelers come back and the migrants come back and the local economy starts operating again, That is when the next wave will hit Kerala, and if they're caught napping, it will look a lot like Mumbai.""  In 2017, Indian workers around the world sent $69 billion back home -- and 19% of those remittances went to Kerala, the highest proportion of any state, according to India's Central Bank. But Kurian points out that if some of Kerala's overseas workers have now lost their jobs, that could impact Kerala's overall economy.  ""Kerala is best practice sponsored by the rest of the world,"" he said. ""The money that is supporting Kerala's public sector response, that tap has been turned off.""  But Sadanandan is more optimistic -- he thinks the same prevention strategy that worked before can continue to work now.  ""If prevention works with one, it can work with millions,"" he said. ""There would be hiccups but I expect the inherent strength of Kerala to survive the threat."""

12,"Quibi, Netflix's weirdest rival, is off to a rough start","The streaming service, which offers mobile videos and series that are cut into segments shorter than 10 minutes , garnered a lot of attention when it launched on April 6 . But the payoff has been muted, and the service's growth is anemic.  Jeffrey Katzenberg, Quibi's founder, told the New York Times on Monday that he attributes ""everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus... But we own it.""  Yet Meg Whitman, Quibi's CEO, struck a different tone when speaking with CNN Business Monday night. Whitman said she's happy with the service's performance so far.  ""You have to remember, we're a new brand with original content, a new tech platform that was built from the ground up,"" Whitman said. ""We came to market with no library, no legacy product and we're starting from scratch.""  Quibi has roughly 1.3 million active users -- a tiny base compared to more than 50 million Disney+ customers and 183 million Netflix users. And most of Quibi's customers are in the 90-day free trial period. Afterward, the service costs $4.99 a month with ads, and $7.99 a month without. (Quibi is available only in the United States and Canada, while Disney+ and Netflix are global brands.)  eBay EBAY Netflix NFLX Whitman, who is the former CEO ofand HP, argues that growth in the streaming world always takes time, going back to the early days ofor Hulu -- and finding an audience is decidedly more difficult right now.  ""I know how hard it is to gain people's attention, particularly in a pandemic,"" she said. ""But I feel really good about where we are, even though we're five weeks old.""  Yet other streaming services have thrived with people being stuck at home. Netflix reported a huge bump in subscribers last month  A difficult time to launch  As for Katzenberg, he told the Times that he's unhappy with the company's results so far.  ""Is it the avalanche of people that we wanted and were going for out of launch?"" he said. ""The answer is no. It's not up to what we wanted. It's not close to what we wanted.""  Since it was announced, Quibi has been seen as a risky proposition  Its sales pitch was different than most streaming services in that it offered easily digestible content that came with high production budgets, and all of it could only be watched on a mobile phone.  Disney DIS The company courted A-list talent like Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Lopez and raised over $1.75 billion in funding from investors like, CNN's parent company WarnerMedia and the e-commerce company Alibaba.  Quibi was ultimately meant to be a service for users on the go, which is a selling point that disappeared after coronavirus forced people to stay inside.  However, Quibi has other fundamental issues beyond coronavirus, according to Michael Goodman, director of TV and media strategies at Strategy Analytics.  ""It's not really unexpected that Quibi has a rough start,"" Goodman told CNN Business. ""Being a mobile-only streaming service was always a risky bet. I mean, most services are multi-platform and consumers have made it clear that they don't want to be dictated to in how they watch entertainment. The coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the underlying issues that Quibi has as a service.""  Rocky start  Quibi called the lawsuit meritless. ""As we made clear in our filing, Quibi's patented Turnstyle feature is the result of the work from our talented engineering team,"" a Quibi spokesperson said in a statement. ""When a new product launches, these types of claims are unfortunately too common.""  So to say it's been a rough start is an understatement, but it's unclear if Quibi is suffering from the pandemic or if it's suffering from being Quibi, according to Goodman.  ""Quibi is the outlier in this pandemic among streaming services because other services have seen a boom lately. So is this a product that consumers actually want? That's the question right now,"" he said. ""Time will tell if they can turn it around, and we might not know until the pandemic ends, but I believe they have a really difficult road ahead of them.""  CEO Whitman insists there's a path forward.  ""I think you'll see nice, slow and steady growth as we head through the pandemic. And then maybe when we get to the other side of the pandemic, we'll see some accelerating growth,"" Whitman said. ""That's my expectation. I feel pretty good about that."""
13,"No one is buying pants, but pajama sales are soaring","New York (CNN Business) Coronavirus has upended the way people shop, sparking serious deals for some items -- an hefty price increases for others.  Online purchases rocketed higher last month, according to an Adobe Analytics study released Thursday. That's not a huge surprise: Many people can't or don't want to leave home to shop during the pandemic.  The massive boost in online buying turned April into a giant Black Friday sale, Adobe Analytics said. For some retailers, online traffic rivaled the day after Thanksgiving. Other companies heavily discounted items that haven't sold well during the pandemic, giving customers Black-Friday-like deals.  Apparel  Working from home in the coronavirus age means Americans are buying a lot more groceries and far fewer pants online.  To persuade customers to shop, online clothing stores dropped their prices to the floor. Clothing stores were forced to slash prices by an average of 12% between March and April -- the largest monthly price decrease on record for Adobe Analytics.  That helped boost apparel sales, which rose 34% over the same period,  ""We've never seen anything like that for us for apparel,"" said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst for the Adobe digital insights group. ""Right now [apparel companies] are experiencing the kind of pricing that they'd normally get during Black Friday.""  Many major apparel retailers were forced to close physical stores because of stay-at-home orders. Americans who don't have to travel to work also don't need to buy clothes to wear to the office, the gym, or to other social outings.  That helped boost pajama sales by 143% but fueled a 13% sales decline for pants, Adobe Analytics said. The price for bras also dropped by 12%.  A picture of the exterior of a New York City H&M store.  H&M, Adidas and many other retailers reported devastating sales declines during the past several months. S&P Global Market Intelligence also cited a third fewer apparel exports from China during the pandemic.  Soaring sales  Overall, ecommerce sales were up 49% last month, and categories such as online grocery, electronics and books doubled.  Adobe Analytics, which aggregates and analyzes more than a trillion data points from digital retailers that use its software -- including 80 of the top 100 ecommerce sites -- found online grocery store sales surged by 110% between March and April, according to data provided to CNN Business.  Creative audio equipment and alcohol sellers also experienced an e-commerce boom last month, according to Adobe Analytics.  The research group found collective online sales for wine, beer, and spirits surged 74% between March 11 and April 21. The sale of creative audio equipment like microphones and sound mixers rose a whopping 459% in April, according to Pandya, the Adobe Analytics lead analyst.  ""I'd attribute that to people wanting to express creativity at this time,"" Pandya said. ""When people realize they're going to be in quarantine for an extended period of time, they reckon with that.""  That soaring demand has led to some serious price increases for some online items. Prices of electronics, in particular, have risen: Computer prices soared 3.1% last month. Toys were 1.5% more expensive in April than in March. That trend upends years of precedent in which the best deals were found on ecommerce platforms, such as Amazon.  But those sales gains weren't enough to erase the overall losses major retailers have experienced from an economic downturn that has Americans shopping less overall, noted Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst with Forrester.  ""It will take a long time for sales to get back to normal and for people to feel comfortable heading back to stores,"" Kodali said. ""We are in the midst of a recession, possibly a depression. If there's a nonessential retailer that can thrive in that retail environment, I want to know who they are."""

The decision reflects how some measures implemented to deal with the pandemic could lead to a new normal for corporate America, even after the immediate health crisis.  Twitter TWTR did not specify which roles will qualify for the treatment. But the company said the experience of working from home for the past several months has shown that it can work at scale.

""If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it's safe to return.""  The company does not expect to open most of its offices, or support business travel, before September. It has also canceled all of its internal company events through 2020, and could potentially extend that into 2021, the statement said.  Read More"
15,"Report: LeBron, Giannis, Steph Curry, More Stars in Favor of NBA Resuming Season","Jesse D. Garrabrant/Getty Images  LeBron James and the biggest stars in the NBA have reportedly ""formed a united front to resume the 2019-20 season,"" which has been on hiatus because of the coronavirus, according to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports.  NBPA President and Oklahoma City Thunder guard Chris Paul arranged a private conference call Monday that reportedly included James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook.  ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Tuesday the NBPA was polling players about whether they wanted the season to continue.  The players' association denied the report and said it ""has not authorized any formal poll of its players,"" per Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic.  The league has been patient about a potential return, with Commissioner Adam Silver reportedly saying a decision didn't need to be made in May, per Wojnarowski.  Teams were allowed to reopen facilities last week, though some organizations must remain closed for at least several more weeks based on local restrictions.  Some team executives and agents have reportedly called for the NBA to cancel the remainder of the season, according to Jabari Young of CNBC.  However, there is at least some support among players to return and determine a champion.  The stars on the call carry a lot of weight with 71 combined All-Star appearances and nine MVP awards among the nine players Hayes listed.  Though James and Antetokounmpo would have a lot to gain with a returnâ€”the Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks would be expected to contend for the titleâ€”that's not the case with all the others. Curry and Lillard are on teams that would not currently land in the playoff field, while Durant hasn't played all season while recovering from an Achilles injury.  As Haynes noted, a canceled season could have lasting effects regarding the collective bargaining agreement.  This group of high-profile players could help push the league toward a restart."
16,Woj: NBA Discussed Comfort with a Few Positive Tests Not Derailing Return,"Jae C. Hong/Associated Press  NBA Commissioner Adam Silver reportedly discussed a number of topics regarding the league's potential return during a call with the Board of Governors on Tuesday.  ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the news, noting attendees left ""feeling positive about momentum toward an NBA return to play this season."" However, part of the conversation was about how the league and its players will need to accept the reality that some positive tests for COVID-19 would not shut down the league if it does finish the 2019-20 season and playoffs.  Silver said if one test would ""shut us down, we probably shouldn't go down this path,"" described a centralized location for playing games as a ""campus environment"" and is looking at how other sports leagues both inside and outside the United States are working toward returning to play amid the coronavirus pandemic, per Wojnarowski.  The report also noted the league will study factors such as developments in testing and the trajectory of new cases for the next two-to-four weeks before making a final decision on returning.  This comes after Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported both the league and its players association planned on conducting a call Tuesday that included Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Jayson Tatum and Kyle Lowry, among other players, to discuss potentially finishing the season.  Charania noted the players association ""sent a memo to agents stating sense is players and NBA both want to finish the 2019-20 season.""  Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reported Paul, who is the president of the players association, organized a private conference call Monday with some of the league's most notable players such as LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Westbrook, Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard.  Those stars agreed they want to play again if there are safety measures in place, although Haynes cited sources who said ""the majority of players"" on those teams not in playoff contention prefer a restart that jumps straight into the playoffs.  While teams were permitted to reopen facilities last week, a number of organizations have not done so because of local restrictions in place.  Wojnarowski reported Monday that the NBA is looking at a ""really dire"" financial outlook with play suspended, especially since fans may not be in attendance at games into the 2020-21 season. If that becomes the case, the league and players association may have to ""reconfigure the elements of the CBA."""

The 33-year-old also works as a physician assistant, and she has been working 12-hour shifts for the last three months in the emergency room at Regional Medical Center in San Jose, California, during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, according to the Los Angeles Times' Kevin Baxter.  ""Neither field is really black or white,"" Koroleva told Baxter. ""There are pathways we take based on gut instinct that are largely dependent on previous knowledge and understanding the situation.""  She added: ""It was a very hectic time. We opened a separate COVID area to separate patients with concerning symptoms. And there was a constant changing of requirements and guidelines by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention].""  Baxter noted that Koroleva cared for as many as 10 patients per day.

18,China's CCTV Reiterates It Has No Intention of Airing NBA Games,"Uncredited/Associated Press  Should the 2019-20 NBA season resume, China's state-owned television network will continue to freeze out the league because of Daryl Morey's tweet in support of pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.  NBA China hired Michael Ma as its chief executive officer Tuesday. His father, Ma Guoli, was a top executive for CCTV Sports, an arm of the country's TV network.  ""Michael Ma's hiring led to speculation in China that the connection could help lead to the NBA getting back on the television giant after they've been off the air all season,"" ESPN's Brian Windhorst wrote.  However, Windhorst pointed to a statement from CCTV in which it said it was ""reiterating its consistent stance on national sovereignty.""  The fallout from Morey's tweet was swift and far-reaching. The NBA's official partners in China all suspended their deals with the league, and CCTV declined to broadcast any regular-season games.  NBA commissioner Adam Silver confirmed Chinese government officials also asked for Morey to be fired. Silver issued a statement saying the NBA wasn't going to punish team or league personnel for exercising opinions on political issues:  ""It is inevitable that people around the world -- including from America and China -- will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.  ""However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.""  The frayed relations with China have hit the NBA's bank account. Silver told reporters in February the league wasn't going to lose $1 billion in revenue, as had been reported, and that it's ""probably less than $400 million, maybe even less than that.""  Still, that's a significant amount of money, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further clouded the NBA's financial outlook.  Navigating the pandemic is enough of a headache for Silver and NBA executives. Repairing the league's partnerships in China looms on the horizon as well."
19,Kobe Bryant-Partnered 'Mamba Sports Academy' Rebranded as 'Sports Academy',"Stefanie Dazio/Associated Press  The Mamba Sports Academy announced Tuesday it will revert to its original name, Sports Academy, after its partnership with the family of Kobe Bryant ended after 14 months of ""extraordinary"" success.  In a statement, the company said:  ""Like tens of millions of fans around the globe, Sports Academy's world drastically changed on Jan. 26, 2020. Today, with respect for an unparalleled legacy, the Academy will retire the 'Mamba' in the Mamba Sports Academy nameâ€”to raise it to the rafters, where it belongs. In doing so, Sports Academy will carry on the vision it curated during that special partnership.""  Bryant died in a helicopter crash in California on Jan. 26.  He partnered with Sports Academy CEO Chad Faulkner in 2018 to help create a ""full-circle facility"" dedicated to maximizing human performance.  The company, which was founded by Faulkner in 2016, was rebranded based on the ""Mamba Mentality,"" a term Bryant used throughout his career to help explain how he became one of the best players in NBA history.  ""Mamba Mentality isn't about seeking a result. It's about the journey and the approach. It's a way of life,"" the five-time NBA champion said.  He served as coach of the academy's girls basketball team that featured his daughter Gianna Bryant, who also died in January's crash.  Although the partnership has ended, the company said its ""mission remains unchanged."""

Around the world, some governments are beginning to slowly relax their social-distancing restrictions.  Most countries have taken measures to protect against the spread of Covid-19: enforcing stay-at-home orders, closing nonessential businesses and advising people to wear protective gear and keep a safe distance from one another.  Many of those guidelines still apply. But beaches are beginning to reopen, some students are returning to classrooms, and businesses are opening their doors for the first time in weeks."

The Muslim holy month of Ramadan has begun, and the holiday looks much different than it has in years past.  Because of the coronavirus pandemic, many Islamic holy sites remain empty, including Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Worshippers are being advised to pray at home.  Other mosques are trying to practice social distancing."
22,Australian lawmaker tested for Covid-19 after coughing fit in parliament,"(CNN) An Australian lawmaker has been tested for Covid-19 after a coughing fit in parliament on Tuesday made it difficult for him to finish his speech.  Video footage shows Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg having to pause several times to get his breath back, taking sips of water in a bid to reclaim his voice.  ""I'm lucky I have some water,"" he said, coughing. ""Too long of a speech.""  Frydenberg said it would take years to pay back money borrowed to fight coronavirus.  Frydenberg later revealed that he had entered self-isolation and was tested for coronavirus, according to CNN affiliate 9News.  ""Today while delivering my ministerial statement I had a dry mouth and a cough,"" said Frydenberg in a statement seen by 9News."
23,The 34 most staggering lines from Donald Trump's Rose Garden press conference,"(CNN) President Donald Trump sought to preempt potentially damaging congressional testimony Tuesday on the state of testing and the reopening of the country by taking to the Rose Garden Monday afternoon to make a series of incorrect claims about the ongoing fight against coronavirus. He also continued his ongoing war with the media.  I went through the transcript and pulled out the lines you should see. They're below.  In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!  1. ""We're here today to provide an update on the unprecedented testing capacity developed by the United States, the most advanced and robust testing system anywhere in the world, by far.""  2. ""We have really had a very good relationship with the states and the governors and other representatives within the states, a relationship.""  ""She's not stepping up. All she does is sit there and blame the federal government. She doesn't get it done. And we send her a lot."" -- Donald Trump on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer  ""Governor Cuomo should spend more time 'doing' and less time 'complaining'. Get out there and get the job done."" -- Donald Trump on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo  ""@JBPritzker, Governor of Illinois, and a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News @CNN & Concast (MSDNC), shouldn't be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings."" -- Donald Trump on Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker  3. ""It should have never been allowed to happen; it should have been stopped at the source.""  This is a common line for Trump now as he seeks to lay blame for coronavirus on the Chinese and their demonstrated lack of transparency in terms of the virus and its initial spread. At the same time, it seems a lot to ask of any country to ""stop"" a virus with the level of transmissibility that Covid-19 has. After all, the US knew the virus was headed our way for months and we now have more than 1 million cases and more than 80,000 dead  4. ""In every generation, through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task. We have met the moment and we have prevailed.""  Worth noting that the latest IHME model projects more than 134,000 American deaths by early August. Which would mean that roughly 53,000 people will die between today and August 4. Those people don't likely believe that ""we have prevailed.""  5. ""In the fourth quarter we're going to do very good and next year I think we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had because there's a tremendous pent-up demand.""  Worth noting this is a timeline change for Trump. He had long insisted that the economy would immediately bounce back once the country began reopening. He is now suggesting that it won't be until 2021 when things will truly recover.  6. ""I've felt things a lot over my life and I've made a lot of good calls.""  [opens mouth to say something, decides against it]  7. ""But we're transitioning to greatness and the greatness is going to be in the fourth quarter but it's really going to be next year and it's going to be a year like we've never had before.""  A lot of people focus on the fourth quarter. But it's the fifth quarter that really matters! That's where greatness is most effectively transitioned  8. ""We had the best economy in the history of the world, not just here but anywhere in the world.""  9. ""We had the best economy anywhere in the world and we were going for numbers, whether it was unemployment numbers where we had our best numbers. Employment also numbers. Little different.""  10. ""Now we had one of the best weeks in the history of our border between the United States and Mexico, our southern border. We had very few people coming in, very, very few.""  [raises hand tentatively] Might that slowdown in border crossings be due to the pandemic raging in our country?  11. ""But again, we've had the best numbers.""  Beautiful numbers. The greatest. Many people are saying it.  12. ""It's the hidden enemy. Remember that. It's the hidden enemy. So, things happen.""  ""Things happen."" So true.  13. ""The one who tested positive will be fine, will be absolutely fine.""  14. ""This building is shocking, if you look at the numbers.""  Donald Trump on the White House.  15. ""Very soon. I mean, really, very soon.""  This is Trump's response to a question on when the average person will be able to be tested for coronavirus ""every day as they go back to work."" There is very little evidence that we will have testing for all 160 million working Americans anytime soon. Or even ""very soon.""  16. ""You look at all of these machines here. They're incredible machines, the best anywhere in the world.""  17. ""Other countries are calling, sophisticated countries, and they're calling, lots of countries.""  ""Sophisticated countries,"" you say? Tell me more...  18.""They have learned about -- I see everybody, just about everybody has a face mask on.""  The President wasn't wearing a mask when he said this. And he doesn't plan to wear one . So, yeah.  19. ""They have learned about face masks, the good and the bad, by the way. It's not a one-sided thing, believe it or not.""  Masks can be bad? I suppose Trump is suggesting that people touch their faces more when they wear masks? I truly don't know.  20. ""No, we prevailed on testing is what I'm referring to. That was with regard to testing.""  So, Trump is editing his previous comment -- see No. 4 -- that his comments about having ""prevailed"" was solely about testing not about the broader fight against the virus. Even so, it's very hard to see how we have prevailed on testing -- at least yet.  21. ""And greatness is next year, right from the beginning.""  Mark your calendar: January 1, 2021 is when greatness begins.  22. ""In the case of me, I'm not -- I'm not close to anybody.""  This is Trump's defense for why he isn't wearing a mask. But it's not the real reason he isn't wearing a mask  23.""I understand you very well, better than you understand yourself.""  Did you not know that Trump was a psychiatrist? He already knew you didn't know that, by the way.  24. ""Now that we're doing so well on tests and so quick and so fast, five minutes, et cetera, and so accurate, you're complaining that we're getting too many tests. So you can't win.""  No one in the media is complaining about the number of tests available. The question is -- and has been -- when the average person will have the access to immediate and daily testing like the White House staff does.  25. ""As far as Americans getting a test, they should all be able to get a test right now. They should be able to get a test.""  Whether they ""should"" or not, they aren't.  26. ""They want our country open. I want our country open too. I want it open safely. But I want it open. Don't forget.""  To be clear, almost every single epidemiologist and infectious disease expert has made clear that the more a state reopens its economy, the more likely it is that coronavirus begins spreading rapidly in that state. I suppose this depends on what your meaning of ""safe"" is?  27. ""You can go with the enclosed route. Everything's closed up; you're in your house, you're not allowed to move. People are dying with that, too.""  No state passed any sort of guideline that required people to not be ""allowed to move.""  28. ""The 20,000 [cases] -- the numbers are way down from what they were two weeks ago. I mean, the numbers are really coming down; they're very substantially -- and this weekend was one of the lowest we've had. This is, you know, the numbers are coming down very rapidly -- all throughout the country, by the way.""  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there were more than 23,000 coronavirus cases diagnosed in the US on Sunday, May 10. A week prior -- May 3 -- there were more than 29,000 cases diagnosed. But just two days later, there were just over 22,000 diagnoses of Covid-19. In short, the numbers continue to bounce around a bit. But what's clear is that the numbers aren't coming down ""very rapidly.""  29. ""But as far as the models are concerned, if you go by the model, we were going to lose 2.2 million people.""  This was never going to be true. Not ever  30. ""We're at the lowest of all of the models. I mean, if you look at, I guess that 120,000 -- 100,000 to 120,000 people would be at the low side. And we're at -- there's nothing low.""  ""Now we're going toward 50,000 -- I'm hearing, or 60,000 people. One is too many. I always say it. One is too many, but we're going toward 50,000 or 60,000 people. That's at the lower -- as you know the lower (end of the projections) was supposed to be 100,000 people."" -- Donald Trump, April 21  31. ""You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.""  The question Trump was asked is this: What is the crime that Trump is accusing former President Barack Obama of committing ? And Trump's answer, of course, is not an answer at all. Because there is no crime. Or at least not one he -- or anyone else -- has elucidated.  32. ""Well they're losing their lives everywhere in the world and maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me, ask China that question, OK? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer.""  In which the President of the United States tells CBS News' Weijia Jiang, who was born in China but immigrated to the US at age 2, that she should ask China her question about why he is casting testing capacity as a global competition. Jiang replied by asking why Trump was ""saying that to me specifically, that I should ask China?"" To which Trump responded: ""I'm telling you -- I'm not saying it's specifically to anybody, I'm saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that."" Of course, he didn't say it to just anybody. He said it to a Chinese-American reporter. And if you think that was by accident, you haven't been paying attention for the past three years.  33. ""I did and you didn't respond and now I'm calling on the young lady in the back. Please?""  Trump called on CNN's Kaitlan Collins . Then he decided he didn't want her to ask a question. That's all that happened here.  34. ""OK. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, appreciate it. Thank you very much.""  And then Trump decided to just end the press conference -- mere seconds after he had called on Kaitlan and then the ""young lady in the back."" So, yeah, this feels like a good place to end."
24,"Trump says the US leads the world in testing. But it's far behind in testing per capita, studies show","""AMERICA LEADS THE WORLD IN TESTING""  ""We've prevailed on testing,"" Trump said Monday, standing between the signs.  While the US may have performed the most number of coronavirus tests, it's nowhere near the world's leader in testing per capita, multiple studies show.  And health experts say the US isn't close to the rate of testing needed to safely reopen the economy.  How many tests have been done?  By May 12, the US had conducted about 9.6 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project  As of May 11, the US has performed an average of 28.24 tests per 1,000 people, according to researchers from Oxford University  It's important to note some individuals have received multiple tests. For example, Vice President Mike Pence cited his frequent testing as a reason why he chose not to wear a face mask.  Public health experts say we don't need to test every American right now. But they say the US still isn't conducting enough tests to stop the spread of the virus enough to safely reopen the economy.  ""This is due to a growing consensus among experts that the US is faring worse in this outbreak than previously thought,"" the institute said. ""Social distancing measures have been able to stall the sharp increase of infection and death rates -- but unlike in many other nations, new cases are only very slowly decreasing.""  On Monday, Trump said the US is conducting about 300,000 tests per day.  How does the US stack up against other countries?  There's no single definitive ranking system because there are variations in how some countries report their testing.  ""The number of tests does not refer to the same in each country -- one difference is that some countries report the number of people tested, while others report the number of tests (which can be higher if the same person is tested more than once),"" the Oxford researchers said on their website OurWorldInData.org  So CNN looked at different rankings, and each study showed that many other countries have higher per capita testing rates.  As of April 26, the US ranked 22nd in the number of tests performed per capita, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  FactCheck.org , a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at Trump's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump's April claim about the US testing more than ""every country combined"" was ""way off.""  ""The U.S. total is indeed more than any single country has reportedly done -- but not more than all other countries combined,"" FactCheck.org said.  ""Adding together just the number of tests conducted by Russia, Germany and Italy -- the next three countries that have done the most testing -- would produce a higher figure. ... So, Trump's claim is not even close to being accurate.""  Republican senators say testing is still insufficient  Lawmakers have urged the administration to keep ramping up testing to help states allow businesses and schools to open.  ""All roads back to work and back to school run through testing. And that what our country has done so far on testing is impressive, but not nearly enough,"" Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said Tuesday.  Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, questioned the administration's touting of conducting more tests than South Korea, including more tests per capita than South Korea  And while South Korea has kept its Covid-19 deaths under 300, Romney noted, the US death toll is more than 82,000 and climbing  ""I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever,"" Romney said. ""The fact is (South Korea's) test numbers are going down, down, down now because they don't have the kind of outbreak now. Ours are going up, up, up, because they have to."""
